   Underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard, whose
deep-sea robot discovered the German battleship Bismarck on the
bottom of the Atlantic two weeks ago, said today he believed the
World War II vessel had been scuttled by its own crew.
   At a news conference to disclose details of the discovery,
Ballard said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory
that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by British fire in one
of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war.
   ``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
   The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the
robot called Argo, the same device that was used four years ago to
find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank
in 1912 after striking an iceberg.
   The Bismarck was the most powerful vessel in the German Navy when
it sank during a battle with the British on May 27, 1941. Of the
Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
   The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left
Gydnia, Poland, for her first operation, intended to attack convoys
of merchant shipping and damage British morale at a time when
England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air
power.
   The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck, but five
days after the Bismarck went to sea it sank the Hood with the loss
of all but three of the British vessel's crew of 1,419.
   The Hood was the largest warship in the world until the start of
World War II and symbolized British sea power, so its loss stunned
the British public and the war government and made sinking the
Bismarck a mission of the most crucial nature.
   Ballard said the Bismarck was found ``in a remarkable state of
preservation. There doesn't appear to be as much damage as I had
expected.''
   Ballard is a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts.
   The Bismarck was found in more than 15,000 feet of water about
600 miles west of Brest, France.

   Underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard, whose
deep-sea robot discovered the German battleship Bismarck on the
bottom of the Atlantic two weeks ago, said today he believed the
World War II vessel had been scuttled by its own crew.
   At a news conference to disclose details of the discovery,
Ballard said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory
that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by British fire in one
of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war.
   ``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
   Ballard said he could only speculate on why the German commander
decided to send his vessel to the bottom in May 1941. He said
perhaps it carried technologically advanced equipment that the
Germans did not want to fall into British hands.
   ``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he
said.
   In 1939, after a battle with three smaller British ships, the
German pocket battleship Graf Spee was cornered in the neutral port
of Montevideo, Uruguay. Adolf Hitler ordered it scuttled, possibly
to prevent the British from learning the secrets of its construction
and weapons.
   In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's four main guns were quickly
knocked out of action and the attacking British ships were out of
range of the Bismarck's secondary guns, Ballard said. With the ship
helpless and taking hundreds of hits, its sinking was clearly
inevitable, he said.
   Asked if the Germans couldn't have surrendered the ship to save
lives, Ballard said there was no mast left on which a white flag
could have been hoisted.
   Asked if the Germans couldn't have surrendered by ceasing fire,
Ballard said ``in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas it would have
been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the German
fire had ended.
   The British ships did halt their gunfire but continued to send
torpedos, Ballard said. However, he said, the lack of evidence of an
implosion in the remains persuaded him that the ship had been
blasted open by its own crew rather than sunk by British torpedoes.
   He said he would keep secret the exact location of the Bismarck
and let the German people decide its future fate.
   The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the
robot called Argo, the same device that was used four years ago to
find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank
in 1912 after striking an iceberg.

   A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests
that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was
scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a
celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said
Thursday.
   During a 90-minute news conference, Ballard described how he his
ocean-crawling robot located the Bismarck ``sitting upright and
proud'' two weeks ago.
   Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British
background and whose mother was of German heritage, addressed
himself to the German people in German.
   ``I am an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter,'' he said,
translating himself back into English. ``We found no human remains.
We touched nothing and took nothing. ... The future of the Bismarck
is in the hands of the German people.''
   He said he will disclose its exact location only to Germany so
Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship,
which sank after a battle May 27, 1941.
   Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him
that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to
surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire.
   ``Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one
piece,'' Ballard said. ``It appears the crew opened it up along its
entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.''
   ``Maybe the Germans didn't want it taken as a war prize,'' he
added.
   It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered the German
pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it was cornered in the
neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked by British ships.
Hitler apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the
secrets of the Graf Spee's construction and weapons.
   In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked
out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her
secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking
hundreds of hits _ its sinking clearly inevitable.
   Rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabric-covered
British biplanes, it was unable to escape.
   Asked if the German commander couldn't have surrendered by
ceasing fire, Ballard said ``in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas
it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized
that the Germans were giving up.
   Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's
technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hands.
   The Bismarck was found by Ballard in more than 15,000 feet of
water about 600 miles west of Brest, France. He said it was in
remarkably good shape, ``elegant, well preserved.''
   Before the battle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had
left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit
with a ringing three-word command: ``Sink the Bismarck!''
   Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived.
British ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of
German sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might
have been a German U-boat. German vessels later rescued only five
more survivors.
   The story has been recounted in books, songs and a movie.
   The sinking occurred only eight days after the Bismarck left
Gdynia, Poland, for her first operation. If unstopped, it could have
posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut
British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against
combined German sea and air power.
   The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within
five days of going to sea the Bismarck had sunk the Hood in a
three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the
vessel's crew of 1,419.
   The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned
the British public and the war government and made sinking the
Bismarck a mission of crucial importance.
   Ballard said under laws of the sea, the Bismarck remains the
property of the German people.
   The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same
remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four years ago to find the
wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912
after striking an iceberg.

   After a fruitless search last year, the German
battleship Bismarck has been found on the ocean floor 600 miles off
the coast of France, 48 years after it was sunk by the British Navy.
   The Bismarck was located Monday under 15,000 feet of water by a
remote-controlled robot named Argo that scuttles across the ocean
floor. Argo and his master, expedition leader Dr. Robert Ballard,
also discovered the sunken Titanic four years ago.
   The Bismarck was sitting upright on the sea floor ``intact in an
excellent state of preservation'' about 600 miles west of Brest on
the Brittany coast, said Ballard, who is based at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod.
   The discovery is likely to trigger great curiosity among naval
historians, said Maj. Charles Neimeyer, a history professor at the
U.S. Naval Academy.
   ``They'll be looking for the sort of technology the Germans had
at the time, because this ship was considered state-of-the-art,'' he
said. The find could answer questions about the way the ship went
down and ``how the crew lived and survived at sea on a German
warship,'' he added.
   No human remains were found near the Bismarck, on which all but
about 100 of the 2,200 crew members perished. A memorial service for
those who perished was held aboard one of the expedition's ships.
   The ship will be left undisturbed as a grave site, like the
Titanic, according to David Gallo, assistant director of the Center
for Marine Exploration at Woods Hole. The battleship might be
explored by the sophisticated robot, though, Gallo said.
   Ballard and a research team searched several days for the
Bismarck last year. Instead of the Bismarck, the explorers found a
19th century sailing ship that has yet to be identified, Gallo said.
   ``There were quite a few reports about its position when it
sank,'' Gallo said. ``But the problem is, those reports can be off
by a mile or more, and a mile at sea, when you're looking at the sea
floor, represents a very large area to be covered in a search.''
   The demise of the dreaded Bismarck, which was equipped with eight
15-inch guns, began on May 24, 1941, when it encountered the Royal
Navy off the coast of Greenland.
   The Bismarck sank Britain's battle cruiser Hood but was hit by
the Prince of Wales. The Germans then fled south for occupied France
with the British in pursuit.
   Two days later, British warships and aircraft located the
crippled vessel and launched a furious attack. The Bismarck finally
went down the next day.
   The successful campaign was a significant victory for the Allies,
who thwarted Hitler's plan to use the Bismarck to raid Atlantic
Ocean shipping lanes.
   Neimeyer said the victory also gave a big psychological boost to
the Royal Navy, which was stunned by the loss of the Hood.
   ``Tis gave confidence to the carrier-aviation community that they
could indeed sink a battleship,'' he said.
   The expedition was jointly funded by Turner Broadcasting System
Inc. and a group of private investors. The National Geographic
Society plans to produce a documentary on the discovery that will be
televised next fall.

   Underwater scientist Robert D. Ballard is
becoming host of ``National Geographic Explorer'' on SuperStation
TBS because he says the movie and television image of scientists is
driving young people away from science careers.
   ``We're going to change the show's emphasis to more live
exploration,'' said Ballard, the man who found the Titanic and the
Bismarck and recently led an expedition to a sunken Roman ship. That
effort was telecast live to several hundred thousand youngsters in
12 museums across the country.
   His discovery of the Nazi battleship Bismarck, resting upright in
15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of Brest, France, will be
shown in an October episode of the weekly ``Explorer'' series. The
fabled World War II ship was sunk in a battle with British naval
forces on May 27, 1941. Ballard found the ship June 8.
   ``I want to motivate children and show them that science is a
contact sport,'' said Ballard, who will become host in September.
``We've created an image that scientists are nerds. And that's
created a devastating effect on interest in science as a career.
   ``The battle for children's minds is between grades four to 12.
Right now 50 percent of all the students in American colleges
studying sciences are foreign students. We're now 17th in the world
in science literacy, behind Spain, Hungary and Ireland and
hopelessly behind Germany, Japan, England and the Scandinavian
countries.''
   He warned that if more American students don't become interested
in science the United States will slip economically, industrially
and militarily.
   ``The image children have of scientists is that of a harebrained,
forgetful wacko that they get from movies like `Back to the
Future,''' said Ballard. ``Children want to fit in with their peer
groups, they don't want to look like some silly guy.''
   Ballard is more in the mold of Indiana Jones. He has participated
in or led more than 60 deep-sea expeditions. He is a senior
scientist in the Ocean Engineering Department of the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, head of the Deep Submergence Laboratory
and director of the institution's Center for Marine Exploration.
   The 50,000-ton Bismarck was the biggest battleship launched by a
European power and was such a threat to the Allies that British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered an all-out effort to ``sink
the Bismarck.''
   The Bismarck sank the British battle cruiser Hood on May 24,
1941, but two days later British torpedo planes damaged the ship's
steering gear and rudders. The crucial battle came the next day.
   ``The Germans lost their main guns and control in the battle,''
said Ballard. ``The captain ordered the ship scuttled at 10 o'clock.
She was equipped with the latest in military technology and he
didn't want the ship captured. The ship was struck by more torpedoes
at 10:36 and sank three minutes later. Of 2,200 crewmen aboard the
Bismarck, only about 115 survived.
   ``The ship capsized and its gun turrets, which were held in place
by their weight, fell out. She landed upright and other than the
missing turrets and some superstructure damage she is in remarkable
condition. The Nazi swastikas are still visible on her deck.''
   The Bismarck was examined by the deep-sea robot Argo, which
Ballard also used to find the Titanic four years ago. The robot is
equipped with sonar, video cameras and still cameras. Pictures taken
by Argo, its tender and the mother ship on the surface will be used
in the ``Explorer'' program in October.
   The Jason Project in the Mediterranean Sea explored a 3rd Century
Roman ship and undersea volcanoes. Six one-hour shows of the
exploration were sent live by satellite to 12 museums in a two-week
period. Each museum had an exact replica of the control facilities
aboard the other ship so that the youngsters saw exactly what
Ballard saw only one-half second later.
   Future live television projects will take Ballard to the Great
Lakes to look for two ships sunk in the War of 1812, to Lake
Champlain to look for a gunboat sunk in the Revolutionary War, to
the Pacific off Okinawa to explore the Japanese battleship Yamata
and to the Pacific to examine the Japanese aircraft carriers that
attacked Pearl Harbor and were sunk in the Battle of Midway.
   ``We have a large program of exploration lined up and will have
the continued involvement of young people,'' Ballard said. ``We'll
take some children into the field, but most will participate by
telepresence. It will almost be like being there because they will
be surrounded by video pictures. On the Great Lakes project we will
have joy sticks in the museums that will let the youngsters actually
control the robot.''

FT  26 NOV 94 / Thinking the unsinkable: The modern parallels exposed by an
exhibition about the Titanic, which sank in 1912
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a grim coincidence that the first comprehensive exhibition of
artefacts recovered from the Titanic opened at the National Maritime Museum
in Greenwich a few days after the sinking of the ferry Estonia.
The fascination surrounding the loss of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic,
on its maiden voyage, was overshadowed by the shock of the sinking of a
modern ferry at a cost of more than 900 lives. The Titanic went down after
it struck an iceberg off Newfoundland on April 14, 1912. Only 705 of the
2,228 passengers and crew survived.
Timing apart, historians and naval experts see other parallels between the
two doomed vessels. Both were designed and built to prevailing standards but
both were found wanting.
The Titanic was launched when the number of lifeboats carried reflected the
cubic footage of the vessel devoted to passenger accommodation rather than
the number of passengers and crew. Its designers added a 12 per cent safety
margin to the minimum required by the Board of Trade but there were still
only enough lifeboats for half those on board.
A more comprehensive sub-division of the Titanic by internal bulkheads - a
design issue which is again being hotly debated after the Estonia sinking in
October - might have saved the liner, some experts think.
For 73 years the Titanic lay undisturbed, up to two miles down on the floor
of the Atlantic Ocean. The prospect of ever finding the vessel and answering
the unsolved mysteries of its sinking appeared remote.
But in 1985 the wreck was discovered by a joint French-US expedition.
RMS Titanic Inc, a New York-based company, was declared 'salvor in
possession', meaning that it had unique rights to explore the vessel and
raise material.
The company has since carried out three expeditions, the most recent in
July, using a submersible provided by the French Oceanographic Research
Institute. It has raised a total of 3,600 artefacts.
RMS Titanic is committed to raising material from the Titanic and putting it
on general display. It is pledged not to sell any of its finds.
Some 150 objects are on display at the maritime museum, include a ship's
porthole, metal deck bench ends and a letter from a manufacturer lamenting
the demise of the feather boa as a fashion accessory.
Video footage taken from the submersible shows the ship's rail, chandeliers
hanging in a long-abandoned state room and racks of plates.
The chance to stage the exhibition was offered to the maritime museum 'out
of the blue' by RMS, says Dr Eric Kentley, a curator.
There are no plans to take the exhibition to any other museums around the
world though the maritime museum and RMS are working on designs to establish
a permanent museum to display the material.
The Japanese meanwhile, have announced plans to build a full-scale replica
of the Titanic to act as a floating hotel and conference centre. All the
details of its interior would be replicated although there would be no
engines or steering gear.
As the Titanic sank into the darkness of the Atlantic it broke its back and
landed in two separate sections. When it hit the ocean floor the bow section
ploughed into the mud, obscuring to this day the details of how large a gash
was caused by the iceberg.
'The technology exists to remove the silt from the bow section but the
problem is to find the capital to get the equipment down there,' says John
Eaton, a historian with an interest in the Titanic going back more than 45
years.
Recovery of material has been limited to the sea around the vessel. A
decision to treat its interior as a grave site has meant that no attempt has
been made to raise artefacts from inside the hull. Although very few
survivors of the sinking are still alive 'people are very sensitive about
anyone going into the hull', comments Dr Kentley. Eaton confesses to finding
this ban 'very frustrating'.
Although the intense cold, the absence of light and low oxygen levels on the
ocean bed have slowed the deterioration of the Titanic, chemical attack and
sea-bed bacteria have eaten into the metal, staining many objects black.
A comparison of the photographs taken in 1986, and those from a descent in
1993, show a marked deterioration of the wreck, says Eaton. Dr Kentley
thinks there may be as little as 10 years left to continue work on the hull
before it disintegrates.
RMS and its backers are keen to raise more material from the wreck. However,
even if a sudden deterioration was to halt work, enough has been raised to
create a powerful reminder of the fate of the Titanic, and any other vessel
and its crew which underestimate the power of the sea. The exhibition, says
Dr Kentley: 'Is a timely reminder that the sea signs no treaties.'
The Wreck of the Titanic. Until April 2, 1995.

   Riding the waves, the Bismarck plowed across
the seas as the fiercest fighting ship in World War II. Collapsed
on the ocean floor, the German battleship looks cowed, a beaten
Nazi relic.
   The 1941 sinking of the Bismarck _ and this year's discovery of
its eerily well-preserved wreckage _ is the subject of ``National
Geographic Explorer,'' airing on cable's TBS on Oct. 29 at 9 p.m.
EST.
   The host of the one-hour special is Robert Ballard, the
oceanographer who previously discovered the remains of the Titanic.
The 1987 television account of the Titanic find still stands as
basic cable's most popular show.
   ``The Bismarck initially was just another hunt, just another
ship,'' Ballard said. ``But when I saw the faded remains of the
swastika on the ship's bow and stern, and a solitary seaman's boot
lying on the ocean floor, that symbolized to me the great tragedy
of World War II.''
   Ballard's Bismarck show will repeat Oct. 30 at midnight EST and
Nov. 4 at 8 a.m. EST. A videocassette of the program will be
released in December by National Geographic, whose November
magazine also details the Bismarck exploration.
   The Bismarck was the most formidable battleship of its era. In
its first tour of duty, the 820-foot floating fortress literally
blew Britain's prize battle cruiser Hood out of the water, killing
all but three of the Hood's 1,419-person crew.
   ``At the time, it was the most powerful ship on the sea,'' Peter
Schnall, co-producer of the Bismarck documentary, said of the
German warship. ``It threatened to stop basically all of the supply
ships that were coming in through the North Atlantic to England.''
   A terrorized Britain put every available warship into the
1,750-mile chase after the Bismarck. Prime Minister Winston
Churchill made his orders to his navy perfectly clear: ``Sink the
Bismarck!''
   Two days after destroying the Hood and racing for protection,
the Bismarck was crippled by a British torpedo-equipped biplane and
the country's carrier Ark Royal. The combined assault ruined the
Bismarck's steering gear and rudders.
   Functionally immobile, the warship was bombarded all night and
finally scuttled by the Germans. Only 115 of the Bismarck's 2,200
hands survived.
   ``The Germans put everything into'' the battleship, Schnall
said. ``But like everything, it had an Achilles heel. Knock out the
rudder and it's like a big ship with nowhere to go.''
   Ballard's finding the Bismarck required almost as much
determination and luck as did Britain's sinking it. With sonar and
video and still cameras whirring away, Ballard spent two summers
combing a 100-square mile area of the ocean's bottom 600 miles west
of Brest, France.
   ``Ballard's cabin was a couple of doors down from us,'' said
Schnall, who accompanied the oceanographer on the search. ``And all
of sudden one morning, we hear this incredible scream because
Ballard has a video monitor in his room. He had just woken up and
he saw it: just as (the underwater camera) was crossing the
midsection of the ship, right across the gun turrets.
   ``And he let out a whoop. That woke me up, we ran down and
grabbed our camera just as he was running out the door. ... It was
one of those rare moments in film when you catch something exactly
as it happens.''
   What Ballard's cameras found more than 15,000 feet below the
surface of the Atlantic startled the team.
   ``It looked like the ship had just been launched from its
original berth,'' Schnall said. ``It sat straight up on its
bottom.''
   There were no skeletons or human bones in sight.
   ``The exciting thing (about making the documentary) is that it
is almost like a natural story,'' Schnall said. ``You have the
Bismarck going out, you have the Bismarck eluding the British, and
then eventually being sunk.
   ``And we have an explorer (Ballard) who goes to find the
Bismarck, can't find it, has to regroup himself, and then go back
out again the next year and find it.''
   After the filmmakers collected footage of the Bismarck's
wreckage, they met with some of the men who once served on her
decks and showed them the underwater footage.
   ``Very slowly, they started to say, `Yes. Isn't that the gun
where I was standing?' Or, `Wasn't that the deck where so-and-so
was standing before it went down?'
   ``And on and on it went. Eventually, they saw the swastika on
the stern of the ship. ... One of the survivors, Heinrich Kuhnt,
was asked what it felt like to have survived this horrible sea
battle. And he hesitated. And slowly tears filled his eyes and he
couldn't stop crying.''

OCEANOGRAPHER BALLARD: HIS DISCOVERIES CONNECT SCIENCE WITH HISTORY 
</P>

<P>
Robert D. Ballard headed up the discovery of two fabled sunken ships, the 
Titanic in 1985 and, just last month, the World War II German battleship 
Bismarck. In both cases, poignant reminders of human frailty persist on the 
dark, cold ocean floor, he says, lingering testaments to the dead, dragged far 
beyond air and light by plummeting hulks of steel and iron. 
</P>
<P>
Shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Pairs and pairs of shoes resting on the sea floor as if their owners had just 
stepped out of them. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'What was it like to go to the Titanic, particularly out in the 
debris area, the stern section where everyone died?' " Ballard recalls of the 
ocean liner that sank to a depth of 12,000 feet in the North Atlantic in 1912, 
killing 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew. "There are pairs of shoes all 
over there where people actually came to rest on the bottom of the ocean. Their 
shoes are still there. Shoes all over the Bismarck, boots all over the place. 
Animals won't eat processed leather. They eat the body and the clothes but they 
won't eat the leather." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanographer Ballard, in Los Angeles to announce that he will host a 
television series about underwater explorations and other scientific ventures, 
is somewhere in the middle of a long explanation about why he pursues the 
sunken past with such avidity. Partly, he concedes, it's for the sensations 
that only discovery can provide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Moment of Discovery 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thrill of exploration is to see something, to be the first to set 
eyes on something that has never been seen before," he says. "The first time I 
saw the Titanic, wow! There it was, this monstrous ship just came out of the 
gloom and there it was." 
</P>
<P>
For Ballard, the moment of discovery is intellectually kinetic -- an instant 
when he connects palpably with history. "The best experience that I can give 
that's sort of an analogy is like going to Custer's Last Stand," he says. "To 
go and stand where Custer stood and imagine, you know, bad day to be in the 
cavalry. That's the sense, it's your hallowed grounds. You sense Crazy Horse 
there . . . and you just realize the hopelessness of the situation. Well, when 
you're out at the Titanic and all of a sudden it happened right here. It's no 
longer abstract." 
</P>
<P>
Unknown territory, scientific and historic, has been Ballard's country for more 
than two decades, perhaps even as far back as his childhood in Southern 
California, when he was smitten by accounts of African exploration and became 
captivated by the Pacific Ocean. Now, four years after the discovery of the 
Titanic catapulted him from mere well-known scientist to global fame, the 
47-year-old seems to be in the throes of another transformation. This time 
around he apparently is eager to shape both the future and the past with the 
technology that he developed in more than a decade of underwater exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he plans to use his new tools as the new host of National 
Geographic Explorer, a weekly two-hour program produced by National Geographic 
and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. It is the kind of popularizing of science 
that Ballard has been criticized for in the past by his peers. But Ballard says 
he sees his metamorphosis into TV personality as an educational mission that 
may help convince children that science is a "contact sport." 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the search for the Bismarck, Ballard obviously savors the contact 
with history and science. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Bismarck was engaged in a running battle hundreds of miles from 
land when it sank, neither the British nor the Germans were able -- or much 
interested -- in keeping precise records of their locations. So Ballard's 
expedition had to search about 150 square miles of ocean floor, initially with 
sonar and then with remote control, computerized robot sensors and cameras 
controlled from a surface ship before locating the wreck June 8. (This kind of 
exploration isn't cheap, Ballard notes, joking that "we had 100,000 pounds of 
equipment and 10 vans and six robots and a partridge in a pear tree.") 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand that the Bismarck battle was waged in a Force 8 sea -- 
50-knot winds, 15-foot waves -- (with) overcast and no celestial navigation," 
Ballard says. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the Bismarck -- which, like the Titanic, sank on its maiden 
voyage -- was further complicated by the nature of the Atlantic Ocean. The 
battleship was in "16,000 feet of water and it was in a mountain range," 
Ballard says, not without enthusiasm. "It was in an awful place and it was in 
the northern latitudes, up at 48 degrees North latitude, which is not a nice 
stretch of ocean -- ever, even in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, Ballard was drawn to the wreck because, like the 
Titanic, it is one of the most famous lost chunks of history to litter the 
ocean floor. "I do it because of the challenge to do it," he says. "But I'm 
also interested in the fact that this ship is well preserved. . . . There is 
probably more history preserved in the deep oceans of the world than in all the 
museums of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Although it has lost its gun turrets and was hit by numerous shells and 
torpedoes, the Bismarck still has touches of freshness, Ballard adds, citing 
the "huge painted swastikas" on the ship's bow and stern. 
</P>
<P>
In its day, the 50,000-ton Bismarck, with heavy armor, eight 15-inch guns 
capable of firing one-ton shells 24 miles and high-performance diesel engines, 
was one of the most powerful warships afloat. And briefly it proved to be just 
that. Slipping out of its home port of Danzig (now Gdynia) on May 18, 1941 to 
attack Allied convoys, the Bismarck soon had much of the British Royal Navy 
looking for it. At the time England faced a victorious Germany alone and was 
dependent on convoys from America for most of its food and war material. 
Discovered by two British heavy cruisers 
</P>
<P>
on May 23, the Bismarck was engaged the next day by two other British warships. 
From a distance of 25,000 yards, the Bismarck's huge shells hit the Hood, 
starting a fire in an ammunition locker. Within minutes the Hood exploded, 
killing all but three of the ship's 1,400 crew members. The Prince of Wales was 
also damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Bismarck, "the British were lucky to get it to the bottom," Ballard 
claims. In the climactic battle, a "freak hit" by a torpedo launched from a 
vintage World War I biplane knocked out the Bismarck's steering, forcing the 
crippled battleship to "wait for the British to come and get it." Of course, 
the British came and the Bismarck was sunk in the Atlantic about 600 miles west 
of France. 
</P>
<P>
Since the discovery of the Bismarck, Ballard says there has been curiosity 
about what actually caused the ship to sink -- British firepower or scuttling 
by her own crew. But Ballard believes the evidence makes the point moot. The 
British warships had orders to sink the Bismarck, not capture it, and the 
Germans were under orders not to let the pride of their fleet be taken as a war 
prize, he says. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m. on May 27, the captain of the Bismarck ordered his crew to open the 
seacocks on his disabled ship, thus flooding the hull, Ballard recounts. About 
10:30 a.m., the Bismarck was hit by three torpedoes from the British cruiser 
Dorsetshire and sank three minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bismarck's Survivors 
</P>
<P>
"So it was on its way down and the torpedoes helped -- but it was on its way 
down," Ballard says. "If they hadn't opened the seacocks, I'm convinced the 
British would have sat there and plunked torpedoes into it until it sank. So 
it's sort of academic who sank it." Only about 100 of the Bismarck's crew 
survived. Nearly 2,300 perished, including several hundred who were swimming in 
the water after their ship disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
It is that moment that seems to galvanize Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Bismarck sank, approximately 800 living souls went into the water and 
were alive after the ship went under," he says, leaning forward in his chair. 
"And the Dorsetshire came in and began picking up survivors and then someone 
thought they saw a periscope and they took off and they left 700 people in the 
water alive. . . . Can you imagine the awfulness, the hopelessness, the despair 
of the sailor who's just had a ship blown out from underneath him? He's 
paddling and freezing to death in this water and salvation is right there and 
he's grabbing hold of the hull and the ship takes off." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard has said he will not reveal the exact location of the Bismarck except 
to German authorities. As a ship of war, the battleship belongs to Germany, he 
says, although there might be some debate about which half of that divided 
country would have the more legitimate claim. 
</P>
<P>
As with the Titanic, Ballard says he strongly believes that such relatively 
recent wrecks should be left undisturbed, memorials to those who perished. As 
for wrecks from the dim reaches of the past, Ballard argues that they should be 
explored only by qualified archeologists intent on broadening historical 
knowledge. In fact, he still becomes visibly angry that private expeditions to 
the Titanic took some artifacts from the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developed Deep-Sea Robots 
</P>
<P>
But Ballard seems to be chiefly an enthusiast, not a critic. In particular he 
is a proponent of machines, especially robots. Ballard has headed up the 
development of a system of deep-sea unmanned robots -- called the Argo-Jason 
system. Equipped with cameras and other sensing devices, the robots are now 
capable of plumbing the world's deep waters faster and more safely than the 
tiny, slow, manned submarines that previously were the cutting edge of ocean 
research and exploration, he says. 
</P>
<P>
While an unmanned robot named Jason Jr. was used in a 1986 expedition to the 
Titanic, it was only within the last few months that the leap was made "to 
fully robotic exploration," Ballard says, meaning that robots can now be 
directed from a surface ship rather than from a manned submarine via a control 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
It's a relief that he and others won't have to spend five or more hours per day 
"commuting" to the ocean floor, which averages 12,000 feet in depth, he says. 
Even though he has spent a lot of time in cramped research submarines and 
probably will spend more, Ballard is miffed by the inefficiency of the 
"romantic little guys," referring to the small submarines. 
</P>
<P>
He explains: ". . . you're spending five hours a day freezing to death in this 
little sphere. Our average dive time on the Titanic was three hours a day. 
Three hours out of 24 and you've got 50 people and you've got one guy looking 
out of a window." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Interest in Science 
</P>
<P>
Ballard has been talking about the potential of this technology for years. But 
recent advances have made him more convinced than ever that the concept of 
"telepresence" will revolutionize not only undersea exploration but the way 
many people "travel." More important, he sees the technology as capable of 
rekindling interest in science among American schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now reaching a point in technology, in imaging devices both acoustic and 
visual, fiber optic transmission links, digital enhancement, computer 
manipulation, robotics etc, etc. to simulate presence," he says in a gee-whiz 
way. "In fact many of us in the technology believe it will become a pervasive 
way of people living their lives. In other words, ultimately you won't travel 
that much. You'll travel in a telepresence way. We can have this conversation 
half a world apart and you'll sense my presence, I'll sense yours. . . . The 
idea of the Argo-Jason system is to put you in a room and convince you you're 
in a submarine looking out a bunch of windows" that are in fact video monitors 
displaying scenes picked up by robot-mounted cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard, whose professional base is the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on 
Massachusetts' Cape Cod, is such a believer in the concept of telepresence that 
he's already using it to change the way he lives. He recently built a house 
near Montana's Glacier National Park in which he is installing a satellite 
antenna so that he can bounce his image and voice into space and back to Earth 
for professional meetings and conversations with people far, far away. His goal 
is "to create a place where I don't feel professionally inconvenienced by 
living in Montana." 
</P>
<P>
How much time he actually will spend in northern Montana is an open question, 
though, given the demands of the Explorer television series. 
</P>
<P>
With the series, including a program on the Bismarck to be broadcast in late 
October, Ballard asserts that he can do his bit to instill a respect for the 
past and take millions on magical mystery tours of the kingdoms under the sea. 
</P>
<P>
". . . 70% of the planet's under water. We've seen less than .1% of 1%. I mean 
we know more about the mountain ranges on Mars than the mountain ranges of our 
own planet," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Vast Unknown 
</P>
<P>
It is this sense of the vast unknown here on Earth that he wants to 
communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"To me the concept of an explorer has been somewhat diminished," he says. 
"People now retrace Hannibal's route in a Winnebago or they walk backwards to 
the North Pole. It's sort of become a Guinness Book of World Records type of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
And he says he wants to do his part to protect good old people-friendly dry 
land too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important right now to realize that the Earth is in jeopardy and 
we're the first generation that can kill it and we're killing it," he says, 
leaving the battles of World War II far behind. ". . . This baloney about 
living in space is baloney. You send everyone else out there and give me 
Montana. I have no desire to live underwater. I've seen the place."

FT  04 APR 92 / The Titanic's tales of terror: Alexander Garrett on a famous
maritime disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER GARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE afternoon of the April 15 1912, Bruce Ismay, managing director of the
White Star Line, filled out a Marconi telegram form for company headquarters
in New York. 'Deeply regret to advise you Titanic sank this morning 15th
after collision iceberg resulting serious loss life,' he wrote. 'Further
particulars later.'
Ismay was aboard the rescue ship Carpathia, one of 705 survivors - 1,516
perished. But his message remained unsent until 5.50 am on the 17th, nearly
two days later. The wireless telegraph was Carpathia's only contact with the
world, and as its operator worked round the clock to send out messages from
survivors, the signal from the White Star managing director - confirming
what the world already feared - was overlooked.
Today, a vessel involved in a collision would be in contact with coastguard
authorities within seconds. Then, the delay caused enormous uncertainty,
provoked accusations of censorship, and added one more mystery to the
intrigue surrounding the disaster.
On Tuesday April 14, Ismay's communique is one of 448 radio signal messages
relating to the Titanic to be sold at Christie's in South Kensington,
London. Together they provide a poignant chronicle of events in the world's
most famous maritime disaster, 80 years ago this week. The collection is
being sold by John Booth, who has exhibited them at the Titanic Signals
Archive for the last three years.
That these signals survived is remarkable. At the time the Titanic went
down, telegraph companies kept originals of all transmitted signals for 12
months. Messages from ships involved in the Titanic disaster were assembled
for the two public inquiries, one in the US, the other in London. After
that, they were returned to the Marconi company where they were held in a
vault until the late 1940s.
When Cable and Wireless took over the Eastern Telegraph Company - as it had
by then become - the signals were earmarked for destruction, but they were
salvaged by an unnamed employee, whose son found them hidden in a suitcase
when his father died 30 years later. Booth later acquired the signals. He is
selling them now, he says, 'because my wife says they take up too much of my
time'.
Before the wireless was invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1896, ships
communicated with each other by flags and light signals.
But when the Titanic set sail from Southampton on Wednesday April 10 1912,
she had the most powerful wireless yet fitted. She was one of the first
liners to have two wireless operators - John Phillips and Harold Bride, both
employed by Marconi - who could together provide a round-the-clock radio
watch.
Early in the voyage, they were busy telegraphing arrangements for passengers
to meet relatives in New York. It was a lucrative business for Marconi: each
message cost 30 shillings, at a time when the second wireless operator
earned 50 shillings a month.
It is the tone of optimism that is striking. One starts: 'Fine voyage fine
ship feeling fine'. Another: 'Hardly wait to get back. Cable made me awfully
happy. Love Mutzie'
One, however, was more ominous. 'Westbound steamers report bergs growlers
and field ice in 42 N from 49 to 51 West. April 12th Compts Barr'
On April 12, the Touraine radioed to report 'dense fog and thick icefields'.
Further danger signals followed from the Californian and the Caronia. One of
the great unresolved questions of the disaster is why the Titanic's captain
continued to sail towards the danger zone at 22 knots, especially as Harold
Bride, the Titanic's surviving wireless operator, told the US inquiry that
he had passed on the message from the Californian, and it had been
'personally acknowledged' by Captain Smith.
Later that day a fateful message was sent: 'Sinking wants immediate
assistance'.
The shortcomings of the wireless - as then operated - become evident
immediately following the collision with the iceberg. Unlike the Titanic,
most of the ships that night had only one radio man, if any.
Thomas Cottam, sole operator on the Carpathia, should have finished duty at
midnight. At 12.30 he was about to retire when the first distress signal
came through. The Carpathia sailed to the Titanic's aid at full speed, but
it was 60 miles away, three and a half hours sailing. Another ship, the
Californian, was (by its own controversial account) only 19 miles away, but
its wireless operator, Cyril Evans, had gone to bed. A third vessel, the
Norwegian trawler Samson, may have been even closer, but had no radio.
Marconi was later asked why his apparatus did not have a bell to wake the
operator. He replied: 'On the old equipment used by ships there was a bell
arrangement, which did not work well because it alarmed the operators of all
ships, as well as the one called.'
'Titanic struck iceberg sunk Monday 3 am. Carpathia picked up many
passengers am proceeding New York. Captain Rostron.'
The signals flying through the airwaves created total confusion for the
press. In New York, The Evening Sun trumpeted 'All saved from Titanic after
collision.' The following morning in London, the account in The Times was
riddled with contradiction. After reporting that the Titanic had sunk with
'great loss of life,' it cited later that she was being towed by The
Virginian to Halifax, or was heading under her own steam to New York.
By the following day, April 17, the full extent of the tragedy had become
clear and the recriminations began. The Times scolded the Central News
Agency over a phantom wireless message which had reported everybody safe;
while questions were asked about signals being 'interfered' with by 'amateur
operators'.
An explanation for one of the 'phantom' signals later materialised. A radio
ham unwittingly merged two signals, one asking 'Are all Titanic passengers
safe?' and another from the Asian announcing she was towing the German
tanker Deutschland to Halifax. The result: 'Titanic passengers safe being
towed to Halifax.'
Before the Titanic went down, its two radio operators were given permission
to leave their posts. Bride was washed overboard, but was picked up by the
Carpathia. As the Carpathia headed back to New York, he assisted Cottam in
sending messages from survivors. A few remained cheerful, as: 'Meet me dock
with two hundred dollars underwear cap big coat. Am well but feet slightly
frozen answer George.' Others were tragic: 'Mother girls safe father Charlie
missing'. 'Father not seen no hope arrive Carpathia Wednesday New York.
Richard.'
The US inquiry made a number of recommendations about the use of
radiotelegraphy on ships. But although the Titanic sinking had highlighted
its shortcomings, the momentous significance of radio communication for
sea-going vessels was elegiacally summed up in a Times editorial on April
16:
'But for wireless telegraphy, the disaster might have assumed proportions
which at present we cannot measure; and we should have known nothing of its
occurence for an indefinite period . . . The advantages conferred by this
abridgment of space are enormous. No vessel need be alone, none need vanish
without a sign from human ken; and in none but crushing and instant
disasters need any despair of help.'

<TEXT>
   The crew that discovered the
wreck of the Titanic used a robot diver Monday to explore a War of
1812-era wreck in Lake Ontario _ and shared the expedition with
children across North America.
   The camera-equipped robot examined the Hamilton, a merchant
schooner that the British pressed into service as a warship.
   Students at 14 spots in the United States and Canada watched
satellite TV transmissions. A few students even got to try steering
the robot through a satellite link, using joysticks like those used
with computer games. It transmitted pictures to students watching
through satellite hookups at 14 locations in the United States and
Canada.
   Cannons, railings and the ship's elegantly carved figurehead
could be seen in the television transmission.
   Robert D. Ballard, the expedition's leader, said the ship's
state of preservation was remarkable.
   ``We can see the caulking in the planks,'' he said.
   The Hamilton and its sister ship, the Scourge, sank during a
storm on Aug. 8, 1813, killing 53 sailors. They had taken part in
several battles for the British against U.S. forces that invaded
southern Canada during the war.
   The wrecks remained undisturbed in 300 feet of water six miles
off St. Catharines, about 30 miles south of Toronto and less than
10 miles west of the U.S. border at Niagara Falls, until their
discovery in 1975.
   Since then, there have been several attempts to examine the
wrecks, including one by French explorer Jacques Cousteau. But none
were technologically advanced enough to reach them.
   The cold, fresh water helped keep the ships in much better
condition than most wrecks, said Shelley Lauzon, a project
spokeswoman.
   ``The wood on the Titanic is all gone because there are
wood-boring animals in salt water,'' Lauzon said. ``They're not
present here.''
   Ballard, director of the Center for Marine Exploration at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, led the 1985
expedition that discovered the wreck of the Titanic. The ocean
liner sank in the North Atlantic after ramming an iceberg in 1912.
   Ballard said Monday's examination of the Hamilton and the
Scourge was aimed more at teaching children about archaeology and
oceanography than at making startling new discoveries about the two
warships.
   ``We've had four students actually take control and operate the
vehicle beautifully,'' he said in an interview by ship-to-shore
telephone. ``That was the biggest technological feat.''
   The children controlled the robot with a joystick linked to the
system by satellite, Lauzon said. A computer program restricted the
robot's movements so the children could not damage it.
   Although there were no archaeological breakthroughs, the
expedition did reveal a number of details not known before, Ballard
said.
   The two-week expedition will prepare a comprehensive diagram of
both ships and could provide information allowing the city of
Hamilton, which has title to the wrecks, to decide whether they are
worth raising. Ballard said there appeared to be little damage that
would stand in the way of such an effort.
   ``There's no suggestion that they suffered any damage due to the
sinking itself,'' he said. ``They just got flooded and went down
very gently.''
   The museums taking part in the program were in Boston; Chicago;
Dallas; Detroit; Memphis, Tenn.; Minneapolis; Rochester, N.Y.; Salt
Lake City; Sarasota, Fla.; Toronto; Victoria, British Columbia;
Washington; and Woods Hole.

<HEAD>Titanic Inquiry after 78 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inquiry will be held into the conduct of a
steamship captain who was criticized for not coming to the aid of
the Titanic when it sank 78 years ago, the government said Monday.
   The Titanic sank after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic
on April 14, 1912. More than 1,500 of the 2,200 people aboard the
ship perished.
   The Marine Accident Investigation Branch will examine testimony
at the 1912 inquiry into the loss of the great liner to throw light
on the role of the late Capt. Stanley Lord, said a Department of
Transport spokeswoman.
   The inquiry comes in response to a campaign by Lord's relatives,
who have been trying to clear his name, said the spokeswoman. She
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The inquiry was first reported in Monday's editions of The Daily
Telegraph, which said a crucial piece of evidence would be the
position of the wreck as determined in 1985 by U.S. oceanographer
Robert Ballard.
   Lord was master of the Boston-bound Californian, believed to
have been the ship nearest to the Titanic when it struck the
iceberg.
   The Carpathia and other ships which were farther away than the
Californian did reach the scene in answer to the stricken liner's
distress calls.
   Lord's ship was stopped by ice at the time. The original inquiry
censured him for not responding to distress rockets from the
Titanic and ruled that as he was 8 to 10 miles from the liner he
could have gone to its aid and saved lives.
   Lord died in 1962, claiming to the end that the Titanic was in
an icefield 20 miles or more from his ship and that he was unable
to help. A campaign to clear his name has been carried on by his
son and other supporters, and an earlier petition to reopen the
inquiry was rejected in 1965.
   Lord insisted that a ship seen from the Californian was not the
Titanic. The ship was only identified in 1962 as the Samson, a
seal-hunter.
   ``Supporters of Capt. Lord claimed he was a scapegoat for the
failire of the Titanic's owners and the Board of Trade to make sure
there were enough lifeboats,'' The Daily Telegraph said.
   It quoted Capt. James de Coverley, deputy chief of marine
accidents, as saying the 1912 inquiry would not be reopened as that
had been into the Titanic's loss, not Lord's conduct.
   ``We are not in the business of rewriting history but in this
particular case it was considered desirable to have a
re-evaluation,'' de Coverley was quoted as saying.

   Titanic Wired `Shut Up'
   In Reply to Warning

<LP>
   In regard to your Feb. 21 page-one article about the new
investigation into the Titanic disaster: I wrote a
college-term paper on the subject 37 years ago. According to
my research then, Capt. Stanley Lord ordered his wireless
operator to contact the Titanic and advise it that he had
stopped his ship, the Californian, because of the iceberg
conditions. He was told by the Titanic's operator to "shut
up" because his current was interfering with its outgoing
commercial messages.
   In 1912, Marconi wireless operators did not maintain a
24-hour watch aboard transAtlantic vessels -- so, at 11:30
p.m., the Californian's operator removed his earphones and
went to bed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At 11:40 p.m., the Titanic struck the iceberg and shortly
thereafter began to fire off its white distress flares. Capt.
Lord, when informed of this, noted that it was probably just
the Titanic's passengers celebrating the maiden voyage of the
new luxury liner. He ordered his crew to attempt to
communicate with the Titanic by Morse light and returned to
his bed. Capt. Lord's men continued signaling with the light
until 1:30 a.m., but got no response from the Titanic. It has
been suggested that the Titanic's officers and crew were far
too busy loading their passengers onto lifeboats to have seen
the Californian's flashing signals. Several surviving
passengers later recalled seeing the lights, and some of them
said they rowed their lifeboats toward them.
   Following the investigations on both sides of the Atlantic
into the Titanic sinking, steamship companies were required
to keep a radio operator on duty round the clock.

<HEAD>New Ship Communications Signal End Of Morse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World shipping leaders have given the go-ahead for
the introduction of new, automatic communications that will mean the
end of the Morse code for ships at sea.
   The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System transmits and
receives automatically, so Morse will no longer be a requirement for
ships. Shipowners are expected to phase out radio operators when the
new equipment is installed in ships, starting in 1993.
   Some parts of the new technology, which includes satellite
communications, are already in use on British ships and from 1999
they will be compulsory on ships worldwide.
   The decision was taken Friday during a two-week London conference
of the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency
for the safety of shipping and preventing ships polluting the seas.
   The 66 countries represented accounted for about 97 percent of
the world's ships, said spokesman Roger Kohn.
   A statement afterward called the decision ``one of the biggest
advances in maritime communications since the introduction of
radio.''
   The new system allows the crew to send a distress signal by
pushing a button, which should prevent ships disappearing without a
trace when messages cannot be sent in time.
   Ships will also carry a radio beacon, which will give the ship's
position and must be able to float free if the ship sinks suddenly.
   Kohn said: ``Morse has great romantic connotations with the
gallant radio operator sending off distress calls as the ship sinks.
But we are bringing in something that will be much better and which
should save even more lives.''
   The Morse code, invented by American Samuel Morse and first used
in 1844, has been the foundation of ship's distress and safety
messages since the turn of the century. It is a series of long and
short electronic ``dots and dashes'' representing letters of the
alphabet.
   Morse code was used to inform an incredulous world that the
supposedly unsinkable oceanliner Titanic was sinking in the North
Atlantic in 1912. The Titanic sank swiftly and 1,500 people perished.

   Seaman Adolf Eich crawled through a
narrow tunnel inside the burning battleship Bismarck, scrambling for
his life as British forces bombarded the Third Reich's most dreaded
fighting vessel.
   Eich, a survivor of one of the most famous battles in naval
history, recounted his tale Wednesday after American explorers found
the sunken battleship under 2.8 miles of water 600 miles off the
coast of France.
   The Bismarck went down on May 27, 1941, ending a furious pursuit
by British warships and aircraft defending the Allies' crucial
supply lines with Europe.
   Of 2,200 Bismarck crewmembers, only about 100 survived.
   ``The water was red from blood, and I could see at least 500
people swimming in the sea. Most of them didn't make it,'' said
Eich, who was pulled from the cold North Atlantic by British naval
forces.
   The U.S. oceanographer who found the Bismarck on Monday, Robert
Ballard, said the ship would remain in its resting place as an
``undersea memorial.''
   Ballard, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
Massachusetts, said the wreckage of one of the epic naval battles of
World War II was ``still rather a beautiful ship.''
   British naval historians hailed it as a major discovery.
   The heavily armed, iron-clad vessel demonstrated its killing
power on May 24, 1941, when it sank the famed British battle cruiser
Hood off the coast of Greenland. Only three of the 1,425 sailors
aboard survived.
   British forces, ordered to sink the Bismarck at any cost, finally
caught up with it off France on May 26, launching a furious attack
with heavy naval guns and air-launched torpedoes that crippled the
largest ship in Adolf Hitler's navy.
   Eich, then 20, said he was in a below-decks fire-control room
when the order finally came to abandon ship on May 27.
   ``There was rubble all over the place, and there was no safe way
of getting out,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in
Duesseldorf.
   The retired telex operator said he and another sailor, Halke
Franz, managed to crawl out through a narrow, circular passage for
electrical cables.
   Eich said he was astonished by the carnage and destruction he
found on deck.
   ``When I came out I couldn't believe there was anyone still
alive,'' he said.
   Survivors Hermann Budich, 69, and Paul Rudek, 72, also have vivid
memories of the battle.
   ``I lost a lot of friends on that ship, some of whom I knew for
two years,'' said Budich, of the northern town of Bad Segeberg.
   Rudek said he was impressed by the ship's thick armored plates
when he was assigned to the vessel as a petty officer.
   ``At that time I thought nothing could ever happen to this
ship,'' said Rudek, of the northern port city Kiel.
   He said that on May 26 British aircraft began pounding the
Bismarck with torpedoes and knocked out one of the ship's rudders so
that it could only maneuver in circles.
   In the early hours of May 27, the Bismarck's commanders ordered
destroyed so that it would not be seized by the British.
   ``And then we knew the end was near,'' Rudek said.
   Explosives were set off near the ship's drainage ports and the
Bismarck flopped over.
   Rudek slid into the water from the starboard side. He tried
desperately to grab a rescue line thrown by crewmen from the British
warship Dorsetshire, but it was just out of reach. Then a wave
shoved him closer and he was able to grab the line.
   Rudek said it still horrifies him to think of his comrades who
drowned sealed inside the Bismarck.
   ``I was lucky that I went over the rail,'' said Rudek, who like
the other survivors spent the rest of the war in British prisoner of
war camps.
   The sinking of the Hood, the pride of the British nay, was a
tremendous blow to British morale.
   But Eich said many Bismarck crew members formed lasting
friendships with their former enemies and that they communicate
frequently.
   Ted Briggs, one of three Hood survivors, was asked by the AP
London bureau whether he felt any bitterness.
   ``At first, yes,'' said the retired real estate agent and former
Hood signalman.
   ``But when you come to think of it, they were doing their job
just as we were doing ours. But the memory is with me all the time.''

<HEAD>Titanic Memorabilia Auctioned On 76th Anniversary Of Sinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A postcard mailed from the Titanic fetched $2,068
during an auction Friday, the 76th anniversary of the ocean liner's
sinking, but a water-stained letter found on the body of a dead
passenger went unsold.
   The auction of 200 items of Titanic memorabilia raised $56,400,
Onslow's Auctioneers reported.
   A spokesman said the water-stained letter didn't sell because it
may have been considered too ghoulish.
   One collector paid $2,068 for the postcard stamped on the ship
and posted when it stopped in Ireland.
   Northern Ireland's Ulster Folk and Transport Museum paid the
auction's top price of $14,100 for a 1912 watercolor painting
entitled ``Fitting Out The Titanic, Belfast.''
   The Titanic, built in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and declared
unsinkable, went down in the Atlantic on April 15, 1912, after
hitting an iceberg while on its maiden voyage from Southampton,
England, to New York. A total of 1,513 people perished.
   The wreck of the liner about 2.5 miles below the surface and 350
miles south of Newfoundland was first located by a U.S.-French
expedition in September 1985.

   It was news that the world had waited seven decades to hear. 
On Sept. 1, 1985, Robert D. Ballard announced that he had found and photographed the wreck of the Royal Mail Steamship Titanic, the largest and most luxurious liner that had ever plied the seas. 

   Mr. Ballard had triumphed -- where many before him had failed -- through a combination of determination, detective work and a firm commitment to advanced technology. 
In that first expedition and in a follow-up a year later, he and his scientific crew shot thousands of still photos and made hours of videotape of the Titanic's final resting place. 

   Now comes "The Discovery of the Titanic" (Madison Press/Warner Books, 230 pages, $29.95), Mr. Ballard's lavishly illustrated account of how the ship was located and what was found when it was. 
One needn't be a Titanic buff to be bowled over by the result. 

   The loss of the Titanic was one of those events that defined an era. 
Hailed as "unsinkable" (though not by either its builders or owners), it was speeding through the night on its maiden voyage when it struck an iceberg on April 14, 1912. 
It carried lifeboats for only a fraction of the 2,227 on board, and when it plunged 2 1/2 miles to the bottom of the frigid Atlantic it took more than 1,500 people with it. 

   For 73 years, the wreck had eluded all searchers. 
Enter Mr. Ballard, a geologist and self-described "submarine cowboy" working out of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts. 
His previous deep ocean work in the Galapagos Rift and Eastern Pacific Rise had already gained him a measure of renown. 
Throughout those explorations, however, the lure of finding the Titanic remained, and each advance in oceanographic technology brought the dream tantalizingly closer. 

   Finally, in 1985, a joint U.S.-French team set out using some of the highest of high-technology equipment, including an underwater television camera capable of scanning the ocean's bottom. 
Mr. Ballard hoped to prove that video exploration of the oceans was both feasible and preferable to using manned submersibles. 
Yet the task was formidable -- far more difficult than finding the proverbial needle in the haystack. 
The explorers found the wreck on almost the very edge of the expanse of water they had identified as their primary search area. 

   The discovery, when it came, was a tremendous scientific achievement, but it also was a human one. 
Mr. Ballard writes of his emotions while standing on the deck of his ship at the exact hour and over the exact spot of the Titanic's demise: "It was one thing to have won -- to have found the ship. 
It was another thing to be there. 
That was the spooky part. 
I could see the Titanic as she slipped nose first into the glassy water. 
Around me were the ghostly shapes of the lifeboats and the piercing shouts and screams of people freezing to death in the water." 

   "The Discovery of the Titanic" is no idealized version of events. 
Mr. Ballard documents tensions within the crew over the approach to the search, as well as the rupture between the U.S. and French scientific teams after the discovery, when the French felt they were being deprived of their share of the glory of discovery. 
Mr. Ballard's own conceits -- some even bordering on arrogance -- come through as well. 
His insistence that electronic rather than human exploration is the wave of the future brought him into conflict with the group manning Alvin, the famous miniature submarine. 
Yet even this champion of new technology could not resist the desire to see the wreck through his own eyes: When he returned to the Titanic a year later, it was with Alvin -- allowing him physically to land on the deck of the Titanic and, using a swimming robot camera, explore the interior reaches of the wreck. 

   In any event, the book itself is splendid visual testament to Mr. Ballard's approach. 
The underwater photographs are stunning in both their clarity and their poignance: the empty davits that launched the too-few lifeboats; a doll's head lying incongruously on the ocean floor; a pair of shoes perfectly preserved long after the disappearance of any trace of the body that once wore them. 
Hundreds of color pictures of the rusting hulk -- often matched with vintage photos of how the ship looked in its heyday -- give eloquent testimony to its fate. 
Equally absorbing are paintings of what the entire hulk must look like now, by artist Ken Marschall. 

   The location and visual inspection of the wreck also cast new light on some of the mysteries surrounding the ship. 
It indeed broke in two before its final descent, as a few of the survivors claimed. 
The explorers found no evidence of the continuous gash many thought had been ripped in the hull; the evidence instead supports the notion that the collision caused the ship's steel plating to rupture intermittently. 
And the ship's location indicates it was not traveling quite as fast as was long believed -- though it was still moving much too quickly. 

   Many people might have thought that the Titanic should remain undiscovered. 
As with watching a magic trick, some of the wreck's fascination has always been rooted in mystery; know too much and the thrill is spoiled. 
It is a tribute to Mr. Ballard, and to this absorbing book, that he manages to preserve the fascination with the Titanic even while stripping away a significant amount of the mystery around its fate.

   Scientists using a robot diver to
explore two War of 1812-era wrecks let schoolchildren across North
America in on the expedition.
   The underwater look Monday at the merchant schooner Hamilton and
its sister ship, the Scourge, was televised live to 13 museums.
Four youngsters watching got to operate the robot using a computer
joystick hooked up by satellite.
   The cold, fresh water of Lake Ontario and the 300-foot depth of
the wrecks helped preserve the two ships, which were pressed into
battle service by the United States during the War of 1812.
   Cannons, railings and an elegantly carved figurehead could be
seen as the black-and-white television image panned slowly.
   Robert D. Ballard, the expedition's leader, and other scientists
gave a running narration and took questions from viewers at the
museums in the United States and Canada and at the Canadian
Football Hall of Fame in Hamilton, a city 25 miles west of St.
Catharines that has title to the wrecks.
   ``The ship is in immaculate condition. We can see the caulking
in the planks,'' Ballard said. ``There's no suggestion that they
suffered any damage due to the sinking itself. They just got
flooded and went down very gently.''
   The Hamilton and the Scourge sank during a storm Aug. 8, 1813,
killing 53 sailors. They had taken part in several battles against
British forces in southern Canada.
   However, the wrecks narrowly escaped damage from large ships
that dragged their anchors across the lake bottom, Ballard said. He
said the furrows caused by the anchors were plainly visible near
the wrecks.
   The wrecks remained undisturbed six miles off St. Catharines, 30
miles south of Toronto on the lake's southern shore, until their
discovery in 1975. Since then, scientists such as French underwater
explorer Jacques Cousteau have used submarines and remote cameras
to explore them, but Ballard's expedition was the most
technologically sophisticated yet.
   In an interview by ship-to-shore telephone, Ballard said the
children's participation was the most significant part of the
program. He said the remote control setup had never been used
before.
   Ballard said the two-week expedition would produce a detailed
map of the wrecks that Hamilton officials could use in deciding
whether to raise them someday.
   Ballard, director of the Center for Marine Exploration at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, led the 1985
expedition that discovered the wreck of the Titanic. The storied
ocean liner sank in the North Atlantic after ramming an iceberg in
1912.
   The museums taking part in the program were in Boston; Chicago;
Dallas; Detroit; Memphis, Tenn.; Minneapolis; Rochester, N.Y.; Salt
Lake City; Sarasota, Fla.; Toronto; Victoria, British Columbia;
Washington; and Woods Hole, Mass.

   On the cold, clear night in 1912 that the RMS Titanic
struck ice and sank into history, a heinous crime occurred.
   As the icy Atlantic gushed in through the great liner's
hull, passengers and crew spied a flicker of hope. On the
horizon, the lights of another ship appeared. They signaled
to it, firing rockets high into the sky. But the ship didn't
respond. In fact, "it seemed as if the vessel was turning
around and leaving us," a survivor recalled.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The mystery ship steamed off, abandoning about 1,500
people to drown in the chill black sea; 705 survived.
   Thus began one of maritime history's great whodunits --
and one that has suddenly inspired new investigations in
Liverpool, England. What ship was it? And why, as a U.S.
Senate committee of the day put it, did it disregard "the
dictates of humanity, international usage, and the
requirements of law?" Armed with new evidence, the British
government has reopened its Titanic files and named a special
examiner to plumb this 79-year-old mystery. "This is a unique
investigation," says a government spokesman.
   At issue is the guilt or innocence of Stanley Lord, the
English sea captain whose cargo ship, the S.S. Californian,
was accused of being the mystery vessel. Capt. Lord was
napping in his chartroom that fateful night, while junior
officers were said to have dithered on the bridge. He denied
it, but went to his grave in 1962 portrayed as the monster
who slept while hundreds drowned.
   "Reprehensible and un-British," was how one London
magazine damned his conduct. His supporters, on the other
hand, view him as a scapegoat. They say he was blamed to
divert public outrage from the real reason so many died that
night: lax safety regulations that enabled the Titanic to
scrimp on lifeboats.
   Indeed, Capt. Lord's culpability is again being
challenged, and he may soon have his reputation restored. If
the British examiner exonerates him, a parallel campaign
could gather steam in Washington to correct the record there.
The grand aim, says Leslie Harrison, the captain's former
union leader and chief defender, is to correct "the grossest
miscarriage of justice" in British seafaring history.
   The prospect has the small world of Titanic scholarship in
a maelstrom. For 30 years, a tiny -- and now very aged --
crew of British and U.S. history buffs has debated the late
captain's case. Like a schismatic church, they are split into
Lordites and anti-Lordites. The Lordites say the Californian
wasn't the mystery vessel. Bilge, say the anti-Lordites. The
two sides trade jibes in such journals as "The Titanic
Commutator," a quarterly publication of the U.S.-based
Titanic Historical Society.
   "Passions are high. I have spent more time working on this
one issue than any other" about the Titanic, says Walter
Lord, author of the 1950s best-seller about the sinking, "A
Night to Remember." Confusingly, Mr. Lord, now 73, is an
anti-Lordite. He is also "no relation of ours, thank
goodness," says Stanley T. Lord, who is a Lordite and the
captain's 83-year-old son.
   Steering the course for the Lordite faction is Mr.
Harrison, who has been Capt. Lord's tireless defender since
1958. That year, Mr. Harrison recalls, a tall, elderly
captain appeared in his Liverpool office one day and declared
with authority: "I'm Lord of the Californian." The name meant
nothing to Mr. Harrison, then a clerkish young idealist who
had spent much of his own brief sea career leaning greenly
over the rail. But the captain explained: A new British
movie, "A Night to Remember," based on the book, was
dramatizing the charges against him and he wanted his union's
help to defend his name.
   Since then, muses the now-elderly union leader -- he is 78
and retired to a cottage overlooking the sea -- "my life has
been one of constant battles with people."
   In trying to prove the captain's innocence, Mr. Harrison
scoured musty archives, tape-recorded hours of conversation
with the captain and took affidavits from Titanic witnesses.
He badgered British politicians for a rehearing. To publicize
the case, he spent four years writing a book on it -- and 10
years trying to get it published. When it finally appeared in
1986, it sold 1,720 copies. He even quarreled with his own
union colleagues, some of whom urged him to drop the case as
hopeless.
   He refused. "My approach to life is scrupulous honesty,"
Mr. Harrison says, struggling to explain his persistence. "So
long as there's this absolutely gross slander on his name,
I've got to do what I told him I'd do: Not drop the case."
   According to Mr. Harrison's book, "A Titanic Myth: The
Californian Incident," Capt. Lord had prudently stopped his
ship that night in mid-Atlantic upon encountering a vast ice
field -- the same field into which the Titanic was then
heedlessly steaming. On the horizon, he spied a ship that he
took to be a tramp steamer, but which a junior officer
thought resembled an ocean liner. Capt. Lord signaled to it,
but it didn't respond. So with everything quiet, he left the
bridge after midnight for a four-hour nap on the chartroom
settee.
   As the mariner slumbered, the sea brought strange sights.
"I observed a flash of light in the sky," the officer on
watch said later. It was a white rocket -- possibly a
distress signal -- and it rose near the unidentified vessel.
Seven more rockets followed. After conferring by speaker-tube
with the sleepy captain, the bridge tried signaling the ship
again; still it didn't respond. Then it disappeared --
steamed away, the officer on watch said; sank, U.S. and
British inquests said.
   The next morning, the Californian's wireless operator
learned of the Titanic's sinking from other passing ships.
"Where have you been all night?" one ship asked. "Been
asleep?"
   The questions came to torment Capt. Lord. After landing at
Boston, his ship was named by a U.S. Senate committee and by
a British inquest as being the vessel seen from the Titanic.
Cowardice was the crime: He and his officers were accused of
ignoring the distress rockets in order to avoid a risky
nighttime rescue through an ice field. Capt. Lord denied
this; but he was disgraced -- a scapegoat, Lordites say,
referring to the alleged cover-up of the Titanic's lack of
lifeboats.
   "They wanted to find somebody to blame, and they pounced
on father," says his son.
   Even so, Capt. Lord continued to get commands, thanks to
his reputation among shipowners as a skillfull and safe
captain.
   The chief Lordite theory is that -- far from seeing each
other that night -- the Californian and Titanic were watching
a third, unidentified vessel steaming between them. One
suspect is a seal ship called the Samson, said to have been
hunting illegally in the area. It supposedly mistook the
Titanic's lights and rockets for a U.S. Coast Guard patrol
and fled. But anti-Lordites contend there is little evidence
to support that -- and even if there was a third ship, the
Californian's officers were still negligent in failing to
investigate the rockets.
   This dispute percolated until 1985, when new evidence
emerged. Deep beneath the North Atlantic, an American team of
oceanographers discovered the Titanic's final resting place,
several hundred miles off Newfoundland. The spot was close to
where Capt. Lord had always claimed it would be -- a fact,
Lordites argue, that corroborates a key claim in his defense:
That the Titanic and Californian were too far apart to have
seen each other that night.
   But anti-Lordites still dispute that reasoning. They say
locating the wreck of the Titanic says nothing about the
location of the Californian. The British government, however,
took the new theory seriously enough to reopen the case. The
fate of Capt. Lord's reputation is now with a special
examiner, Capt. Thomas Barnett, a retired government marine
surveyor.
   Whatever happened that night, Capt. Lord himself wasn't
without regrets. Rather than rely on the watch, he wished
that he had risen from his couch to inspect the situation on
the bridge himself. The result, he once told Mr. Harrison,
was "there's always this stigma: Was Lord to blame, or was he
not to blame?"

<HEAD>Underwater Robot Sill Sunken But $7 Million Science Project Stays

   Jason, the million-dollar submersible robot, was
still missing at sea Friday but its disappearance failed to sink a
$7 million high school science project.
   ``Jason's still down there, but we're optimistic,'' said Nancy
Green of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, home base to the
propeller-driven remote-control robot sunk to the bottom of the
Mediterranean Sea.
   More than 250,000 students in 13 cities in the United States and
Canada were boning up on plate tectonics and underwater volcanoes
in preparation for the start Monday of a massive satellite science
project gone slightly awry.
   On Wednesday, museums across North America were hooked up live
via satellite with the Star Hercules, a marine exploration ship
anchored over the ancient ruins of a sunken Roman trading ship off
the coast.
   As about 2,000 museum officials, teachers and technicians
watched, marine biologists began lowering the 7-foot-long robot and
its 8,000-pound mobile garage, Argo, into the ocean for a test run.
The footage was to be viewed by thousands of students during a
two-week period.
   All of a sudden, the live cameras focused in on a group of crew
members holding the severed cable that once had been Jason's
lifeline.
   In a flash, the horrible truth emerged: the million dollar robot
whose older brother nosed among the Titanic's ruins had sunk 2,100
feet to the soft, silty ocean floor.
   Green said a second consecutive day of churning seas and high
winds prevented Dr. Robert Ballard and his team of marine explorers
from sending down a second submersible to rescue its errant
predecessor.
   Paul Fontaine, coordinator for the project at Boston's Museum of
Science, said if necessary a slightly less sophisticated backup
would be used and the show would go on despite Jason's predicament.
   ``The kids won't be disappointed,'' he said. ``Even if they
can't pick him up before the project gets going, they'll just go
back and get Jason later.''
   Fontaine said the project, whose sponsors include Turner, Woods
Hole, Electronic Data Systems and the National Geographic Society,
would go on as scheduled between May 1-14.
   The participating museums are The Boston Museum of Science; the
Museum of Natural History in Denver; the Detroit Science Center;
the Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the Museum of Science and
Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.)
Pink Palace Museum; The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia; the
Rochester (N.Y.) Museum and Science Center; Mote Marine Laboratory
in Sarasota, Fla.; National Geographic Society Grosvenor Auditorium
in Washington and Dallas; and the Royal British Columbia Museum in
Victoria, British Columbia.

   The undersea exploration of a Roman
shipwreck will be witnessed by thousands of students via
``telepresence,'' an on-the-spot TV broadcast brought to them by the
discoverers of the wreck of the Titanic.
   Plans for the unprecedented educational project were unveiled
Wednesday by Robert Ballard, who led the team that found the sunken
Titanic in 1985.
   Students linked by satellite to at least nine science museums in
the United States and Canada will be able to communicate with
explorers directing an unmanned mobile camera as it combs the floor
of the Mediterranean Sea, Ballard said.
   While the $6 million, privately funded project involves several
advances in technology, Ballard said its main purpose is to excite
students about science, a field that he said has suffered dwindling
influence in America.
   ``We really have a crisis of education in the United States,''
Ballard said at a news conference at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. In recent years, he said, science has failed to provide
young people with attractive role models.
   The role models they have instead are ``that scientists are
nerds, or as my kids would say, dweebs, and dweebs sit at terminals
and are dropouts from society.''
   In the project, the underwater robot named Jason that helped
explore the Titanic will send high-quality television pictures via
cable to a ship thousands of feet above on the sea surface. For 14
days next May, the ship and its 50-member crew _ including six high
school students _ will control the movements of the robot and send
back satellite images from two underwater locations.
   The broadcasts will be transmitted via the Turner Broadcasting
System and Electronic Data Systems Corp. to science museums in
Boston, Chicago, Memphis, Tenn., Washington, D.C., Dallas,
Philadelphia, Rochester, N.Y., Charlotte, N.C., and Victoria,
British Columbia.
   In addition, the National Geographic Society plans to produce a
TV special on the expedition.
   The ship's crew will broadcast six programs a day, or a total of
84 40-minute programs, that will be seen by about 200,000 students.
   Instead of simply watching the programs, the students will have
before them a multiscreen ``control room'' that replicates the
control center on the mother ship above Jason. Students will be able
to ask questions of the crew, see images on a number of television
screens and, in some cases, even take over the controls of Jason,
Ballard said.
   Ballard called the concept ``telepresence.''
   The plan is for Jason to explore an undersea volcano field off
the west coast of Italy where minor eruptions, emissions of molten
minerals and an abundance of wildlife should be visible. At another
Mediterranean site, which Ballard declined to disclose, Jason will
photograph a vast debris field believed to be the remains of several
Roman shipwrecks from the second century.
   Ballard said the goals of the program, which he calls the ``Jason
Project,'' are both ambitious and basic. ``One of the major focuses
of the program is to teach people where the Mediterranean is,''
Ballard said.
   ``It's a tremendous interest-generator,'' said Frank Ireton of
the National Science Teachers Association, which is helping science
teachers who will take their classes to the programs.
   ``If we have 200,000 students and we interest 10 percent of them
in science, my gosh, that's a tremendous benefit,'' he said.

   The discoverers of the sunken Titanic
announced a venture Wednesday designed to bring undersea exploration
of a Roman shipwreck to thousands of students across the country via

   Instead, he said, the role models are ``that scientists are

and are dropouts from society.''
   In the ``Jason Project,'' named after the underwater robot that

   The live broadcasts will be transmitted via the Turner
Broadcasting System in Atlanta and Electronic Data Systems Corp. in
Atlanta to the nine science museums in Boston, Chicago, Memphis,
Washington, D.C., Dallas, Philadelphia, Rochester, N.Y., Charlotte,
N.C., and Victoria, British Columbia. The shipboard crew will
broadcast six programs a day or 84 40-minute programs in all that

A Norwegian coast guard ship cut through thick Arctic ice Tuesday to rescue 
hundreds of people who had taken refuge on ice floes and in lifeboats after 
their Soviet cruise liner hit an iceberg and took on water. All of the nearly 
600 passengers were reported safe. 
</P>
<P>
"All the passengers are now off the vessel and only (some of the) the crew 
remains," said Arne Finne, a spokesman for the Rescue Center in Bodoe, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the day, some of the Soviet crew members -- who had remained aboard the 
Maxim Gorky -- stabilized the badly listing vessel and sailed toward port with 
the help of a coast guard ship and several pumps flown from Norway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
740 Reach Spitsbergen 
</P>
<P>
Early today -- more than 25 hours after their ordeal began -- about 740 
passengers and crew of the estimated 950 aboard reached the Norwegian Arctic 
outpost at Spitsbergen, officials said. Passengers were taken to the airport on 
the tiny island of 1,000 people for chartered flights back home. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the Soviet crew had worked to keep the 630-foot ocean liner 
afloat in the Norwegian Sea, about 185 miles west of Spitsbergen, while the 
rescue ship and helicopters saved passengers huddling in blankets in the 
near-freezing temperatures. There were no reports of serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky rammed the iceberg in the foggy Arctic twilight shortly after 
midnight, when many of the passengers were partying in a shipboard nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly there was a terrible crash that almost shook me from my bed," said 
Rudolf Ludwig, 67, of Wiesbaden, West Germany, one of the passengers on the 
midnight sun cruise who was evacuated by helicopter to Norway's Svalbard 
island. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told to get into the lifeboats," Ludwig said. "We sat for five hours 
among the icebergs. The atmosphere was calm, and the Russian sailors did 
everything they could. They gave us vodka and whiskey in the boats, since it 
was cold. And blankets, too." 
</P>
<P>
West German passenger Win-fried Prince said there was no panic, and "the 
Russian crew has worked perfectly in disembarking passengers into lifeboats, 
and also the Norwegians who picked us up . . . have done a wonderful job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ripped Two Holes 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred early Tuesday when the iceberg ripped two holes in the 
ship, which quickly took on water. Passengers said three decks became 
submerged. 
</P>
<P>
The coast guard vessel Senja, its bow reinforced for ice-breaking, rushed to 
the site about 300 miles east of northern Greenland. It reached the area after 
about four hours to begin rescue work. Soviet ships arrived later to continue 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Although reports of the number of people aboard the liner varied, the agency 
that chartered the vessel said there were 953 aboard -- 575 passengers and 378 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
Johannes Zurnieden, manager of the Phoenix-Flugreisen tourist agency in West 
Germany, said all but 16 of the passengers were West Germans. The others 
included Austrian, Swiss, Italian, British, Dutch and Swedish passengers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clambered Into Lifeboats 
</P>
<P>
After the accident, about 350 passengers clambered into lifeboats and some were 
taken to ice floes before being plucked to safety by Norwegian and Soviet 
helicopters. They later were moved onto a Norwegian rescue vessel in the 
Barents Sea, the coast guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 200 passengers who had remained aboard the 25,000-ton vessel were 
evacuated and picked up by the Senja. 
</P>
<P>
The captain of the Senja, Sigurd Kleiven, said the Maxim Gorky had two gashes 
in the starboard hull, one measuring 30 inches by 8 feet and the other 2 inches 
by 19 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Kleiven said that after his ship's arrival, two of the Senja's pumps were taken 
aboard the crippled liner. One pump later broke down. 
</P>
<P>
Divers inspected the gashes, but there was nothing available to plug them with, 
Kleiven said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Finn B. Hansen of the North Norway Rescue Coordination Center said the 
Soviet tugboat Sarja arrived with more pumps and two more vessels steamed 
toward the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like there is enough new pumping equipment aboard to keep it afloat," 
Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, the crew managed to stabilize the ship despite the gashes and set 
sail for Barentsburg, 300 miles to the east, trailed by a coast guard ship, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is under control, thanks to comprehensive pumping equipment 
continuously brought to the vessel throughout the day," a coast guard spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky had set out June 11 from Bremerhaven, West Germany, sailed to 
Iceland and, then, while sailing around the Spitsbergen island chain on its way 
to Norway, struck the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Meteorological Institute sends out weekly ice charts of the area, 
but the situation changes too quickly to be dependable for navigation, the 
Norwegian news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was reportedly foggy at the time of the accident, it was not fully 
dark because the area around the Arctic Circle is light nearly 24 hours a day 
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven years ago, on April 14, 1912, the British luxury liner Titanic 
hit an iceberg just south of Newfoundland on its maiden voyage. Of 2,224 people 
aboard, 1,513 died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fared Better 
</P>
<P>
Steinar Breivik at the Bodoe Rescue Center said the Maxim Gorky fared better 
because damage to the Titanic was apparently much worse and because the Soviet 
vessel "received pumping equipment within a few hours, both from land and from 
other ships." 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky was built in West Germany in 1969 and sold to the Soviet Union 
in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have been involved in the cruise business for foreigners for about 
15 years. The Soviet merchant fleet began expanding passenger liners for the 
cruise trade as well as purchasing new ships during the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The collision with the iceberg is the latest disaster or near-disaster reported 
openly under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reformist policy of 
disclosure of events. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst Soviet shipping disaster, the cruise ship Admiral Nakhimov was 
rammed by a grain freighter in the Black Sea in August, 1986, killing 398 of 
1,236 people aboard.

<HEAD>Seized Research Vessel Likely To be Returned to Owners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A research vessel that was part of the Titanic
exploration, seized under the government's ``zero-tolerance''
policy after a small amount of marijuana was found, will probably
be returned to its owners, officials say.
   Atlantis II was seized here Wednesday after a routine inspection
turned up traces of marijuana and two pipes in the shaving kit of
one of the ship's 25 crew members, a U.S. Customs Service spokesman
said Thursday.
   Spokesman Mike Fleming said it was clear the 210-foot vessel's
owners, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole,
Mass., ``were innocent parties. They've been extremely cooperative
in this matter.''
   Crew member Richard Morris, 27, of Buzzards Bay, Mass., pleaded
guilty Thursday to a misdemeanor charge of drug possession, said
Fleming. Morris was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $100.
   The vessel's owners are forwarding a letter to Customs
supporting the anti-drug effort and assuring officials they intend
to tighten security aboard the ship, Fleming said.
   ``Once we receive their agreement and their letter outlining the
procedures they will take, then we fully intend to return the
Atlantis II to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,'' he said.
   Atlantis II and its contents, including a three-person research
submarine named Alvin, are worth $80 million, Fleming said.
   Atlantis II arrived in San Diego Wednesday from Guatemala, where
it had stopped for supplies after geological and biological
research work near the Galapagos Islands, said Derek Spencer, the
institution's director of research.
   The seizure shocked the scientific community at Woods Hole,
where the ship is based, said Spencer.
   Construction of Atlantis II and Alvin was substantially funded
by federal research agencies, Spencer said. He noted that the
25-foot Alvin is owned by the Navy.
   Scientists aboard Atlantis II used Alvin in 1986 to explore and
photograph the North Atlantic site where the Titanic lies.
   The luxury liner went down 74 years ago after striking an
iceberg only five days into its maiden voyage. More than 1,500
people died. Scientists found the Titanic in September 1985 on a
joint U.S.-French expedition.
   At least 22 vessels have been seized across the country since
the zero-tolerance policy went into effect.

<LEADPARA>  Sea ice has set records on both sides of the world, with more in the Atlantic
and less in the Far East than ever recorded, government scientists said
Friday.;    Ice in the Atlantic reached 60 miles farther south than the record
set last April and was nearly to the region where an iceberg sank the Titanic
in 1912, the Navy-NOAA Joint Ice Center reported.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At the same time, sea ice reached a record minimum in the Sea of Okhotsk,
north of Japan, said Josh McDowell of NOAA.;    The Navy's and National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's center in Suitland, Md., tracks sea
ice as a warning service for shipping, seeking to prevent disasters like that
of the British liner Titanic.;    The maximum extent of the ice reached nearly
to the latitude of Boston -- though far to the east -- before pulling back
this week, officials said.;    Normally, sea ice reaches its maximum in April
in the North Atlantic. Cold weather could lead to an extension of the ice
edge, McDowell cautioned.;    Detailed information on the extent of sea ice
goes back only to 1972, when satellites began tracking frozen areas.;   
During that period, McDowell said, growth of ice on one side of the planet has
been accompanied by a decline on the other side.;    Sea ice is a sheet of
frozen salt water several inches thick along its edge, McDowell explained.
Temperatures have to be about 29 degrees Fahrenheit to freeze seawater.;   
While the sea ice could damage a ship that was not specially strengthened, it
was not the cause of the Titanic's demise. That ship fell victim to a floating
iceberg. Icebergs are large chunks of ice that break away from land and float
south.;    More than 1,500 people died when the Titanic struck the floating
mass of ice and sank April 14, 1912, on its first Atlantic crossing.  </TEXT>

   A chronology compiled by the National
Geographic Society of the fate of the German World War II battleship
Bismarck:
   1936 _ Construction starts in Hamburg of the 820-foot ship with a
displacement, when fully loated, of more than 50,000 tons, carrying
eight 15-inch guns, 12 5.9-inch guns and 16 4.1-inch guns and a crew
of 2,200 and capable of a top speed of 30 knots.
   Feb. 14, 1939 _ On St. Valentine's Day, Adolf Hitler launches the
ship.
   May 19, 1941 _ After more than two years in fitting and shakedown
cruises, the Bismarck sets sail from Gdynia, Poland with orders to
sink Allied merchant ships in the Atlantic while evading engagement
with allied warships.
   May 20, 1941 _ A Swedish cruiser spots the Bismarck and its
escort, the Prinz Eugen, off the coast of neutral Sweden. Later they
are sighted off the coast of Norway.
   May 21, 1941 _ British Spitfires over the Bergen-Korsfjord region
of Norway spot the two German ships. The British send the battle
cruiser Hood to join other British ships on patrol in the Denmark
Strait.
   May 22, 1941 _ More British forces head for the search zone.
   May 23, 1941 _ In the Denmark Strait beteen Greenland and
Iceland, the British cruisers Suffolk and Norfolk sight the German
ship threading through a minefield. The Bismarck opens fire, but the
British retire safely. The British follow the Germans despite rain
and snow storms and dangerous ice floes. The Hood and the Prince of
Wales are closing in from about 250 miles away.
   May 24 _ At 5:35 a.m., the Hood and Prince of Wales sight the
Bismarck and open fire. The Germans return fire. At 6:01 a.m., a
massive explosion sinks the Hood, leaving only three of its 1,419
crewmen alive. The Bismarck suffers a ruptured fuel tank. The
Bismarck engages the British again in the evening. The Prinz Eugen
escapes. The Bismarck's commander decides to make for a French port
for repairs. A British force heads to the area from Gibraltar.
Around midnight, nine British biplanes attack, causing little damage.
   May 25 _ About 3 a.m., the Bismarck evades its chasers and heads
for the safety of U-boat patrols and Luftwaffe air cover, near the
coast of France.
   May 26 _ A British plane spots the Bismarck. In a last-ditch
effort to stop it before it reaches safety, planes from a British
carrier score two torpedo hits that wreck the Bismarck's steering
gear and jam her rudders, only hours from safety. The Bismarck's
fate is sealed.
   May 27 _ At 8:47 a.m., a British force opens up on the limping
Bismarck, putting its main guns out of action. By 10 a.m., the
Bismarck is a battered hulk. By 10:39 a.m. it has capsized and sunk,
coming to rest upright on the ocean floor with only 115 of its crew
of 2,200 rescued.

   Auditorium lights dimmed and thousands of
youngsters nationwide went silent Monday when a $7 million science
project whisked them to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, live
and in color.
   Television screens showed them the satellite-relayed view of a
camera-equipped submersible robot being towed over the ocean floor.
It was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an expected
250,000 students at 13 museums from British Columbia to Florida.
   The project suffered a temporary setback last week when the
7-foot-long robot Jason, a newer version of the camera-carrying
submersible that explored the sunken ocean liner Titanic, sank
among the ruins of an ancient Roman trading ship off the coast of
Italy.
   The cable used to lower the million-dollar Jason and its mobile
garage or transporter, Argo, snapped and the pair plunged 2,100
feet to the soft, silty ocean floor.
   Organizers said the show would go on _ with or without Jason.
The robot was resurrected apparently undamaged Saturday but still
wasn't used in Monday's 40-minute broadcast.
   Jason has propellers and can be remotely guided in and around
underwater objects. Its replacement Monday, Medea, was merely a
sophisticated camera platform that is towed over a target area from
the surface.
   In addition to the underwater shots, expedition leader Robert
Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic, talked to the students from the
bridge of the support ship Star Hercules in the Mediterranean. He
took questions from students at three of the 13 participating
museums, narrated live footage of underwater volcanoes and
introduced films on satellite technology and the ancient Greek
voyager Jason, for whom the 20th-century undersea robot was named.
   ``Our journey to the Mediterranean has been anything but
uneventful,'' Ballard said in recounting Jason's mishap. ``The
voyage became a nonstop exercise in problem-solving.''
   During weeks of lessons and classroom discussion, the students
have developed an affection for the little robot explorer.
   The biggest laugh of the morning came when a boy identified only
as Kenneth, a grade-school student from Memphis, Tenn., got to
question Ballard.
   ``Is Jason alright?'' he asked.
   ``Jason is fine,'' Ballard said. ``His pride's a little hurt but
luckily none of his instrumentation is.''
   Greg Tardiff, a seventh grader from Beverly, Mass., said word of
Jason's loss last week spread rapidly through the Shore Country Day
School.
   ``We were crushed,'' the 13-year-old said. ``We thought the
whole thing would be called off.''
   Paul Fontaine of Boston's Museum of Science said he was
``thrilled'' with the show's premiere, although disappointed that
the slightly less than state-of-the-art stand-in took Jason's place.
   ``Jason is the superior robot and probably could have picked a
bigger variety of images,'' he said. ``But it was still a pretty
impressive show.''
   For some of the kids, too, the show wasn't quite the same
without Jason.
   ``The teachers said it was going to be so real that it would
seem like the water could come right off the screen,'' said
10-year-old Almas Rathod of the Walter J. Paton School in
Shrewsbury, Mass. ``It wasn't like that.''
   But classmate Barry Lyall said it met his expectations.
   ``It's much more interesting than hearing about it in a
classroom,'' the 9-year-old native of Scotland said. ``It was the
next best thing to being there.''
   The project sponsors include Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution , Turner Broadcasting System Inc., the National
Geographic Society and Electronic Data Systems.
   In addition to Woods Hole, participating museums are The Boston
Museum of Science; the Museum of Natural History in Denver; the
Detroit Science Center; the Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the
Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in
Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.) Pink Palace Museum; The Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia; the Rochester (N.Y.) Museum and Science Center;
Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Fla.; National Geographic
Society Grosvenor Auditorium in Washington; and the Royal British
Columbia Museum in Victoria, British Columbia.

<HEAD>Argentine Ship Sinks Off Antarctica</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: REORGANIZES throughout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Argentine supply ship that ran
aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds,
the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could
leak and damage the environment.
   The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso followed warnings from
the U.S. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic
could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel
aboard the ship were to spill.
   No injuries were reported in the sinking. Tourists aboard and the
crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south
of Cape Horn, the tip of South America. Salvage efforts had been
hampered by 50 mph winds.
   The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the
government news agency Telam said, citing a navy communique. Telam
did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when
it went down.
   The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately
known.
   The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline
and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station
near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science
Foundation said in a statement released in Washington.
   The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer
Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the
continent's tip. It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and
some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing
ashore near Palmer station.
   The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a
vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins,
sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the National Science Foundation
statement said.
   There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the
wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
   Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank
that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife,
had stopped.
   ``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may
already have been affected by the leak,'' a foundation statement
said. It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive
Thursday or Friday.
   Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
   Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: ``The fuel it
carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel
drums so a spill is practically impossible.''
   The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82
passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and
taken to Palmer Station.
   The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to
the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the
South American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the
station, said Renerie.
   Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been
rationed to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement
said.

   The strongest typhoon to hit the
Philippines this year swept across central islands today with 125
mph winds, killing at least one person, sinking numerous ships and
forcing thousands to flee their homes.
   The navy said a merchant ship with 16 crew members was missing
off Mindanao island and that 16 boats had sunk off Cebu island.
Three sailors were reported missing in the Cebu sinkings.
   At least 17 people, including six Americans, were trapped on an
oil rig off Palawan island after 68 other workers were evacuated,
said Maj. Antonio Babijes, chief of the Manila Rescue Coordinating
Center.
   He said officials asked U.S. Air Force and Navy authorities to
assist in evacuating the rig after a rescue boat was forced back by
rough seas. The rig is operated by Alcorn Production-Philippines
Inc.
   The confirmed death occurred in the Panay island province of
Capiz when a tree fell on a 10-year-old boy, a spokeswoman for the
governor said.
   Typhoon Mike made landfall on Leyte island eary today and was by
midday centered over Iloilo City on Panay island, about 290 miles
southeast of Manila, the capital's weather bureau said.
   Senior forecaster Daniel Dimagiba said the storm's maximum
sustained winds had weakened to 103 mph and that it was moving at
19 mph west-northwest after crossing Leyte, Cebu and Negros and
hitting Panay islands.
   Cmdr. Ruben Lista, spokesman of the Philippine navy, said a
distress call was received from the cargo ship Dona Roberta early
today.
   The call said the ship was taking in water about 500 miles south
of Manila, Lista said. It was the last radio contact with the ship,
which was presumed to have sank, he added.
   In Cebu, Lista said, 16 vessels sank off the Cebu docks and six
others ran aground.
   He said huge waves pushed a passenger ship into a navy patrol
craft and another domestic ferry, sinking the three vessels. He
said there were no reports if the vessels were had passengers at
the time.
   Three navy utility crafts also sank nearby and three sailors
were reported missing in two of the vessels, he added.
   On Negros island, a spokeswoman from the office of the governor
of Negros Occidental province said about 9,500 people were forced
to flee their homes in six towns. Officials said nearly 200 houses
had been destroyed or damaged.
   The seas were dangerous to all types of vessels. Philippine
Airlines canceled 59 domestic flights, but international flights
were unaffected.
   The typhoon is the 14th to hit the Philippines this year. About
20 typhoons hit the country yearly.
   It was the strongest typhoon to come ashore here this year and
the strongest to enter the country's waters since December,
Dimagiba said.
   Mike struck Palau island over the weekend, toppling trees,
devastating crops and battering buildings.

<TEXT>
   Underwater explorer Robert Ballard will guide
more than 250,000 children through a high-tech tour of two
shipwrecks from the War of 1812 in a science project sponsored by
the Jason Foundation for Education.
   About 40 children will accompany Ballard to Lake Ontario to
examine the remains of the Hamilton and Scourge, which Ballard
called ``incredible archeological treasures.'' More than a
quarter-million more students will view the expedition on screens
via satellite links in schools and museums across the United States
and Canada.
   The Jason Foundation, named for a robotic device used in the
explorations, last year went to the Mediterranean Sea to look at an
underground volcano and the deepest known ancient shipwreck site.
   Cameras will take the children on close-up tours of the lake and
sunken ships. They will be able to ask questions of Ballard during
the presentations and may also be permitted to operate the robot
through the satellite link, Ballard said.
   Ballard, senior scientist for the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts, discovered the Titanic in 1985 and
the German battleship Bismarck last year. He founded the Jason
Foundation for Education, a joint venture of educators, scientists,
museums and private industry, to encourage scientific careers among
American children.
   Ballard said there are no American graduate students at Woods
Hole, which is affiliated with MIT, and 60 percent of applicants
for the coming year are foreign. ``We are hopelessly behind France,
Germany, England and Japan,'' Ballard said. He said the problem
begins in grades 4-12 and results in widespread scientific
illiteracy.
   The Jason project will train more than 4,000 teachers in a
curriculum developed specifically for the Lake Ontario expedition.
Their pupils will be well-grounded in engineering, robotics, marine
biology, archeology, maritime history and other relevant areas by
the time Ballard and his crew begin broadcasting live from the lake
bottom on April 30.
   The next Jason project will take students to the Galapagos
Islands off the coast of Ecuador, Ballard said. The foundation may
also do a joint project in the South Pacific with Japan on the 50th
anniversary of Pearl Harbor in 1991, and may work with the
government of Spain on a 500th-anniversary commemoration of
Columbus' 1492 voyage to America.

<DATELINE>WOODS HOLE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beginning in 1930, with $3 million from
the Rockefeller Foundation and a small ship called Atlantis,
scientists began exploring the ocean from this tiny seaport at one
corner of Cape Cod.
   Since then, oceanographers from Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution have discovered vast underwater mountain ranges,
strange life forms in the Galapagos Islands, hot water springs
miles beneath the ocean surface and even the RMS Titanic.
   Even the movie ``Jaws'' featured Richard Dreyfuss as a scientist
from Woods Hole called in for his expertise on the great white
shark.
   Indeed, after 60 years of exhaustive research, experimentation
and technology, scientists at Woods Hole can say this with pride:
Men have now seen 1 percent of the ocean floor.
   One percent? This from a nation that sent men to the moon two
decades ago? Scientists at Woods Hole will tell you that time and
money would be better spent here.
   ``It's much more important that we use the tremendous technology
we have to understand ourselves,'' said John Steele, a senior
scientist at Woods Hole and former director of the institution.
``We have major scientific problems as well as social concerns here
on Earth.''
   The success of the scientists at Woods Hole is remarkable given
the lack of glamour attached to oceanography and the scarcity of
funds available for research.
   The government spends about $390 million in oceanographic
research annually. In contrast, President Bush proposed this year a
$15.2 billion space agency budget.
   ``Perhaps we aren't as good at selling ourselves as NASA,'' said
Steele. ``But we also all had, even scientists, the mistaken belief
that the bottom of the ocean was flat and uninteresting.
   ``Without the capabilities of Woods Hole and other institutions,
we wouldn't understand the Gulf Stream and why it's important to
problems of climate. We wouldn't have made wonderful discoveries
under the sea bed and we wouldn't have appreciated the marine life
in the deep ocean.''
   It can be as tricky to send scientists down to the ocean's
average depth of 12,000 feet as it is to send astronauts into
space. The incredible pressure and the absence of light make the
construction of underwater vehicles and other technology laborious
and expensive.
   But the marine biologists, geologists, engineers, divers,
technicians, chemists, physicists and many others who comprise the
900 employees at Woods Hole believe many of the solutions to the
world's environmental crisis may lie beneath the ocean surface.
   Woods Hole is the largest private oceanographic institute in the
world and relies mostly on grants, about 80 percent of them from
the federal government. Unlike its West Coast counterpart, the
state university-affiliated Scripps Institute in La Jolla, Calif.,
Woods Hole does not receive state money. It has an operating budget
of $67 million a year.
   As a result, Woods Hole scientists have been likened to
entrepreneurs, each in charge of their own destiny and relying on
their creativity and vision to come up with successful grant
proposals.
   Among the 350 projects at Woods Hole, one of the most eagerly
anticipated is the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, a global
study of sea patterns. The 10-year, $100 million project will track
how the ocean influences climate over periods longer than weather
forecasts of a few weeks.
   Scientists from the Soviet Union, China, Brazil, Britain,
France, Spain and Australia, among others, are part of the project.
They began gathering at Woods Hole more than three years ago to map
the project.
   ``The ocean plays a significant role in determining the impact
of the greenhouse effect,'' said Terrence Joyce, a senior scientist
at Woods Hole who is directing the hydrographic program for the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment. ``WOCE will give us an idea of
how the ocean affects climate change and allow us to better predict
the future.''
   Woods Hole, or WHOI (pronounced ``Hooey'' by local residents and
employees), has been on the cutting edge of oceanography and marine
science since its inception. It was founded following a
recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences that an American
oceanographic lab was needed on the East Coast.
   The sprawling ``campus'' of Woods Hole dominates the small town,
which extends like a little finger off the southwestern corner of
Cape Cod. The large brick buildings of Woods Hole line the
village's main street, with water on both sides.
   The campus consists of four large laboratories and a variety of
smaller buildings in the village of Woods Hole and on the nearby
200-acre Quissett campus. The institution offers a graduate degree
program for future oceanographers with the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.
   Work at sea is conducted aboard three large research vessels, a
smaller coastal vessel and the Alvin, a three-person, deep-water
submersible.
   During World War II, Woods Hole researchers developed
anti-fouling paint, which prevented barnacles from forming on the
hulls of boats, and the bathythermograph, an instrument that gives
a record of temperature layers in the ocean.
   Since 1964, scientists at Woods Hole have been able to penetrate
the ocean frontier with the aid of Alvin, which has made more than
2,000 dives all over the world and can go as deep as 13,000 feet.
   Alvin's most dramatic early mission was reminiscent of the film
``Dr. Strangelove.'' In 1966, two military planes collided over
Spain and a hydrogen bomb fell into the Mediterranean. Alvin pilots
found the device and then relocated it after it slipped down a
steep slope during a recovery attempt.
   In 1974, Alvin joined Project FAMOUS, a French-American undersea
study and collected the first-ever photographs and samples of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
   Woods Hole has a celebrity scientist, Robert Ballard, who
discovered the wreck of the Titanic in 1985. Ballard discovered the
German battleship Bismarck last year. He also is host of the PBS's
National Geographic ``Explorer'' TV series.
   ``Woods Hole tends to support high-risk people more than a
public institution would,'' said Ballard. ``It's very comparable to
private industry versus the government. There's a greater risk if
you fail, but it lets you try.''

SOVIET SUBMARINE SINKS OFF NORWAY; 
</P>

NUCLEAR-DRIVEN CRAFT GOES DOWN AFTER FIRE; 'MAJOR LOSS OF LIFE' REPORTED

<P>
An advanced Soviet attack submarine caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea 
on Friday, U.S. and Norwegian government sources reported. A Soviet official in 
Oslo confirmed that it had sunk. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear-powered Mike-class submarine, which can carry a crew of 95, 
suffered a catastrophic accident involving "major loss of life," one U.S. 
government official said. An American monitoring reports on the incident said 
the vessel surfaced briefly, then sank. 
</P>
<P>
At the Soviet Embassy in Oslo, a spokesman early today said the submarine sank 
but gave no other information, Reuters news agency reported, quoting the 
Norwegian news agency NTB. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they did not know what weapons the craft was carrying, but 
that it is capable of launching SS-N-21 cruise missiles with either nuclear or 
conventional warheads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believed One of a Kind 
</P>
<P>
The accident involving the submarine, believed to be the only one of its kind, 
may provide an intelligence bonanza for the United States and its allies if 
reconnaissance ships, aircraft or satellites were able to take detailed, 
close-up photographs of the rare craft as it surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Defense Ministry said that Soviet ships and aircraft were in the 
area where the sub was lost, in international waters off Spitsbergen Island 
near the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said Norwegian military aircraft had flown over the area, about 
300 miles from North Cape on the Norwegian mainland, and had seen the submarine 
ablaze. Officials said the fire appeared to be concentrated in the stern, or 
rear, of the vessel, where water distillation equipment and propulsion 
machinery are housed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have observed bodies," Norwegian Defense Minister Johan Jorgen Holst told 
NTB. "We do not yet have an exact figure." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast on Britain's Independent Television News, Norwegian 
Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Gullow Gjeseth said that in a flight over the 
submarine, "I saw at the time two dinghies, with the personnel in one dinghy. 
We saw also a Soviet merchant ship in the area and we know also Soviet aircraft 
have been over the area." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have built only one submarine of this type, according to "Jane's 
Fighting Ships," the authoritative British reference book on the world's 
navies. U.S. naval intelligence analysts said it was built as a platform for 
experiments in submarine design, and may have special coatings and a unique 
propulsion system. The sub's design reduces both the turbulence and noise that 
the boat creates when it is moving, making it harder to locate in the 
cat-and-mouse game that U.S. and Soviet submarines play undersea. 
</P>
<P>
The 361-foot-long vessel was launched at Severodvinsk in May, 1983. It was 
powered by twin, liquid-metal-cooled nuclear reactors and had an estimated top 
speed of 38 knots. 
</P>
<P>
The double-hulled ship was probably made of titanium for weight and noise 
reduction, according to Jane's. Norman Polmar, an independent American naval 
analyst, said the submarine could have been carrying as many as six 
nuclear-tipped torpedoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Information Available 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials had little 
information on the incident Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"There are indications there was a major fire aboard, but we have no details. 
We understand there has been a loss of life but we can't confirm how many," 
Fitzwater said. "We express the sympathy of the United States government to the 
Soviet government for any loss of life involved." President Bush had been 
notified of the accident, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The area of the sinking in the Norwegian Sea is the site of many naval 
exercises by both Eastern and Western forces and is considered a potential 
battleground in the event of a large-scale conflict. Western forces practice 
keeping Soviet submarines away from Atlantic shipping lanes, while Soviet 
vessels patrol there to keep track of Western ships. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst said that before sinking, the submarine could have released its 
ballast, causing the ship to pop up high on the surface of the ocean, exposing 
some of the sub's underside. 
</P>
<P>
"This really could be an intelligence coup," said one American naval analyst. 
When a disabled Soviet Victor-class submarine surfaced off Newport, R.I., in 
the mid-1980s, analysts reaped a harvest of valuable intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
But the accident poses potentially severe environmental hazards as well. 
Previous submarine accidents have resulted in release of radiation, and in 1961 
members of a Soviet submarine crew died of radiation poisoning after an 
accident in the Baltic, according to recently declassified CIA documents. 
</P>
<P>
John Holdren, professor of energy and resources at UC Berkeley and an expert on 
nuclear issues who has served as an adviser to the Department of Energy, said 
that if radiation leaked from the vessel's reactors from the sea bottom, not 
much would reach the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean and the chemicals naturally occurring in it have a diluting effect on 
radiation, he said. The submarine would probably come to rest so far down that 
little radiation is likely to reach the surface or contaminate edible fish, 
which generally inhabit waters less deep. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . One could imagine an effect on fisheries," Holdren said, "but in 
previous nuclear submarine accidents there has not been enough damage to the 
reactor to produce a big effect." 
</P>
<P>
The latest incident is the fifth known sinking of a Soviet nuclear-powered 
submarine. A Soviet Yankee-class ballistic missile sub sank 600 miles east of 
Bermuda in 1986. A Charlie-class cruise-missile submarines went down off 
Kamchatka Peninsula in 1983. And in 1970, a November-class torpedo-attack 
submarine sank off the Atlantic coast of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the best-known incident, the forward section of a Soviet Golf-class 
submarine that had sunk northwest of Hawaii in 1968 was recovered from the 
seabed in 1974 by the American salvage vessel Glomar Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
Two U.S. nuclear submarines have been lost at sea -- the Thresher off the U.S. 
East Coast in 1963 with the loss of 129 lives, and the Scorpion off the Azores 
Islands in 1968, with 99 men killed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, then-Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr. told reporters, "We do have 
firm evidence that their (Soviet) standards of safety -- and crew safety -- are 
far lower than ours in nuclear power plants." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Maura Dolan, in Los Angeles, contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<HEAD>Kids Nationwide Tune In To $7 Million Science Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A popular robot was relegated to the sidelines,
but thousands of excited schoolchildren still watched in awe as a
$7 million science project lit up screens nationwide, whisking
viewers to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.
   The satellite-relayed view from a camera-equipped submersible
robot Monday was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an
expected 250,000 students at 13 museums from British Columbia to
Florida.
   The project suffered a temporary setback last week when Jason,
the 7-foot long robot whose older brother first explored the sunken
Titanic, sank among the ruins of an ancient Roman trading ship off
the coast of Italy.
   The cable used to lower the million-dollar submersible and its
mobile garage, Argo, snapped and the pair plunged 2,100 feet to the
soft, silty ocean floor.
   The robot was recovered apparently undamaged Saturday, but sat
out the first 40-minute broadcast Monday.
   The biggest laugh of the morning came when Kenneth, a grade
school student from Memphis, Tenn., had a chance to question Dr.
Robert Ballard, the head of the expedition.
   ``Is Jason all right?'' he asked, his voice crackling over a
3,000-mile connection to the support ship, Star Hercules.
   ``Jason is fine,'' Ballard told his student audience via the
two-way hookup. ``His pride's a little hurt, but luckily none of
his instrumentation is.''
   Ballard sought to reassure the students, who have through weeks
of lessons and classroom discussion developed an affection for the
little propeller-driven robot explorer.
   Jason can be remotely driven in and around underwater objects.
Its replacement Monday, Medea, is merely a sophisticated camera
platform that is towed to the ocean floor.
   Broadcasting from his control center on the bridge, Ballard took
questions from students at three of the 13 participating museums,
narrated live footage of underwater volcanoes and set the stage for
pre-prepared films on satellite technology and the ancient Greek
voyager Jason, for whom the 20th century robot was named.
   For some of the kids, the show wasn't quite the same without its
star.
   ``The teachers said it was going to be so real that it would
seem like the water could come right off the screen,'' said
10-year-old Almas Rathod of the Walter J. Paton School in
Shrewsbury, Mass. ``It wasn't like that.''
   But classmate Barry Lyall said the field trip had lived up to
his expectations.
   ``It's much more interesting than hearing about it in a
classroom,'' the 9-year-old native of Scotland said. ``It was the
next best thing to being there.''
   The project, whose sponsors include Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., the National
Geographic Society and Electronic Data Systems, was scheduled to
move 120 miles southwest next week, where it will broadcast from
the site of a 2,000-year-old Roman trading ship.
   The participating museums are The Boston Museum of Science; the
Museum of Natural History in Denver; the Detroit Science Center;
Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the Museum of Science and
Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.)
Pink Palace Museum; The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia; the
Rochester (N.Y.) Museum and Science Center; Mote Marine Laboratory
in Sarasota, Fla.; National Geographic Society Grosvenor Auditorium
in Washington and Dallas; and the Royal British Columbia Museum in
Victoria, British Columbia.

<LEADPARA>  Egyptian authorities planned to resume their search today for survivors of a
ferry accident in which as many as 471 people were feared drowned in stormy
weather in the Red Sea.;   Waves tossed the ferry, which was carrying 649
workers and pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia to Egypt, against a reef near
the small commercial Egyptian port of Safaga, sinking the boat in
shark-infested waters, officials said Sunday.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  471 FEARED DEAD AFTER FERRY SINKS IN RED SEA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     As many as 471 passengers were still missing Sunday night after a daylong
rescue effort that was hampered by high winds and 10-foot waves. Some were
believed to be possibly still stranded on lifeboats that drifted from the
rescue scene, where Australian and U.S. Navy helicopters briefly joined an
Egyptian armada plucking passengers and crew members from the sea.;   Egypt's
director of port security, Hassan al-Aghouri, said that by nightfall, rescuers
had picked up 178 survivors.;   Investigation ordered;   Egyptian Prime
Minister Atef Sidki and Interior Minister Abdel Halim Moussa traveled to the
site of the disaster in Safaga, about 60 miles south of the Red Sea tourist
resort city of Hurghada, and ordered an investigation into the cause of the
accident.;   The accident was probably the world's worst maritime disaster
since 1987, when a Philippines passenger ferry collided with an oil barge and
caught fire, leaving 4,386 people dead, and the second Red Sea shipping
accident this year. In April, 24 people died when an overloaded motor launch
sank about 60 miles north of Sunday's disaster site.;   Al-Aghouri identified
the ferry as the Egyptian-registered Salem Express owned by the Egyptian
Samatour Shipping Co., based in Alexandria. He said that the boat left
standard navigational channels and that investigators will question surviving
crew members about the change of course.;   Ship hit by 10 foot waves;   The
1,105-ton ship was sailing from Jidda, Saudi Arabia, to Safaga, a 36-hour
trip, when it was assaulted by 10-foot waves that were whipped by 40-mph
winds.;   The vessel rammed coral reefs about six miles off Safaga's harbor
about midnight Saturday and went down immediately, al-Aghouri said.;   He said
rescuers were unable to reach the area until dawn Sunday because of heavy
storms and high seas.;   Port official Islam Ahmed Zaki said high waves,
increasing winds, rain and darkness interrupted the search, which was to
resume early today.;   Authorities said they had pinpointed the location of
the sunken vessel about six miles off the coast of Egypt and would try to
raise it today.;   Some survivors criticized the crew for abandoning ship
without doing enough to help.;   One rescued passenger, agricultural engineer
Abdel-A'ati Hassan, said crew members told people to move to one side of the
listing ferry to keep it afloat, then abandoned ship.;   "They (crew members)
wore life preservers and left us and even pushed us aside to escape," Hassan
said from his bed at Safaga Central Hospital. "They left us with women and
kids, who died.";   The boat's first mate, Mahmoud Soleiman Rizake, said a
"terrible explosion" from the collision with the reef woke him in his cabin.; 
 "I got up and found that water was pouring in," he said in interviews with
the newspapers Al-Ahram and Algomhuria.;   He said he rushed to the deck to
help pump out the water, "but the ferry was swinging very strongly and losing
balance.";   "Waters flooded the ship in 10 minutes, causing it to sink," he
said, adding that he jumped overboard and swam until a rescue boat picked him
up.;   Red Sea full of sharks, reefs;   The Red Sea is noted for several
species of sharks, including the ferocious hammerhead. It also has some of the
world's greatest coral fields, treacherous for navigators.;   Egypt's deputy
director of port security, Brig. Abdel-Karim el-Gazzar, said that all but 10
of the 578 passengers were Egyptians, and that 292 were returning from
religious visits to Muslim holy places in Saudi Arabia.;   El-Gazzar said
foreign passengers included six Filipinos, two Malaysians, one Sudanese and
one Zaire national. A Sudanese also was among the 71-member crew, el-Gazzar
said.;   Cairo's state-owned radio quoted Samatour officials as saying that
the ship had veered off course in bad weather and that attempts had been made,
apparently unsuccessfully, to warn it.;   U.S. Navy officials in Bahrain said
warships on patrol in the Red Sea had not received a distress signal from the
stricken vessel, but they said that could mean either that the captain had not
used the normal emergency channel or that the ferry was outside the radio
range of ships patrolling in the region.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Sunken Robot Raised, Breathing New Life Into $7 Million Science Project</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The errant underwater robot Jason was raised from
the deep Saturday, breathing new life into a $7 million
international satellite science project whose submersible star had
unceremoniously sunk.
   ``The crew had prepared an understudy for the project, but now
the show can go on,'' said Paul Fontaine of Boston's Museum of
Science. ``Jason is back.''
   The 7-foot-long, remote-control robot will be on center stage
Monday as the first of 250,000 students in 13 cities across the
United States and Canada hook up via a two-way satellite with
marine explorers in the Mediterranean Sea.
   About 2,000 museum officials, teachers and technicians were
testing the system last week when Jason, a propeller-driven
submersible equipped with video camera and maneuverable arms,
disappeared overboard.
   Dr. Robert Ballard's rubber-booted assistants were easing the
million-dollar robot overboard off the coast of Italy when the
cable snapped and the younger brother of the robot that first nosed
among the Titanic's ruins sank 2,100 feet to the soft, silty ocean
floor.
   ``Everybody felt very badly about it,'' said Fontaine, one of
dozens of museums officials nationwide who have worked nearly two
years to coordinate the project.
   ``Jason's as much a member of the crew as anybody. He was on the
frontline, though, and everyone knows it's the frontline person who
takes the biggest risks,'' Fontaine said. ``It was particularly sad
because he hadn't even had the chance to show off his stuff.''
   But Shelley Lauzon, a spokeswoman for Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution on Cape Cod, said it was not immediately clear whether
Jason would be used in this week's explorations.
   ``But we're hopeful,'' she said. ``Everything seems to be fine.
But they'll be looking it all over before making a final decision.''
   Fontaine said his colleagues and school teachers nationwide
would be ``ecstatic'' to hear the good news about Jason, who has
been the focus of lesson plans in grade school classrooms around
the country.
   Lauzon said the support ship Star Hercules weighed anchor
Saturday and started steaming about 120 northeast to the spot where
Jason and his mobile garage, Argo, were to explore and broadcast
during the science project's first week.
   The May 1-14 project, whose sponsors include Woods Hole, Turner
Broadcasting System, the National Geographic Society and Electronic
Data Systems, will return to broadcast live during its second week
from the scene of Jason's unexpected brush with extinction.
   The participating museums are The Boston Museum of Science; the
Museum of Natural History in Denver; the Detroit Science Center;
the Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the Museum of Science and
Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.)

   The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler
Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic.
   The dead, many of them emaciated from Confederate prison camps,
totaled more than 1,500, but newspapers of the day gave scant
notice. The horror was lost in the greater gore of Civil War and
presidential assassination.
   Until now, there had been no marker here for the Union soldiers
who perished in the muddy Mississippi. But on Sunday, a six-foot
granite marker is being unveiled in Memphis' Elmwood Cemetery as a
reminder that the Sultana went down in flames just seven miles
north of the city's downtown riverfront.
   Built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76, the steamship was
carrying more than 2,300 people plus 100 horses and mules when
three of its four boilers exploded at 2 a.m. on April 27, 1865.
   Jerry Potter, a Memphis lawyer who has researched the disaster
for a dozen years and is writing a book on it, said Union officers
may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport
payments.
   ``There were two other steamboats that were trying to get a
portion of the men. The only explanation I have been able to
uncover for why the Sultana got them all is bribery,'' Potter said.
   Potter and Hugh Berryman, a forensic pathologist at the
University of Tennessee in Memphis, estimated the death toll at
1,547, 44 more than the number of people lost when the ocean liner
Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic in 1912.
   Other counts of the Sultana victims have put the total between
1,400 and 1,450, but Berryman said those estimates failed to
include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded at
Vicksburg, Miss.
   The monument, financed by three Memphis residents, will be the
second of two major markers to the disaster.
   The other, in Knoxville, was put up in 1916 by Sultana survivors
who raised money for the monument.
   Researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers
of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln two weeks earlier and with the end of the war.
   ``It was just lost to history because of the other events that
were going on at the time,'' Berryman said.
   The Mississippi has shifted its course since the Sultana went
down, and the steamboat's remains rest now under a soybean field
about a mile east of the river in Arkansas, Potter said.
   Excavating the boat could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,
and would produce little of commercial value since the wreck was
salvaged two months after it burned, he said.
   Berryman, who wrote a paper on the Sultana last year for the
Journal of Forensic Sciences, said survivors told of watching
dozens of victims drown en masse, hands clasped together as they
grappled for survival.
   ``Many of these victims had been through some of the roughest
battles in the war, and those experiences paled in comparison to
what they went through that night,'' he said.
   Most of the victims had recently been freed from prison camps in
Alabama and were headed north to be released from the Army. Many
were crowded onto two decks directly over the paddlewheeler's four
18-foot boilers, one of which had developed a leak that was hastily
repaired.
   When one of the boilers blew, setting off two others, the upper
decks collapsed forming a funnel that dumped dozens of victims into
the fire, Berryman said.
   The 263-foot boat, made of wood and covered with flammable
paint, was equipped with 76 life jackets. Many of the survivors
also escaped by clinging to debris. One survivor floated to shore
on a dead mule.
   The Army investigated the disaster and a captain in charge of
loading the troops at Vicksburg was found guilty of mishandling his
duties. His conviction was overturned on appeal, however, and he
was honorably discharged.

   A Soviet ocean liner with more than 950
people aboard rammed an iceberg in arctic seas and took on water
today, but all passengers were evacuated. Some crew members stayed
aboard to try to keep the ship afloat.
   A Norwegian coast guard vessel and helicopters rescued passengers
from the 630-foot Maxim Gorky and others who already had fled to
lifeboats and ice floes. Most of the passengers are Western European
vacationers.
   The cruise ship radioed northern Norway's Rescue Coordination
Center at 12:27 a.m. that it was listing after hitting an iceberg
about 300 miles east of northern Greenland, a coast guard spokesman
said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the accident occurred in fog.
   Norwegian and Soviet officials reported no injuries in the
collision. Finn B. Hansen of the Rescue Coordination Center said the
coast guard vessel arrived at 4:15 a.m. and all passengers were
rescued by about 7:30 a.m.
   Passengers said the evacuation was orderly.
   ``There was no panic at all,'' said West Germany passenger
Winfried Prince. ``The Russian crew has worked perfectly in
disembarking passengers into lifeboats, and also the Norwegians who
picked us up ... have done a wonderful job, so nobody has been hurt
or even worse,'' Prince told NBC's ``Today'' show in a
radio-telephone interview from a rescue ship.
   Hansen said the ship was apparently saved from sinking by new
pumps brought by a Soviet tugboat and a Norwegian helicopter after
others broke down. ``It looks like there is enough new pumping
equipment aboard to keep it afloat,'' he said.
   The commander of the coast guard boat Senja, Sigurd Kleiven, said
253 crewmen were being kept on board the Maxim Gorky. About 120
crewmen were rescued.
   The Senja reached the stricken ship early today and picked up
hundreds of passengers who had jumped into lifeboats or scrambled
onto ice floes in near-freezing temperatures and light rain, said
Kjell Larssen of the north Norway Rescue Center at Bodoe. Others
were rescued by helicopter from the ship or ice floes.
   Norwegian officials and the Lloyds insurance company of London
said none of the passengers were missing or injured.
   The German travel agency Phoenix Flugreisen of Bonn, which
managed the cruise, said said 551 Germans and 16 other west
Europeans were aboard and that a plane will be sent to pick them up.
   The Norwegian news agency said the passengers were from West
Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Britain, Italy, Switzerland and
Sweden.
   Tass quoted Vladimir Nekhoroshev, chief inspector for the
Ministry of the Sea Fleet, as saying 575 tourists and 377 crew
members were on board.
   The rescue center said it had received conflicting figures, but
said there were 379 crew members.
   The liner was 185 miles west of the Norway's Spitsbergen
archipelago.
   Rescue efforts were aided by the 24-hour summer daylight of the
Arctic.
   Several other Soviet and Norwegian boats were within 300 miles of
the cruise liner.
   Norwegian helicopters ferried rescued passengers from the Senja's
deck to Longyearbyen, the adminstrative center on Svalbard island,
the largest in the Spitsbergen archipelago. Airplanes were picking
them up and taking them on to the Norwegian mainland.
   The liner had originated in Bremerhaven, West Germany. It cruised
to Iceland and was to pass the Spitsbergen islands before making its
way south along the Norwegian coast on its way home, the Norwegian
news agency NTB said.
   The Maxim Gorky was built in 1969 and sold to the Soviet Union in
1974. In recent summers, it has carried mostly West Germans on tours
from Hamburg arranged by German tour operator NUR.
   The ship was crippled a few hundred miles north of where a Soviet
nuclear submarine caught fire and sank on April 7. More than 40
sailors died in that accident.
   There have been a series of recent accidents on Soviet cruise
ships.
   In February 1986, the liner Mikhail Lermontov sank off of New
Zealand after striking a reef. Of the 739 passengers and crew
aboard, all but one crew member were rescued.
   In August of that year the cruise ship Admiral Nakhimov collided
with a freighter in the Black Sea and sank, killing several hundred
Soviet tourists.
   A fire aboard the cruise ship Priamurye while it was docked in
Osaka, Japan, in May 1988 claimed the lives of 11 Soviet tourists.

   A Soviet ocean liner carrying West German
tourists rammed an iceberg in the arctic Norwegian sea and was
taking on water Tuesday. Many of the more than 900 people aboard
abandoned ship, some onto ice floes.
   The 630-foot Maxim Gorky radioed north Norway's rescue central at
12:27 a.m. that it was listing after hitting an iceberg about 185
miles west of the Norwegian island of Svalbard, said a coast guard
spokesman.
   The Soviets and Norwegians said there were no reports of
injuries. Most of the passengers were West Germans, many of them
elderly.
   The ship, located east of northern Greenland, appeared stable but
was taking on water and Norwegian officials did not know if it would
sink, the Norwegian news agency NTB said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the crew had reduced the leak
``and the situation somewhat normalized ... The Maxim Gorky is
listing slightly.''
   The Norwegian coast guard vessel Senja reached the ship early
Tuesday and began rescuing 300 to 400 passengers from lifeboats and
from ice floes in near-freezing temperatures and light rain about
two miles from the Maxim Gorky. Some 225 people and the crew were
said to still be on board.
   ``The passengers appear to be in good shape and humor ... rescue
operations are somewhat difficult because the lifeboats are near the
ice, which is moving,'' said Senja captain Kjell Tveiten via the
ship's radio.
   About 575 passengers and 377 crew members were aboard the vessel,
the Soviet Merchant Marine Emergency Preparedness office told
Norwegian state radio. Tass put the total at 953.
   Tveiten said Maxim Gorky was listing to starboard and appeared
bow-heavy but did not seem to be in immediate danger of sinking.
   Some passengers had climbed onto thick ice floes to walk to
lifeboats and rafts lowered earlier from the damaged ship into the
near-freezing waters, reports said.
   The Norwegian Defense Command said six rescue helicopters were
dispatched and would begin carrying passengers to Svalbard, about a
two-hour flight.
   Several other Soviet and Norwegian ships were within 300 miles of
the distressed ship, which was in international waters.
   Hospitals in northern Norway and on the Norwegian islands of
Spitsbergen, of which Svalbard is the largest, were on emergency
alert.
   The Svalbard hospital was awaiting Norwegian medical teams
dispatched by helicopter, said reports.
   ``Maxim Gorky'' was built in West Germany in 1969 and was sold to
the Soviet Union in 1974.
   In recent summers, the liner has carried mostly West Germans on
tours from Hamburg arranged by German tour operator NUR, news
reports said.

<LEADPARA>  'WE'RE in a race with a catastrophe," says Alan Pollock of the National
Transportation Safety Board of efforts to improve cruise vessel safety.;  
What he means, he explained, is that a cruise ship disaster would create
overwhelming pressure for new safety regulations, but he would rather take
preventive action.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SAFETY EXPERT EYES TIGHTER REGULATIONS FOR CRUISE
SHIPS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Improved cruise ship safety is on the most-wanted list at the board," he
said.;   Sadly, it is true that major steps in ship safety have followed great
disasters: The General Slocum fire, which killed 950 people in 1904, brought
tighter requirements for life-saving gear and fire-fighting equipment; the
Titanic, with its loss of 1,500 lives in 1912, brought rules on life-saving
devices and certifying of lifeboat personnel; in the '30s, the Morro Castle
fire, which cost 124 lives, and the Mohawk sinking, with a loss of 45 lives,
brought regulations on the structure, equipment and materials of passenger
ships.;   The Andrea Doria crash in 1956, in which 47 died, inspired
requirements that ship hulls be divided by steel bulkheads.;   When the
Yarmouth Castle burned and sank in 1965, taking 90 lives, Congress banned wood
construction on passenger ships. And the International Maritime Organization,
a United Nations body with headquarters in London, enacted similar regulations
when it overhauled the Safety of Life at Sea code in 1974.;   Despite these
reforms and improvements, Pollock believes the cruise ship industry has been
lucky there haven't been more fatalities during the last decade.;   "We don't
look at fatalities as a measure of safety," he said.;   "We look at the types
of accidents that occur. Things may go OK under ideal circumstances, but
accidents don't happen under ideal circumstances.";   Pollock fears that
Congress, the Coast Guard and the International Maritime Organization are not
moving fast enough to mandate safeguards, despite 176 deaths last year in an
arsonist's fire on the Scandinavian Star ferry in Denmark, and the dramatic
images of the cruise ship Oceanos, which sank off South Africa early in
August, fortunately without loss of life.;   Safety experts are primarily
concerned with three issues: fire protection, particularly in the big atria of
new cruise ships, the ability of crew members to give safety instructions in a
language that passengers understand, and the aging of the world fleet of
cruise ships.;   American passengers frequently assume that any ship they
board in a U.S. port has met all Coast Guard safety requirements, a notion
reinforced by "Coast Guard approved" labels on most life jackets, and fire
systems on smaller boats and domestic ferries.;   In fact, the Coast Guard
gives four inspections a year to ships that dock in the United States, but
when the vessel is registered in another country, the Coast Guard only makes
sure the ship provides whatever is required by international Safety of Life at
Sea regulations: twice as many lifeboat seats as potential passengers and life
jackets for 125 percent of capacity, with the equipment in good condition.;  
Once a year, the Coast Guard observes an evacuation drill. If equipment is not
in order, the Coast Guard can prevent the boarding of passengers until things
are up to snuff.;   The application of the rules is not universal: the older
the vessel, the less stringent the requirements, because Safety of Life at Sea
rules have grandfather clauses.;   Age: no automatic alarm;   A vessel need
comply only with the rules in effect at the time the keel was laid or it last
underwent major reconstruction. When the rules were initially adopted by the
International Maritime Organization, it was assumed that older vessels would
pass out of service, but this did not happen, according to Marjorie Murtagh of
the Coast Guard, the U.S. fire-safety representative at the International
Maritime Organization.;   Of the 100 large vessels now operating from U.S.
ports -- all but two are of foreign registry -- 72 are more than 10 years old,
23 are more than 20 years old and 26 are more than 30 years old, according to
figures in the Coast Guard magazine Proceedings of the Marine Safety Council.
Thus, 70 percent of vessels visiting the United States need not meet the most
recent international rules, enacted in 1974 to cover ships built after May
1980.;   However, everyone who deals with these figures points out that age is
not an automatic indicator of an unsafe vessel. For instance, the Britanis was
built in 1932 of a steel design not required until after the Andrea Doria.;  
Rear Adm. Joel D. Sipes, former chief of the Coast Guard's Office of Marine
Safety, testified in Congress this spring: "We have been concerned for a
number of years that the grandfather clauses create an incentive to bring more
and more older ships back into service. We already see an aging of the fleet,
and a resurgence in refurbishment without safety upgrading.";   Death rate
falls;   However, the casualty rate on cruise ships has been low in recent
years. The National Transportation Safety Board in 1989 published a study of
36 accidents in 15 years on vessels that touched U.S. ports. Of the 176 deaths
listed, only five were aboard ocean-going cruise vessels under foreign flags.;
  William A. O'Neil, secretary general of the International Maritime
Organization, fears that may change, partly because of the leeway the
grandfather rules give for refitting. "The average age of ships today is 16
years, which is already fairly elderly in shipping terms and old ships need
more maintenance and repair," he said in a statement last month.;   In May,
the safety committee of the International Maritime Organization met in London
to begin amending the Safety of Life at Sea rules.;   The proposed amendments,
which are supported by the majority of the member countries, require that new
ships' atriums have smoke-detection systems, smoke-exhaust systems, two means
of escape and an automatic sprinkler system.;   The committee also discussed a
phase-out of the grandfather rules. One peculiar gap in existing regulations
involves vessels built under the 1974 rules, which banned wood construction,
but for the first time did not require sprinkler systems.;   These vessels
would probably be among the first existing vessels required to install
sprinklers.;   Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the United States have entered
proposals to cover older vessels immediately, or to modify sharply the
permissive rules. Roger Kohn, information officer for the maritime
organization in London, said the loss of the Oceanos "tended to confirm a
general feeling that something must be done.";   John T. Estes, president of
the International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents the owners of most
of the ocean-going cruise vessels, said that his organization favored all the
proposed new rules, but not the proposed effective dates.;   When the safety
committee met in May, it was considering phasing-in dates for the regulations
beyond 1994 for new ships, possibly as late as 2010 for removal from service
of vessels that cannot meet the new rules.;   Estes said that accounting for
the lead time required for ship design, his organization favors 1996 for
enforcing the rules on new construction and major reconstruction.;   The 15
major cruise ships that call in New York have passed inspections without
difficulty, according to Comdr. Anthony Dupree, chief of the inspection
department of the Coast Guard in New York. In U.S. ports, he said, any work is
generally done quickly "because passengers are the lines' meat and potatoes,
and we can keep them from boarding.";   These inspections, done every three
months, should assure passengers, according to Lieut. Comdr. John J. O'Brien
Jr., the Coast Guard's deputy chief.;   "If you fly to another country to save
a few dollars," he said, "let the buyer beware; you don't know if it's been
inspected in the last year, or at all.";   On the other hand, when
U.S.-registered vessels are inspected, O'Brien said, they are required to meet
full Coast Guard standards, including expensive Type I life vests designed to
be very easy to use. But there are only two U.S.-flag vessels in the cruise
trade -- American Hawaii Cruises' Independence and Constitution, operating in
Hawaii.  </TEXT>

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Titanic Memories: Letter From an 11-Year-Old </HL>
<AUTHOR> Nicholas King, Falls Church, Va. </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   The folded sheet of pale gray writing paper bore the red-and-white pennant of the White Star Line over the words, in dark blue, "On board R.M.S. 'Titanic,'" and the date was April 10, 1912. 

   Below, the space was filled with a child's loops and swoops and misspellings in pencil. 
"Dear Lusia," it began -- the writer meant Louisa -- and it went on to describe "the biggest ship in the world, with its gymnasium, its swimming pool and its Turkish baths." 

   Then the 11-year-old girl who wrote it told how the Titanic, outward bound from its berth in Southampton on its maiden voyage to New York, ran afoul of the cables of another ship, the Olympic. 
It soon got clear and proceeded into the English Channel. 
"It's quite calm now," she wrote innocently, "No one has been sick so far." 

   The letter belongs to Eileen Schefer, a distinguished and self-possessed 86-year-old Englishwoman who has lived here for many years, the widow of retired diplomat and school director Edward Schefer. 
Her abode is a yellow-and-white farmhouse, an anachronism in this densely populated Washington suburb, set in an acre of old trees and enclosed by a wooden paddock fence and beyond it by rows of small brick dwellings in geometric plots. 
The house is filled with graceful Victorian furniture and family portraits in gilt oval frames, as remote from its surroundings as the Titanic would be from the life of the ocean today. 

   But there seems to be a mystery. 
The lady is a survivor of the Titanic, of which there were some and are now still a few. 
But who ever saw a letter from on board that survived? 
Women and children may have been rescued, but no one ever heard of a mail sack being dumped into the life boats. 
How did Mrs. Schefer come to be sitting in her house in Falls Church with the letter she wrote 76 years ago in her hand? 

   What happened was that the letter was taken off the Titanic at the Irish port of Cobh or Queenstown, where transatlantic liners used to stop for that purpose. 
Eileen Lenox-Conyngham, as she then was, and her mother, an aunt and her younger brother, Dennis, went on to France, where they disembarked at Cherbourg, the traditional port of call for British liners, five hours after they left Southampton. 

   Because the Lenox-Conynghams had no luggage to unpack or worry about other than what was needed for a brief vacation, they had time to roam over the ship, hence Eileen's vivid memory of it. 
"The maiden-voyage flowers were beautiful; The officers and deckhands very kind to us." 

   A few days later, after the family visited Chartres, Eileen was horrified, on her arrival in Paris, to see huge headlines announcing the fateful news. 
"Le Roi des Vaissaux Blesse a Mort" said one of them -- "The Monarch of Ships Mortally Wounded." 

   The Louisa of the letter was the family's young nursery maid in their home in Suffolk, where the Rev. George Lenox-Conyngham, Eileen's father, had a parish. 
Louisa later married the gardener, and it was their daughter, Patricia Kent, now 62 and a widow too, who found the long-forgotten document among some family papers. 
She was told it was valuable -- it was indeed: It sold at auction last fall for $1,700 and was bought on Mrs. Schefer's behalf by her nephew. 
She and her son wonder if it should not be framed in double glass (it is temporarily safe in an acetate folder) so the whole thing can be seen. 

   Mrs. Schefer has been in touch with the Titanic Historical Society, which is planning a reunion of survivors in Boston in September. 
The society has invited her and her son Anton to be present and they are looking forward to it. 

   There is one question left: Why did the Lenox-Conynghams embark on such an enormous vessel as the Titanic merely to cross the Channel? 
"Well you see," Mrs. Schefer says, "we were very poor sailors and easily got seasick. 
My father thought that if only the ship were big enough we couldn't have too rough a trip."

<TEXT>
   At least 179 people who abandoned a
ship sunk by Typhoon Ruby swam or rode lifeboats for hours in
mountainous seas to reach safety on small islands, officials said
Thursday.
   The Dona Marilyn sank Monday with more than 500 people aboard.
   The discovery of survivors on remote islands lifted the hopes of
rescue workers, who have found the bodies of at least 32 people.
Other reports put the death toll at 26.
   Carlos Go, president of the shipping company that owned the Dona
Marilyn, said 138 of the survivors had been put aboard another
company vessel and were expected to arrive in Tacloban Thursday.
   Others remained on small islands near where the 2,855-ton Dona
Marilyn sank. The vessel was on a Manila-Tacloban run when it sank
in heavy seas and high winds about 300 miles southeast of the
capital.
   Go said he hoped more survivors would be found.
   ``There are plenty of islands in the area,'' and the search was
continuing Thursday, he said.
   Survivors told how people rushed into lifeboats or dived
overboard as the vessel heaved in storm-whipped seas and sank.
   In Manila, people jammed the offices of Sulpicio Lines, which
owned the ship, seeking information about relatives who were aboard.
   Virginia Tamban, whose sister and two nieces were passengers,
said she would remain overnight to see if their names appeared on
the list of survivors. ``I hope they are safe,'' she sobbed. She
said none of them knew how to swim.
   Raymundo Adejer, 27, said his sister, Natividad, and her
4-year-old son were on the vessel, although the boy's name was not
on the manifest.
   ``I cannot blame anyone for this except the captain of the ship
who still sailed despite reports that a storm was coming up,''
Adejer said.
   President Corazon Aquino on Wednesday declared a state of
calamity in Manila and 35 provinces hardest hit by Typhoon Ruby.
   The Red Cross and other relief agencies said 114 people were
killed on land by the typhoon, which pummeled the entire archipelago
nation with heavy rains and winds Monday and Tuesday before heading
west toward China.
   The Red Cross said more than 765,000 Filipinos were affected by
Ruby, meaning their homes were destroyed, damaged or flooded or
sustained other losses. The government said the storm caused $45
million in damage to crops and destroyed $7.5 million worth of roads
and bridges.
   Bernardo Cabigon, Sulpicio's station manager in Tacloban, quoted
surviving crewmembers of the Dona Marilyn as saying they briefly
tried to pump water from the ship as it listed to one side.
   ``After they found out they could not do anything anymore, they
decided to get off,'' he said. ``Everybody was jumping into the sea.
Others took the lifeboats. But there were so many people that they
decided to jump and swim. They looked very tired. They stayed in the
water for three hours.''
   Cabigon quoted survivors as saying that some passengers were so
frightened they claimed they saw an island nearby and swam toward
it, although the storm had reduced visibility to nearly zero at the
time.
   He quoted survivor Alberto Oledo as saying he jumped overboard
with his wife, son and daughter. The three held hands but were
separated in the raging seas, and Oledo was the only who reached
land.
   Cabigon said 120 of the 179 survivors managed to reach the remote
island of Almagro in lifejackets and life boats.
   Go said 26 bodies were recovered, but the Coast Guard put the
figure at 32. There was no explanation for the discrepancy.
   The Dona Marilyn was trying to maneuver to the western side of
Masbate island, away from Ruby's approach to the east, but was
buffeted by strong waves and winds of up to 140 mph, Cabigon said.
   The coast guard said the skipper reported the vessel listing to
the port side in heavy seas in a radio distress signal before the
ship went down.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters she ordered an investigation of the
sinking. ``I'm telling (the transportation minister) to investigate
this and find out why they still sailed during very bad weather.''
   Go said he could not explain why the vessel sailed Sunday,
despite the approach of the typhoon, because he was unable to
interview surviving crew members.
   In December, another Sulpicio ship, the Dona Paz, collided with
an oil tanker off Mindoro island. The official death toll was 1,749,
but other estimates said more than 3,000 were killed. Only 28 people
survived.

<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard's failure to require life
rafts and signal beacons on small, commercial passenger boats
contributed to the loss of life in the sinking of a vessel off the
Oregon coast, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded
Tuesday.
   It was the first time the board has cited what it considers a
laxity in Coast Guard regulations as a contributory cause to an
accident it investigated.
   The board, on a 3-0 vote with one member absent, placed primary
blame for the accident on the vessel's captain, who was not
identified.
   The board also blamed the Coast Guard for failing in its
inspections to confirm whether hatchcovers on the 46-foot Cougar
were watertight before the Sept. 15, 1988, sinking, which led to
the deaths of the boat's captain, a deckhand and two passengers.
   One died 15 minutes before a helicopter rescued a ship's mate
and the boat's four remaining passengers, who had floated in the
cold water 35 miles west of Depoe Bay for 18 hours, investigators
said.
   The board said the Cougar's captain had failed to ensure that
hatchcovers were watertight, that the bilge pump was operating
properly and that rubber flaps designed to let water flow off the
deck were correctly installed.
   The flaps were on the wrong side, preventing water from flowing
off the deck, investigators said. The ship sank in moderately heavy
seas while returning from a fishing trip, after its crew and
passengers tried for 90 minutes to bail out the ship with buckets.
   The board estimates that more than 4,700 commercial vessels
capable of carrying 300,000 passengers fall under the same
regulations as the Cougar.
   The board for years has recommended that the Coast Guard require
all commercial boats to carry lifeboats that will keep all
passengers and crew out of the water if the ship sinks and that
emergency positon-indicating radio beacons, or EPRIBs, be carried
on all vessels so they can be quickly located by searchers.
   In the last five years, the board has investigated five
passenger vessel accidents, including two collisions, one fire, one
capsizing and one grounding. In each case, Coast Guard survival
craft requirements were found inadequate, but there has been no
change.
   The board recommended that the Coast Guard require that within
five years all floation devices and buoyant apparatus be replaced
by lifeboats, life rafts or inflatable devices that can keep people
out of the water.
   The problem is that floatation devices require that passengers
remain in the water, where they can suffer from a rapid loss of
body heat, or hypothermia.
   The board also advised the Coast Guard to improve its testing
rules and procedures and to require all passenger vessel operators
to file sailing plans before they set out.

   The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler
Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic, and the
muddy Mississippi River coughed up burned and bloated bodies for
weeks afterward.
   But until Sunday, no memorial had been created in this onetime
Confederate stronghold for the Union soldiers who perished aboard
the steamship, many of them emaciated survivors of Confederate
prison camps during the Civil War.
   Before a small crowd of about 50 people, a 6-foot granite marker
was unveiled in Memphis' Elmwood Cemetery as a reminder that the
Sultana went down in flames just seven miles north of the city's
downtown riverfront.
   Built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76, the paddlewheeler was
carrying more than 2,300 people, in addition to 100 horses and
mules, when three of its four boilers exploded at 2 a.m. on April
27, 1865, less than three weeks after the end of the war.
   Most of the more than 1,500 people who died had recently been
freed from prison camps in Alabama and were headed north to be
released from the Army. Many were crowded onto two decks directly
over the paddlewheeler's 18-foot boilers, one of which had
developed a leak and been hastily repaired.
   When one of the boilers blew, setting off two others, the upper
decks collapsed, forming a funnel that dumped dozens of the victims
into the fire, said Hugh Berryman, a forensic pathologist at the
University of Tennessee in Memphis.
   Jerry Potter, a Memphis lawyer who has researched the disaster
for a dozen years and is writing a book on it, said Union officers
may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport
payments.
   ``There were two other steamboats that were trying to get a
portion of the men. The only explanation I have been able to
uncover for why the Sultana got them all is bribery,'' Potter said.
   Potter and Berryman estimated the Sultana death toll at 1,547.
By comparison, 1,503 lives were lost when the ocean liner Titanic
hit an iceberg and sank in the remote North Atlantic in 1912.
   Other counts of the Sultana victims have put the total between
1,400 and 1,450, but Berryman said those estimates failed to
include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded the boat at
Vicksburg, Miss.
   ``Our figure is probably a conservative one,'' Berryman said.
   The Sultana monument, financed by three Memphis residents, will
be the second of two major markers to the disaster.
   The other, in Knoxville, Tenn., was put up in 1916 by Sultana
survivors who raised money for the monument themselves.
   Researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers
of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln two weeks earlier and with the end of the war,
Berryman said.
   ``It was just lost to history because of the other events that
were going on at the time,'' Berryman said.

FT  15 APR 92 / Messages from the Titanic fetch Pounds 95,000

CHRISTIE'S South Kensington raised Pounds 95,000 (against a Pounds 30,000
estimate) for a collection of 448 messages which were sent and received by
the Titanic, the luxury liner which sank in the North Atlantic on her maiden
voyage in 1912.
The top price was the Pounds 66,000 (estimate Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 10,000)
paid by a telephone bidder for 85 signals sent and received by the Titanic
between April 12 and April 15, the morning she hit the iceberg that sank
her.
There was keen bidding for a 10-page letter by Harold Bride, a Marconi
wireless operator on board the ship, describing his experiences, which sold
for Pounds 8,250 (eight times its target). Another item that attracted
interest was a letter put up for sale by Eva Hart, one of the few survivors
still alive, which was given by her father, who went down with the ship, to
her mother, who was saved.
Christie's had been excited by the appearance of a previously unknown album
containing more than 50 drawings by Henry Fuseli. Its excitement was
justified - the album doubled its estimate at almost Pounds 750,000. The top
price was the Pounds 55,000 paid for a pen-and-pencil drawing of 'The
Massacre of the Innocents'.
The morning auction of Old Master drawings did well, totalling Pounds
687,764 and 94 per cent sold. A pastel of Princess Radziwill, painted in
1801 by Louise-Elizabeth Vigee le-Brun, just about doubled its estimate
fetching about Pounds 50,600.
The surprise of the auction was the Pounds 38,500 paid for a study of arms
attributed to the Circle of Michaelangelo. Its estimate had been Pounds
5,000. Obviously, the buyer believed it to be by the the master.

<F P=106> [Tatyana Smolyakova report: "Ecology: "Patches for the </F>
Submarine"] 
  [Text] In accordance with a presidential directive and a 
Russian Federation Government decree a routine expedition to the 
area where the Komsomolets nuclear submarine sank five years ago 
in the Norwegian Sea will go ahead 15 June through 15 August. 
The voyage is to be carried out under the direction of Russia's 
Ministry for Emergency Situations with the participation of a 
number of Russian Academy of Sciences research institutes, the 
"Rubin" maritime technology central design bureau, and the 
Defense Ministry. 
  We would remind you that there are an atomic reactor and two 
torpedoes with nuclear warheads aboard the submarine. The 
torpedoes pose the greatest potential danger: Each of them 
contains 3,200 grams of plutonium-239. Since the nose section 
of the submarine has been damaged seabed currents could destroy 
the torpedoes' casings. And then radioactive contamination of 
the water is inevitable. According to the most pessimistic 
estimates, this could happen in late-1995 or early-1996. And 
although most scientists and specialists do not share such a 
pessimistic forecast, they all agree that it is better to play 
safe. That is the purpose of the expedition. 
  There are three specific tasks -- to hermetically seal the 
nose section of the Komsomolets nuclear submarine using special 
titanium "patches," monitor the radiation and environmental 
situation in the area, investigate the technical state of the 
submarine, and search for the rescue chamber. 
  A collegium session was held at the Ministry for Emergency 
Situations to examine the preparations for the expedition. It 
was acknowledged that the work is proceeding on schedule. The 
titanium "patches" have already been brought aboard the 
oceanographic ship Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. The intention is 
to fit them to the submarine using manned "Mir" underwater craft 
equipped with mechanical arms. In mid-June the ship will leave 
Kaliningrad, go to St. Petersburg and then to Denmark and 
Norway, and start the actual scientific program 1 July in the 
area of the wreck of the Komsomolets. The preparation of a 
warship to ship freight and members of the expedition from 
Murmansk to the work area is being completed. Another 
oceanographic vessel has been chartered in Murmansk as backup 
for the operation. 
  During the coming voyage particular attention will be paid 
to 
environmental monitoring. Unique self-contained equipment will 
be set up in the area where the submarine sank from which 
readings can be taken regarding the state of the environment 
without the equipment's being removed from the water. This is 
extremely important in order to gain a precise knowledge of the 
situation and precisely forecast how it will develop. 
  The fact that hitherto monitoring has been by no means 
perfect has given rise to a mass of speculation over the problem 
of the Komsomolets. For instance, there has been plenty of 
supposition that the fishing catch may be contaminated as a 
result of a plutonium leak. 
  In theory that possibility is not ruled out. It is known 
that the plankton on which the fish feed spend the winter at a 
depth of 1,000 meters. Sometimes they go down to a depth of 
1,500 meters and very small quantities as far as 2,000 meters. 
We would remind you that the Komsomolets is lying at a depth of 
1,700 meters. Thus, there is a likelihood of the plankton and 
then the fish being subjected to radioactive contamination. But 
how great is it? That also has to be ascertained using the 
state-of-the-art monitoring apparatus, some of which has been 
developed by Russian specialists, some by foreigners. 
  What is more, one of the tasks facing the 1994 expedition is 
to rehearse the technologies for emergency and monitoring work 
in extraordinary situations in the oceans of the world. 
  This program will cost Russian taxpayers 4.625 billion 
rubles 
and [as published] $4.1 million. But evidently this expenditure 
is worth it in order to prevent a possible nuclear catastrophe 
and stop speculation over the problem.

<LEADPARA>  Passengers from a Greek cruise ship that sank in stormy seas off South Africa
said today that the captain and crew abandoned the vessel while hundreds of
people were still on board.;    The ship's owner today defended the crew

board lifeboats as the liner Oceanos sank Sunday about a mile offshore. But
the company said they were needed to help the passengers aboard and assist
them onto rescue vessels.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Capt. Yiannis Avranas also defended his decision to be among the first to
leave the ship, saying it was necessary to direct rescue operations from
shore.;    "I don't care what these people say about me. I am separated from
my family, who were rescued by one of the other ships, and I lost my own ship
-- what more do they want?" he asked.;    The South African air force said all
361 passengers were safe, but officials were still trying to determine the
fate of four missing crew members.;    More than 570 people were rescued by
military helicopters, cargo ships and other vessels Sunday, air force Maj.
Gerrie Evert said.;    Search operations were continuing; however, the missing
four may be on two ships that helped in the rescue but had not been contacted,
officials said. "We haven't seen any bodies in the water," Evert said.;   
Transport Ministry officials were investigating claims that many of the crew
were among the first to abandon the Durban-bound ship.;    Passengers claimed
crew members took the ship's only two motorized lifeboats, leaving passengers
to try to launch regular motorless lifeboats.;    "They left us in the lurch.
They knew . . . that the ship was going to sink and didn't say a thing," said
passenger Kevin Ellis. "All the crew who knew how to operate lifeboats had
gone.";    Stephanie Hankinson, the ship's photographer, said the crew's
departure created havoc: "They left, and there was a total state of panic
because nobody else knew how to let the lifeboats down.";    Employees and
entertainers of the South African tour company that rented the Oceanos
reportedly took over, launching lifeboats and helping people who were
airlifted to safety by helicopters.;    A spokesman for Epirotiki Lines, the
owner of the ship, said crew members played a critical role in the evacuation,
which he said went according to plan.;    "The fact that the operation was so
successful with all on board saved proves that the rescue plan was the correct
one," the spokesman, Capt. Alevizos Klaudatos, said in Athens.;    Terrified
passengers waited for help all night on the ship's upper deck. As the ship
began to list, some leaped overboard, Evert said.;    One man was rescued
after 10 hours in the water, eight miles from where the ship sank, said Air
Force Maj. Andres Steenkamp.;    The last people on board were rescued at
midday Sunday -- only 90 minutes before the Oceanos sank.;    Military
officials said they did not know why the ship began taking on water but that
its proximity to shore suggested it may have hit a reef off the dangerous
"Wild Coast.";    The captain said a piston in the engine room burst, knocking
a hole in the hull.;    The ship foundered when its engine room was flooded
and began listing heavily after it was battered by waves up to 24 feet high.; 
  Transport Minister P.J. Welgemoed said his department would investigate a
report that harbor officials in East London received a bomb threat about 24
hours before the vessel began taking on water.;    Police Maj. Gen. Johan Rust
said police went to the investigate but were denied access by Captain Avranas.
Rust said ship security officials reported finding no evidence of a bomb.;   
Ship officials denied Avranas would not allow authorities on board to search.;
   The 7,554-ton Oceanos -- 495 feet long and 64 feet wide -- was carrying
mostly South African passengers.;    In the rescue operation, military
helicopters airlifted more than 200 people off the ship, and 300 were pulled
from the sea or from life rafts. Planes dropped life preservers to people in
the water, and many people were saved by three merchant ships that rushed to
the scene.;    It had left the Indian Ocean port Saturday on the return leg of
a Durban-Cape Town-Durban cruise. It sank off Coffee Bay, part of the Transkei
black homeland.  </TEXT>

   A freighter carrying a cargo of
beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine
crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman
said.
   The ship sank at about 12:45 p.m. in high winds, some 28
nautical miles north of the island of Ameland.
   It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29
miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard
spokesman, who was not identified. There were no casualties, he
said.
   The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview,
identified the ship involved as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra
and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer. He did not give the
ship's origin or destination.
   The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking
in high winds. They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter
from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the
sinking, the official said.
   A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the
scene.
   Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry,
possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes
between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland.
   Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its
vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in
West Germany.
