<TEXT>     While Mr. Fender did not invent the electric guitar, he did revolutionize
and perfect it. Called both the Henry Ford and the Thomas Edison of the
instrument, Mr. Fender's solid-body guitars and amplifiers set the industry
standard for excellence.;    "Fender was a phenomenon," said Peter Schuelzky,
general manager of the Guitar Center in Hollywood. "He created the guitar (to)
which all other manufacturers try to conform. . . . Nobody has been quite as
successful.";    Electric guitars made Mr. Fender, a tinkerer and inventor by
nature, a millionaire.;    In 1954, he created the Stratocaster, a
revolutionary instrument hailed as a near-perfect fusion of electronics,
ergonomics and technology on one side, and design and aesthetics on the
other.;    "The Stratocaster is like the Rolls-Royce," said Dick Dale, 53,
known as "king of the surf guitar" for pioneering the surf rock sound in
Southern California in the late-1950s and early '60s. "It can never be
surpassed."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  PLAYING a Fender guitar is somewhat like driving a very powerful car,
preferably American-made -- perhaps a 1967 Corvette.;    In the case of the
three-pickup Stratocaster model, you find that this sculpted piece of wood
with two curved teeth by the fingerboard -- an instrument built for Batman --
fits the human body surprisingly well. After you've plugged it into an
amplifier (perhaps a Fender Twin Reverb from the late '60s), you suddenly are
capable of producing the most alarming . . . sound.  </LEADPARA>

THE ENGINEER OF ROCK 'N' ROLL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Pop Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Such was the legacy of Clarence Leo Fender, the force behind one of the
century's enduring American artifacts -- the solid-body electric guitar. If
rock 'n' roll was invented by Robert Johnson, Elvis Presley and Little
Richard, it was Fender and his company who launched the music's true machine.;
   Purists will argue that Fender, a Fullerton resident who died last month at
82, was not the first to make such a device. Claims are made for the
Rickenbacker company, and for the remarkable Les Paul, who also produced music
from a solid piece of wood in the 1940s (eventually manufactured by Fender's
American arch-rival, the Gibson Corp.). Acoustic guitars had been electrified
for jazz since the 1930s, and perhaps before.;    It was Fender's genius,
though, to mass-produce the solid-wood design that not only made the raucous,
reverberating sounds of rock, but also managed to look the part.;    Like
Levi's and Coca-Cola, the Stratocaster and its more basic cousin, the
Telecaster swept the world in the early '50s. Both have since been copied and
recopied by just about every guitar maker from New York to South Korea. But if
their design can be found everywhere, nothing has quite duplicated the spirit
of the originals.;    Tom Wheeler, in his encyclopedic book "American
Guitars," perfectly catches their visual audacity: "Fender guitars were rock
and roll, jet-age, outrageous. They were as futuristic as Sputnik, or as tacky
as all the sequins in Webb Pierce's wardrobe, depending on your point of view.
Before Fender, there were no turquoise musical instruments, no Candy Apple
Red, scoop-body dragsters with gold-plated hardware and white plastic knobs.";
   Fender's creations became not only the sound of rock 'n' roll, but its
history. Such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Holly and Eric Clapton became
inseparable from their Stratocasters (and, in some cases, from their onstage
demolition of them.);    Inevitably, anyone who admired these Strat players
(or Telecaster players such as Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards and Danny
Gatton) would want to own such odd-looking, interesting instruments -- and
would treasure them.;    It is a wonderful aural coincidence that the words
Strad and Strat sound so much alike: A violinist will talk about his
Stradivarius with the same reverence that a rock guitarist will speak about
his Stratocaster.;    The father of the Strat was no great fan of rock.
Rather, Fender was fascinated by the way you could get sounds by placing
magnets under the metal strings of guitars.;    He experimented with coils of
different sizes and impedances -- more intrigued, perhaps, by capacitors than
by harmonies. He held dozens of patents, and so much attention was lavished on
his guitars that one could overlook the fact he made the world's first
electric bass in 1951 -- an instrument that also changed pop music forever.;  
 With astounding understatement, he once said, "I never had too much feeling
for the acoustic guitars. I had always felt that the guitar could do a much
better job if it wasn't limited by the properties of that vibrating top.";   
For him, the combinations of sound, once you were freed from the acoustic
limit, seemed infinite. With a revolutionary three pickups (the Stratocaster
version; Telecasters had only two) and the proper amplifier, musicians could
fill a large room. With enough amplification, they would discover soon enough,
their devices could fill a stadium.;    But even a beginner learns that with a
little experimentation, a mere flick of the wrist, the Fender sound can be
sustained, or vibrated -- and cranked up. It can be turned into Hendrix-like
feedback or Stevie Ray Vaughan-like blues or the B.B. King-like solos on those
Rolling Stones albums.;    This is not a guitar for "Michael, Row the Boat
Ashore." Even on the first test drive, you can imagine it assaulting Jericho's
walls.;    In time, caught in the entropy of our century, things went
downhill. Fender sold the company to CBS in 1965, and since then connoisseurs
of Strats and Teles have looked for the phrase "pre-CBS" whenever one was
sold.;    Guitars that were traded routinely for under $200 in the 1950s and
early 1960s suddenly were going for thousands.;    "Fender Stratocaster, 1957,
Sunburst, Been Through Hell. $5,000" is still a typical advertisement.
Eventually, the unthinkable happened: Fenders were made in Japan. Some still
are, although the company's present owners again are making them in the United
States.;    Fender himself, the man Wheeler calls the "Henry Ford of electric
guitars," continued to build them. He founded G &amp; L Musical Products, and many
G &amp; L instruments are much prized.;    By most accounts, Fender was outwardly
the perfect nerd, absorbed by mechanical things until the end. "He rarely
wears a suit, and he's almost never without his little leather holster full of
screwdrivers," said a long-ago profile in Guitar Player. "In his shirt, he
keeps a plastic pocket protector stuffed with pens, pencils and a metal
ruler.";    He never learned to play the guitar. (box)  </TEXT>

   Minutes after mesmerizing an audience with
his electric guitar wizardry, rocker Eric Johnson is shyly greeting
fans and signing autographs.
   He talks with such humility and kindness that it's a tossup
which is more enchanting: the music he makes on stage or his boyish
friendliness backstage.
   Underneath the good humor lies a demanding perfectionism in a
musician on a quest for a brand-new sound from his '54 Fender
Stratocaster.
   ``The older I get, the more I listen to the guitar and go: `Oh
God. I need a new turn-on. It's got to do something more. Is this
all?''' Johnson said in an interview. ``You can get a screechy,
nervous, jittery sound out of the electric guitar and it's like,
gah, it's got to go farther now.
   ``I'm trying to figure out a way. I want it to be real
rocked-out-and-buzz guitar, but I want it to have a little elegance
to it. And in its real Neanderthal, paleolithic way, I want it to
have a tuxedo on.''
   Elegance isn't a word often tied to the electric guitar. But
Johnson was schooled in classical piano and he's found ways to
bring the two together.
   ``I try to listen to more classical music because of the chord
changes and the breadth of the music. To me, classical in a way is
the most unassuming music,'' Johnson said.
   Johnson, 35, first hit the Austin music scene in the 1970s at
age 15, mystifying musicians with his electric guitar mastery that
evoked images of rock revolutionary Jimi Hendrix.
   The late Stevie Ray Vaughan was among those awed by his talent.
Vaughan once said that by the time Johnson reached his late teens,
he was so advanced it was difficult for him to find musicians to
keep up with him.
   Johnson's solo debut album, ``Tones,'' earned him a 1986 Grammy
nomination for ``Best Instrumental of the Year'' for the track
``Zap.'' However, the album had little commercial success.
   Nearly four years later, Johnson has poured his heart and
experience into a new album, ``Ah Via Musicom'' on Capitol Records.
The album and its rich instrumental ``Cliffs of Dover'' have
received favorable response and substantial play on album-only rock
radio stations.
   Johnson said the album has changed his audiences from the
musicians-only crowd to the fickle radio listeners eternally
searching for a new sound and new star.
   Some of the credit must go to Capitol Records, which has heavily
promoted the album, Johnson said.
   But the album also is the embodiment of what makes Johnson
great, his tireless perfectionism and insatiable search for a
different sound.
   ``I spent two months solid working on `Tones.' I spent 15 months
on this last record, not solid but close to it. I just did it over
and over and over, trying to figure out a way to get the guitar
tone like I wanted it,'' he said.
   According to Capitol Records, Johnson recorded ``Ah Via
Musicom'' three times with two bass players, Kyle Brock and Roscoe
Beck; three drummer-percussionists, Tommy Taylor, James Ferner and
Paul Bissell; and several arrangements.
   Brock, who has played with Johnson 20 years, and Taylor,
formerly a drummer for Christopher Cross, are traveling with
Johnson. The three joined rock guitarist Joe Satriani in California
in late September for three weeks of concerts on the West Coast.
   ``I like to think Eric's music is the music we're all involved
in,'' Taylor said. ``It's something a little promising and offers a
little alternative. So much of the music you hear is very
predictable. There's a freshness about what Eric does.''
   What Johnson eternally seeks from his guitar and amplifiers and
electronic gizmos is what musician's call ``tone.''
   ``Tone is the colors you put together to create a certain hue of
sound of a particular instrument - the way you play the instrument,
the emotion you put behind it, the technique, phrasing, all the
things that are elements of your art or your music that create a
sound,'' he said.
   Johnson chooses to search for tone with more conventional
amplifiers and foot pedals from the '60s and '70s that lack the
computer chips found in today's equipment.
   In his live performances, he spreads a buffet of pedals before
his feet. While his fingers dance over the frets of his guitar, his
feet skip between the pedals, producing an energetic, intellectual
sound.
   ``There's kind of this side of me that treats it (the music)
like a laboratory where I work in the studio or I work in my
practice house and fiddle with all sorts of electronics and stuff,
trying to make the guitar sound better,'' Johnson said.
   ``I don't mean that with a negative connotation, but you play
for 20 years and it's the same old guitar sound. At this point, I'm
not reinventing the guitar, I don't have a whole new sound or
anything, but I'm trying to figure out a way to hone and perfect
the electrical guitar sound.''

   Every other month, cemetery workers tending Jimi
Hendrix's grave replace the lawn worn away by fans.
   Every day they take away the offerings left near his granite
marker the night before: marijuana butts, lighters, guitar picks.
   Twenty years after Woodstock _ and 19 years after Hendrix _
admirers still come to sit and think about the young man who helped
define psychedelic rock.
   When Hendrix cranked up his Fender Stratocaster, the Earth
became ``The Third Stone From the Sun,'' and a nation of rebellious
youth grooved to ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   When he hit Woodstock in August 1969, his music and his career
were soaring. A year and a month later they crashed.
   He died in his sleep Sept. 18, 1970, while on a European tour.
The coroner's report said he choked on his own vomit. The trace of
barbituates in his blood was small, not enough to kill, the coroner
said.
   Hendrix was born in Seattle in 1942. He left Garfield High
School after his junior year to join the Army because he didn't
want to spend another summer mowing the lawns for his father's
landscape business.
   ``He wanted one of those screaming eagles on his shoulder,''
said James A. ``Al'' Hendrix, referring to the patch worn by
paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division.
   Hendrix served after Korea and before Vietnam, when lyrics from
his songs would be scribbled on soldiers' helmets.
   He went by Jimmy in those days and was shy, his father said. The
shortened name and stage antics, such as squirting lighter fluid on
his burning guitar, were just show business he adopted later.
   ``He was a good boy,'' the 70-year-old Hendrix said. ``He played
Little League, football, swimming. We called him `Buster' 'til he
was 9 or 10. Then he wanted to be called Jimmy.''
   Jimmy and his younger brother, Leon, were raised by their
father. His parents were divorced and his mother died when he was
10.
   The family's console record player filled the rooming house
where they lived with B.B. King and Muddy Waters, and young Jimmy
mimicked the records, using a broom for a guitar.
   ``I had this old ukelele from one of my jobs,'' said his father,
a former musician in Vancouver, British Columbia. ``I gave it to
him. Of course he couldn't get much music out of it.''
   So Al Hendrix paid a friend $5 for his acoustic guitar and gave
it to Jimmy. The first electric guitar was bought at a music shop
along with a saxophone for dad. When they fell behind on payments,
the sax went back, but the electric guitar stayed.
   ``I told him he'd go farther with that guitar than I would with
the sax,'' Hendrix said with a laugh. ``I never did get him an amp.
He used to plug into his friends'. Still, he got music out of it.
The Peter Gunn theme was one of the first things I remember him
playing.''
   Hendrix didn't return to Seattle when a back injury from a
parachute jump ended his military career. Instead, he headed East
in search of the music scene, and played in backup bands for the
Supremes, the Isley Brothers and Little Richard.
   Hendrix's guitar playing attracted a record producer who took
him to England. He became ``Jimi.'' Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding
were added to make the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
   The band conquered Europe, and played at the Monterey Pop
Festival in 1967, which led to a record contract and a tour with
the Monkees, the made-for-television pop group. Predictably, the
music styles clashed and the tour was cut short. By August 1969,
the Experience was finished but Hendrix's music was taking off. He
formed the short-lived Band of Gypsies with Buddy Miles and Billy
Cox, whom he'd met in the Army.
   Hendrix left behind a rich musical legacy, influencing a
generation of musicians such as Prince and Eric Clapton. His
records still are among the best sellers at many stores. The heart
of his discography remains ``Are You Experienced?,'' ``Axis: Bold
as Love'' and ``Electric Ladyland.''
   Seattle has been slow to honor Hendrix, partly because his
reputation for drugs and sex didn't seem exemplary for young
citizens. Garfield High School put his bust in the second-floor
library and, when city fathers balked at a plaque in a city park,
the British director of Seattle's zoo volunteered a spot.
   Today, visitors must stand on the Jimi Hendrix memoril rocks for
the best view of the giraffes, zebras and gazelles in the zoo's
African savanna exhibit.
   A bronze sunburst marks the spot, and a sign in the shrubs
nearby reads: ``There's no telling how many lives your spirit will
go through _ die and be reborn.'' _ Jimi Hendrix.

   DALLAS -- Visitors to the Mandolin Brothers' booth at the
recent Greater Southwest Guitar Show found an eye-popping
price tag hanging from one instrument. "OK, so it's
$100,000," read a sign the Staten Island, N.Y., dealer had
placed nearby. "Go find another one."
   That would be hard to do. The rare 1958 Gibson "Flying V"
was one of only 81 shipped the year it was built. Amid a
recession that has driven down prices for Impressionist
paintings and folk art as well as many collectibles, vintage
guitars are hot -- especially those used by vintage rock 'n'
roll stars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At a London auction last year, Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
sold a 1968 Fender Stratocaster used at Woodstock by Jimi
Hendrix for $334,000 -- nearly four times the expected price.
And actor Gary Busey, who portrayed Buddy Holly in a movie,
recently paid $242,000 at a Sotheby's auction in this country
for a 1945 Gibson J-45 acoustic once owned by the late
rocker.
   In 1989, an unidentified buyer even paid $1,300 for a
fragment of a guitar smashed by rock guitarist Pete Townshend
of the Who. "The guitar market has gone berserk," says
Nashville guitar dealer George Gruhn, also a columnist for
Guitar Player magazine.
   Some industry publications have begun tracking prices
monthly, and major manufacturers such as Gibson Guitar Corp.
of Nashville and Fender Musical Instruments Corp. of Brea,
Calif., are building high-priced "reissues" of their own
classics. Gibson's 1959 Les Paul reissues, named for the
legendary guitarist who originally designed the model, sell
for as much as $4,199, compared with about $1,699 for a
similar new model.
   The original pre-1960 Gibson Les Paul models regularly
sell for more than $20,000. And rare prewar Martin D-45
acoustics are going for as much as $50,000 -- nearly
quintuple the top price of just five years ago. Still, these
prices don't come near the cost of a Stradivarius; one of the
violins sold for $1.7 million in London last November.
   The vintage guitar boom is being spurred on, in part, by
aging baby boomers seeking to recapture a piece of their
past. "We've got money to spend, and guitars, banjos and
fretted instruments are the instruments of our youth," says
Kerry Keane, a musical instrument appraiser for Skinner Inc.,
an auction house based in Bolton, Mass.
   As with most collecting fads, though, fortune hunters
should beware. Like cars, most used guitars still sell for
far less than they cost new, and dealers -- who pay top
dollar only for mint-condition guitars -- complain that many
would-be sellers expect any battered instruments they drag in
to be worth a small fortune.
   Moreover, with prices skyrocketing, guitar counterfeiters
are altering serial numbers and name plates, modifying
cheaper models, and even making pseudovintage instruments
from scratch. Some dealers now dismantle instruments before
buying to check for original paint, wiring and hardware.
"There is no such thing as a perfect forgery," says Mandolin
Brothers President Stanley Jay.
   As in so many other collecting areas, prices of vintage
guitars are being driven up by free-spending foreign
collectors and dealers. Many of them are Japanese, who prize
the American-made instruments for their tone, craftsmanship
and continuing status as the choice of most international
recording artists.
   Many U.S. guitar dealers send their inventory lists
directly to foreign collectors and dealers, despite grumbling
from some musicians and dealers about the number of vintage
instruments leaving this country. While industry figures are
hard to come by in a largely cash-and-carry business, some
dealers say foreign buyers account for as much as 75% of
their vintage sales.
   Overseas buyers have even hired U.S. "brokers" to scour
pawnshops and newspaper want ads. "They're out in the
heartland looking for these guitars," says Mark Pollack, of
Charley's Guitar Shop here.
   High-bidding Japanese buyers have become fixtures at the
growing number of guitar shows, which is why Mr. Pollack made
sure he had a Japanese-speaking employee in his booth at the
recent Dallas show, the largest of its kind. Japanese
investors have been known to buy instruments by the truckload
for shipment back to their country, where even mass-produced
workhorses like 1970s-vintage Fender Stratocasters are
selling for as much as $2,500 -- nearly three times the U.S.
price.
   "Mostly, it's the sound," says collector Mac Yasuda of
Newport Beach, Calif., an executive with Tsumura &amp; Co., a
large Tokyo-based manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and bath
additives. With the help of a toll-free U.S. telephone
number, Mr. Yasuda buys instruments for both himself and
company President Akira Tsumura, who recently opened a Tokyo
museum to display his huge collection. Mr. Yasuda's own
collection includes 50 Gibson J-200 acoustic guitars, 15
vintage Gibson Les Pauls, and seven out of the 91 D-45
acoustics made by C.F. Martin Co. of Nazareth, Pa., before
World War II.
   A variety of factors make some guitars worth more than
others. Rarities such as the prewar D-45s -- first made for
cowboy crooner Gene Autry -- and the elegant jazz guitars
handmade by the late John D'Angelico have long been prized
for their tone and craftsmanship.
   Collectors seek out certain early Les Paul models because
of the "flame" patterns in the curly maple wood used to make
them. And the Fender Stratocasters' mystique is due largely
to their use by rock stars such as Jimi Hendrix and Eric
Clapton.
   Meanwhile, a small but growing nostalgia market has
developed for some instruments that never had much snob
appeal. Dealers say baby boomers, apparently recalling the
first budget-priced instruments that their parents bought
them, are paying as much as $1,000 for Danelectro electric
guitars once sold in Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. catalogs for $59
and up.
   Dominick Montuoro, a disabled New Rochelle, N.Y.,
construction worker, began collecting them after playing one
that belonged to a friend's son. "I just fell in love with
it," says Mr. Montuoro, who now has 90 of the homely
instruments, which feature Masonite tops with pickups, a
piece of electronic hardware, made from modified lipstick
tubes.
   With prices for many vintage guitars rising and falling on
such quirky factors as which model certain rockers used on
their last tour, appraisers caution that vintage guitars are
not for investors seeking huge profits. "For the most part,
it's a slow, steady increase," says Mr. Keane, the instrument
appraiser.
   Moreover, veteran dealers like Mr. Gruhn of Nashville warn
that prices could plummet if economic troubles beset Europe
or Japan. "If anything happens to reduce foreign demand, this
market will react as though it were struck in the solar
plexis," he says.
   Some professional musicians wouldn't mind seeing that
happen. "It's outrageous," says Warner Brothers recording
artist Ry Cooder, who attended one guitar show a few years
ago, but "crawled out" when he saw the prices. To musicians,
a guitar is a tool, says Mr. Cooder, adding that "a carpenter
wouldn't pay $100 for a hammer."

<TEXT>  "Les Paul: The Legend; and the Legacy"; (Capitol; CDs and cassettes);
(star)(star)(star); The role of the electric guitar as the symbolic instrument
of pop is now undeniable. But its rise began at the cusp of the '50s with Les
Paul.;   Paul not only redefined that role -- from a chugging member of the
rhythm section in jazz big bands to a solo instrument -- he provided it with
technical and technological innovations that have now become commonplace. He
designed the now famous "Les Paul" guitar and developed the multi-track
recording process and the echo pedal.;   None of these innovations would have
made much of an impact if he hadn't been such a dazzling guitarist. But he
was. And it is all to be had on this rollicking four-CD boxed set.;   From
such initial sparklers as "Lover" and "Caravan" to such hits as "How High the
Moon" he recorded with Mary Ford, his wife and vocalist, Paul's fleeting
phrasings and his melodic meanderings, all recorded in multi-track mode with
one musical section topping another in layers of sound, are the stuff of pop
history in the making.;   The historical side is documented by Paul himself in
the enclosed booklet with comments by the master on a track-by-track basis.
The scrupulously constructed set also comes with 30 unreleased songs from
Paul's personal vaults and such rare selections as several radio programs and
even the commercials he recorded for Rheingold Beer.;   Much of the material
-- and Ford's warbly vocals -- sound like period pop pieces from the '50s. But
his trebly tones and his acrobatic solos are constantly astounding and remind
us that it was Paul who set the stage for the work of such future guitar
heroes as Jeff Beck. And the sound and the innovations he achieved -- the echo
and the rest -- are the stuff on which all of modern pop is based.; -- Harry
Sumrall; Rock; JEFF BECK; "Beckology"; (Epic/Legacy; CD and cassettes);
(star)(star)(star)(star); Of the reigning triumvirate of Clapton-Beck-Page
that virtually invented the modern concept of rock guitar in the '60s, Jeff
Beck is arguably the most intriguing. While his two counterparts have pursued
somewhat static (if brilliant) creative courses (Clapton in the blues and Page
in heavy metal), Beck has been all over the musical map.;   "Beckology" charts
that course with the same sense of rollicking abandon that has characterized
Beck's career. In the process, it encapsulates some of the wildest, noisiest,
most eccentric, idiosyncratic, wonderful, remarkable, low-down and dirty and
technically breathtaking guitar licks ever committed to record.;   It opens
with three previously unreleased cuts of Beck scratching out the blues with
the Tridents in 1963. Astoundingly, the Beck sound with its whoops and
screeches and fleeting runs was there from the start, particularly on "Nursery
Rhyme.";   From there, the set is a non-stop roller coaster ride through
Beck's revolutionary work with the Yardbirds on such hits as "Heart Full of
Soul" (in which he mimicked a sitar) to the epochal "I'm A Man" that begat
every garage and metal band that has come along since. (The set includes four
songs the group recorded live for the BBC in its heyday in 1965).;   And from
there it is on to selections of his performances with eight (!) versions of
the Jeff Beck Group, collaborations with the Jan Hammer Group and former
Vanilla Fudgers Appice and Bogert and the solo efforts from the past decade.; 
 True to the inspired oddness of its namesake, "Beckology" comes in a box that
is made to look like an old Fender guitar case. (The cover of the enclosed
booklet with its scores of photos and Beck-related anecdotes is a guitar.) It
is, hands down, the best packaging of any of the boxed sets available.;   And
it's perfectly matched by the set's music.;   From the Martian take of Les
Paul on "Jeff's Boogie" to the eloquent interpretation of Charles Mingus'
classic "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat" to the grandiose reading of "People Get Ready"
with old mate/nemesis Rod Stewart, "Beckology" proves that Beck has never
stuck with one genre or style. The only constant in his work has been the
uniqueness he has brought to every piece of music he has plucked.; -- H.S.;
JIMI HENDRIX; "Stages"; (Reprise; CDs and cassettes); (star)(star) 1/2; If
Beck and Clapton and Page invented the modern rock guitar, it was Hendrix who
embraced their various innovations and wrapped them up in one all-encompassing
onslaught. The Page metal riffs and the Clapton blues and the Beck noises
became in Hendrix's work a vast new world of sound.;   Much of that world
existed onstage, where he expanded on the sounds and songs of his studio
albums.;   While there are a number of "concert" records and CDs of Hendrix,
"Stages" is different in that it captures that world as it evolved over the
four years of Hendrix's legendary -- if brief -- career.;   Each of the set's
four CDs is drawn from individual shows (1967-1970) and comparisons of those
performances are variously redundant and illuminating. The Stockholm show from
1967 comes with notably straight renditions of the initial Hendrix hits as the
newly formed Experience feels its way through the material.;   The Paris and
San Diego shows (1968, 1969) are much looser, with the interplay between the
guitarist and bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell expanding in
various "psychedelic" directions. And the Atlanta show of 1970 (with bassist
Billy Cox) is a mostly sloppy performance that reveals the boredom that had
set in on Hendrix's part with the sound that had become his signature.;  
Songs such as "Purple Haze" and "Fire" appear on all the discs, with new
slants on each as Hendrix's sound evolved. And there are moments of inspired
spontaneity at various points.;   But none of this is new. Hendrix's volatile
shows have been documented on other records. And his real innovations, most of
which were accomplished in the studio, are obviously not included.;   This is
a set for true fans only. Anyone else who would like a full plate of Hendrix's
career should consult the excellent 1990 set "Lifelines: The Jimi Hendrix
Story," also released by Reprise.; -- H.S.; TEXAS; "Mother's Heaven";
(Mercury; CD and cassette); (star)(star)(star); Don't let the name fool you.
This Scottish dance-pop outfit is about as Texan as a cowboy in a plaid skirt.
Lead singer Sharleen Spiteri has a great big, sultry voice and a bravura,
Annie Lennox-style delivery that really lights up the often-unremarkable
material on the band's second album. The band's booming, epic-scale Euro-soul
melodies will spark comparisons with classic Eurythmics and the dance-floor
ravers Primal Scream. Instrumentally, the group borrows much from the lush,
seamless, keyboard-driven style of Bruce Hornsby. This stuff is an arresting
alternative to the din of hip-hop and house. "Mother's Heaven," "Why Believe
In You" and "Alone With You" are all rock-solid pop singles that deserve to be
played at red-line volume. It would be a pity to see a talent as big as Texas
get lost in the crowd of emerging pop groups.; -- David Plotnikoff  </TEXT>

Alive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Twenty years after his death, legendary
rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix still packs 'em in.
   They don't come in large numbers at any one time, but they come.
Some bring guitars, some bring flowers. Visitors might spend a
little time at his grave, strumming tunes.
   ``The crowds here have mellowed a bit, as has the mood of the
country,'' said Hank Kerns, general manager of Greenwood Memorial
Park, where Hendrix is buried.
   ``Once in a while they'll leave a beer can, but we're careful to
get it picked up right away.''
   Kerns said the number of visitors to Hendrix's grave has
increased during the past few years, and the Goodwill Games brought
more than usual. One national magazine, he said, listed visiting
the gravesite as one of the things to do in Seattle while attending
the international athletic contest.
   Hendrix died in London on Sept. 18, 1970. According to coroner's
records, he died when he choked on his vomit. A non-lethal amount
of barbituate drugs was found in his system.
   ``Forever in our hearts,'' reads his headstone, which includes
an electric guitar carved in bas-relief. There is little to
indicate he was the king of acid rock, but by the time of his death
at age 27 he had forged a lasting legacy.
   ``I heard he was buried around here. I needed to make the
pilgrimage,'' Peg Wood said Sunday during a visit to the cemetery.
   The 26-year-old recently moved to Seattle from Illinois to begin
an internship with the Veterans Administration as she pursues a
Ph.D. in psychology. Her ``other life'' is playing rock guitar.
   ``My parents named me Peggy Sue, for God's sake. I was destined
for a life of decadent rock 'n' roll,'' she said, laughing.
   Hendrix, who grew up in Seattle's predominantly black Central
Area, was about 14 when he talked his father into buying him a $5
used guitar, according to Al Hendrix.
   ``He wore that thing out,'' the father said. ``Later on I got
him his first electric guitar and I got a sax. I didn't know much
about the sax and he didn't know much about the guitar. So we'd
make quite a bit of noise.''
   At first, the young Hendrix was content to play along with
recordings of blues greats B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
   ``So I told him, `Come up with something original,' and he
did,'' recalled Al Hendrix. ``The first time I heard `Are You
Experienced?' (the first Jimi Hendrix Experience album), it was
something altogether different than what I was used to listening
to.''
   It didn't take long for the elder Hendrix to become one of his
son's biggest fans. Innovative, sometimes outrageous and blaring
with his music, Jimi was quiet and unassuming offstage, his father
said.
   Al Hendrix still goes to his son's grave about once a month,
still gets a kick out of recalling the times he has found fans
sitting around the grave with guitars in hand.
   Fans frequently leave small items. Peg Wood added a guitar pick
to the collection there.
   ``He was the most inventive guitar player I ever heard,'' she
said. ``I like the blues. But I felt he rewrote them. He changed
the rules so that there weren't any rules. He freed me up.''

<HEAD>Guitar Great Les Paul Still Plucks The Strings at 73</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Les Paul sat on a stool at a basement jazz club
on the Lower East Side, the fingers of his left hand cascading down
the neck of his guitar in soft, precise steps.
   At 73, the greatness of his guitar still draws laughs, sighs and
applause from audiences at Fat Tuesday's.
   For the past four years he and his three-piece group have been
playing clubs, performing the same mellow standards Paul has done
for decades. Some of them _ ``Via Con Dios,'' ``How High the Moon''
_ were songs made famous during his long partnership with his
ex-wife, the late singer Mary Ford, from whom he was divorced in
1962.
   Younger musical stars such as Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, Dire
Strait's Mark Knopfler and Dutch guitarist Eddie Van Halen come to
pay tribute and sit in with a musician who did it first and who
many believe still does it best.
   ``In my lifetime, the guitar hasn't changed enough to put in
your hat,'' Paul said, picking an imaginary guitar. ``Whether
you're Segovia or Van Halen, you can't do anything unless you can
do it here.''
   Paul, a musician-composer-designer-inventor, is the acknowledged
father of electronic music. In 1937, he became the first major
artist to play electric guitar when the 65 members of Fred Waring's
Pennsylvanians big band voted unanimously to let Paul play his
amplified contraption.
   ``Suddenly it was recognized that power was a very important
part of music,'' he said in an interview. ``To have the dynamics,
to have the way of expressing yourself beyond the normal limits of
an unamplified instrument, was incredible. Today a guy wouldn't
think of singing a song on a stage without a microphone and a sound
system.
   ``But today, there are a lot of parents who blame Les Paul for
all the racket going on in their basement,'' he said with a smile,
a reference to the thousands of teen-agers whose love affair with
the guitar is expressed in decibels.
   For seven years in the 1950s, Paul and Ford broadcast a TV show
from their home in Mahwah, N.J., which the Listerine Co. _ sponsor
of the show _ bought for the couple to get them to move to New
Jersey from California.
   It was with Ford that Paul developed two-track recording, known
today as dubbing, a process that revolutionized recording in the
'40s and is the backbone of studio work today.
   The guitar that bears his name, the Les Paul, is a legend in its
own right made by the Gibson Co. of Nashville. The list of rock and
fusion jazz musicians who choose to play it reads like a who's who
of modern popular music: blues master B.B. King, Pete Townsend of
The Who, Steve Howe of Yes, jazz great Al DiMeola, Led Zeppelin's
Page and Paul McCartney, who with Paul's help designed his own
custom version of the guitar.
   In turn, two generations of aspiring guitarists have saved their
money for Les Pauls. The most popular model today sells for between
$800 and $900.
   It is the Les Pauls' bigger, ``fatter'' sound that attracted
musicians back in the late '50s, when the first of the classically
inspired guitars was produced. The Les Pauls' innovation was the
use of two, double-coiled pick-ups that reduced the twang of other
guitars and gave the musician a broader range of sounds as the
change the tone or volume on each pick-up.
   Paul Jernigan, Gibson's marketing director, said sales figures
for the guitar are kept confidential but the 12 Les Paul models
continue to grow in popularity and the company now has six months
worth of back orders.
   The instrument's main competition for nearly two decades has
been the Fender Stratocaster, a lighter guitar with a dramatic
molded body. The Stratocaster, or Strat, as it is commonly known,
has its own claim on guitar aristocracy: Jimi Hendrix played a
Strat (and burned several on stage); Eric Clapton and Robin Trower
both prefer the Fenders.
   Ironically, Paul said, most kids these days know what a Les Paul
is, but not who he is. He also has mixed feelings about today's
rock 'n' roll and the way his guitar is now being used. He hates
distortion and electronic gimmicks. ``They're just ways of hiding
what the guitarist can't do with these,'' he said, wiggling his
fingers.
   ``The first rock stuff, I mean in the early '60s, it was bad _
bad singers, bad players, bad everything. But they went from three
chords on guitar and by 1988 we now have some fantastic musicians
in all fields. There are some kids who can go into a music store
and pick up a guitar today and play anything; it's shocking.''
   But one thing Paul has not done is stop learning.
   Gibson has agreed to market a ``super-guitar'' he is now
designing, which he said would sell for nearly $35,000. He also is
expecting a visit from McCartney at Fat Tuesday's for a
performance, though a date has not been set.
   ``You can do anything in music as long as you can think it up,''
he said. ``That's a very exciting thing.''

   Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But
he's spent the 19 years since the death of the counterculture
guitarist keeping his music alive for later generations.
   ``It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage
concerts devoted to his music,'' Voss said recently. ``We get the
14-year-olds and the 34-year-olds, but the 24-year-olds don't seem
to know who Jimi Hendrix was.
   ``There's sort of a gap there _ part of a generation apparently
doesn't realize what a force Hendrix exerted on the music performed
today.''
   Voss is trying to close the gap, spreading the word about the
acid rocker who used his teeth on the guitar strings in an
unsettling, feedback-laden rendition of the national anthem at the
Woodstock music festival.
   A former music journalist, Voss is founder of the Jimi Hendrix
Information Management Institute (JIMI), curator of a mobile museum
of the star's memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter
titled ``Voodoo Child,'' a name taken from a Hendrix hit.
   He's become a one-man clearinghouse of information about the
Seattle-born Hendrix since his drug-related death in a British
ambulance Sept. 18, 1970.
   ``As my wife says, I'm a fan turned fanatic, I spend 12 to 20
hours a week on Jimi Hendrix,'' Voss, 38, said in a telephone
interview from his Des Plaines home.
   The newsletter has about 1,500 subscribers, including one fan in
the Soviet Union who has heard only bootlegged recordings of such
Hendrix selections as ``Foxy Lady'' and ``Purple Haze.''
   A recent edition lists the latest appearances of former members
of Hendrix's various backup bands and the going prices for Hendrix
memorabilia, ranging from $4 for a mass-printed poster to $4,495
for a framed and autographed color photograph of the musician.
   ``I've also got a guitar authenticated as having been used by
Hendrix, but I don't dare exhibit that because it's worth from
$15,000 to $25,000,'' Voss said.
   ``That particular model of electric guitar from those years (a
Fender Stratocaster) would bring $2,500 in its own right now, but
the value goes up tenfold if it can be proved that Jimi touched
it.''
   Hendrix touched a lot of guitars during his last years. That's
when he would smash his instrument at the climax of a performance,
douse it with lighter fluid and leave the stage with the guitar
lying in feedback-shrieking flames.
   ``I don't know how many guitars Jimi destroyed, but I do know
that his road men would salvage the parts and try to reassemble new
guitars from the pieces,'' Voss said.
   When Voss takes his mobile museum to nightclubs, concert halls
and college campuses around the Midwest, he notices many visitors
staring at one exhibit _ a copy of Hendrix' death certificate,
which ends with the words: ``Insufficient evidence of circumstances
_ open verdict.''
   ``Too many people these days only know Hendrix as a `victim' of
drugs, they don't know about his genius as a musician,'' Voss said.
   ``The fact is that although his death was drug-related, Jimi
Hendrix did not die of an overdose. He was not even known among the
musicians of his day as a particularly heavy drug user _ although I
must admit that drug use was more widely tolerated then than it
would be now.''

   Jimi Hendrix is dead and selling jeans in Britain.
   Still selling records, too, 20 years after his death; still
unmatched by all would-be imitators of his furious, blazing mastery
of the electric guitar.
   ``The Hendrix phenomenon has never really gone away,'' says
George McManus, marketing executive at Polydor Records.
   Two decades gone, Hendrix is a briskly moving product. Polydor's
``Cornerstones'' album hit the top five and will shortly go
platinum in Britain. Wrangler adopted ``Crosstown Traffic'' for a
jeans commercial.
   Bass player Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell, the
survivors of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, each published books this
year.
   ``Jimi's death was the most lucrative act of his sad career,''
according to Redding, whose book is partly a diatribe against the
Hendrix estate.
   The U.S. Army, which counts Hendrix as an alumnus, kicked off
the year by including his ``Voodoo Chile'' as part of its amplified
get-out-of-that-refuge concert in Panama for Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The anniversary may be a melancholy event for anyone who
remembers the first ear-boggling encounter with ``Foxy Lady,''
``Manic Depression'' or ``Purple Haze'' - ``'Scuse me, while I kiss
the sky'' - from the ``Are You Experienced?'' LP in 1967.
   Serious craziness was the Hendrix experience: a stoned banshee
swathed in psychedelic foppery, caressing and bullying and
battering his guitar; bending ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' into
weird shapes at Woodstock; amazing the plaster casters; fleeing a
concert in Denver in a cloud of tear gas; taking too many downers
and choking to death on his own vomit.
   Born in Seattle in 1942, Hendrix found fame in Britain, and
Britain is where he died, in his London apartment on Sept. 18,
1970.
   His records have always sold well, but his impact wasn't widely
recognized until the Wrangler jeans company commissioned a survey
into British teen-age musical tastes. Hendrix's name ranked high
alongside living rock stars.
   Wrangler decided to feature Hendrix's ``Crosstown Traffic'' in
what became a highly effective TV commercial. Filmed in New York,
it showed a handsome young taxi driver who dumps his cab in the
middle of Manhattan and takes off to Miami. Wrangler followed up
with another commercial including footage of Hendrix in concert.
   ``His appeal is partly his rebel image and partly his short
life, the James Dean factor,'' Polydor's McManus said. ``But deeper
than that, I believe it is because he is the source of so much of
today's music. People like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard will readily
admit to the debt they owe him. You can hear 20 seconds of a guitar
and know it is Jimi Hendrix. Very few people had that ability.''
   One of the most successful new British bands to cite Hendrix as
an influence is The Stone Roses from the thriving Manchester scene,
whose ``indie dance'' music combines psychedelia with disco-derived
``house'' music.
   Hendrix's influence can be detected on their two recent Top 10
singles, ``One Love'' and ``Fools Gold''
   ``Hendrix is top for me,'' says Stone Roses guitarist John
Squire. ``He was trying to expand peoples' minds in the '60s and
we're trying to do the same thing for the '90s. He had an extrovert
approach which we share. He is one of the few people we can relate
to.''
   The two men most closely related to Hendrix have contrasting
stories to tell.
   Redding, who was sacked from the band, emphasizes financial
matters. His book, ``Are You Experienced?'' is about the millions
of dollars worth of royalties he claims to be owed.
   Mitchell's book, ``The Hendrix Experience,'' is full of pictures
and generally happier.
   Hendrix, according to Mitchell, ``was far from a tragic
character. For one thing, he had a wicked sense of humor. That's
why the women, in particular, really liked him, because we're
talking about a man who was funny.''
   One of Hendrix's secrets as a guitar technician, Mitchell
writes, were his thumbs, ``nearly as long as his fingers.''
   Mitchell also complains about his treatment by the estate, but
he had one lucrative gift from Hendrix: a Fender Stratocaster that
sold for $350,000 at auction in April.
   One important figure who has not written his memoirs is Chas
Chandler, former bass player of The Animals who saw Hendrix in a
Greenwich Village club, brought him to England and formed The Jimi
Hendrix Experience.
   ``I considered writing a book now and again, but I never had the
time, and anyway I enjoy books too much,'' Chandler said in a rare
interview.
   He has returned to his roots in a coastal village in the
northeast of England where he lives with his family and manages a
local rock outfit, The Steve Graham Band.
   Chandler produced the first two Hendrix albums, ``Are You
Experienced?'' and ``Axis: Bold as Love,'' but quit halfway through
``Electric Ladyland,'' frustrated with the hangers-on and endless
rerecording of tracks.
   ``My only obvious regret is I wonder if I didn't walk out maybe
he would still be alive. He is a loss; he was a good friend.
Otherwise, I certainly have no regrets,'' Chandler said.
   ``I do think there is a death cult around Jimi. There is
something black about all this brooding over his death. He is
typified as some sort of brooding genius. But when he was alive he
was a very funny guy, full of laughter. He was quite a gentle lad,
quiet but witty and a good mimic.
   ``You would have thought he went everywhere and burned his
guitar. But he only did it twice.''
   Chandler said that when he met him, Hendrix hadn't written a
song. ``But I knew there was a place in England for him through the
sheer potential of his guitar. The music audiences in England had
become quite sophisticated. ... The Beatles were pushing the
boundaries of what was acceptable and audiences were quite willing
to grasp something that was experimental.''
   Chandler also believes Hendrix's appeal endures because of his
imitators.
   ``Most of the riffs played by a lot of guitar bands have their
origins in Hendrix. He was an originator of sounds, the greatest
guitar player to have lived,'' Chandler said.

RICKENBACKER GUITARS ARE HIP -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 1964, the movie theater was showing "A Hard Day's Night," and five young 
Los Angeles rockers strained to read the names on the guitars the Beatles were 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
"George Harrison had a Rickenbacker," recalled Roger McGuinn, who still 
remembers every guitar in the movie. A few days later, McGuinn traded in his 
folk guitar for a gleaming new Rickenbacker electric. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he played it the next year on the Byrds' first hit record. 
</P>
<P>
Long since out of fashion, Rickenbackers are suddenly the rage again. With a 
reputation for expensive quality -- a sort of guitar version of the BMW -- 
they're big with yuppies and with foreign buyers these days. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Beatles, Rickenbacker was just another guitar maker with an unlikely 
home in conservative Orange County. The company -- once an innovator -- became 
too conservative, even stodgy, some critics say. Rickenbacker, they contend, 
wasn't adroit enough to adapt to changes in taste and technology in the 1970s 
and the invasion of foreign-made instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Rickenbacker didn't really seem to care about selling a million guitars or 
becoming a giant like Fender or Gibson, so it has maintained its reputation for 
quality. And, unlike other U.S. guitar makers, it has refused to move its 
manufacturing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
After making guitars for nearly 60 years, Rickenbacker has yet to hit sales of 
$10 million a year, or about what three busy T.G.I. Friday-type restaurants 
would do. 
</P>
<P>
Now the nondescript factory in Santa Ana is swamped with orders for the first 
time since the 1960s, and Rickenbacker is wrestling with problems it hasn't had 
since then: How to make all those guitars without getting sloppy and tarnishing 
its reputation as a small, quality manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
The people who buy Rickenbackers may be dentists and lawyers now, but they were 
adolescents in the 1960s when the Beatles, the Byrds and the Who played 
Rickenbackers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the British rock groups in the '60s used them, and nostalgia's a big 
part of their appeal now," said Richard R. Smith, a guitar collector and author 
of Rickenbacker's official history. 
</P>
<P>
The guitars' sound is so distinct that guitar players can often instantly 
identify one on a record. And even non-experts know there's something different 
about the sharp, scratchy guitar on the first few seconds of the Beatles' 
"Ticket to Ride," or the 12-string guitar that sounds like chimes on the Byrds' 
first hit, "Mr. Tambourine Man." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convinced Guitar Was a Fad 
</P>
<P>
The guitars' unusually high, clear, jangly tone also makes them popular now 
with younger bands evoking a 1960s sound. 
</P>
<P>
Adolph Rickenbacker was a Swiss immigrant who patented the first solid-body 
electric guitar in 1935, the forerunner of today's electric guitars. The 
company was named to capitalize on the fame of World War I flying ace Eddie 
Rickenbacker, said to be a distant relative. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Adolph Rickenbacker was ready to retire, he was convinced the 
electric guitar was a fad. He sold the company in 1953 to F. C. Hall, a 
distributor of radio parts who moved it from Los Angeles to be near his home in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, when an obscure young British rocker named John Lennon 
bought one, Rickenbacker was almost as well-known for its older Hawaiian 
guitars, which were played on the guitarist's lap. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Beatles came along, we went from selling thousands of guitars a year 
to tens of thousands," said John Hall, 38, son of F. C. Hall and now 
Rickenbacker's president. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beatles," said Hall, "put the company on the map." 
</P>
<P>
The guitars sold well even though they cost more than $300, by no means cheap 
then. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of the 1960s, the first Rickenbacker boom was over. The Beatles 
had broken up, and most rock had assumed a bluesier, grittier sound. Guitar 
players emerged from anonymity, and every kid wanted the same kind of guitar 
his idol played, or at least one that looked like it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried 'Dirtier Sound' 
</P>
<P>
The new stars of the guitar -- such as Eric Clapton -- usually played a Gibson 
Les Paul, which could get the rougher sound. 
</P>
<P>
With Fender's Stratocaster -- played by another innovative musician, Jimi 
Hendrix -- Gibsons were guitars to have in the 1970s. Their sales soared; 
Rickenbacker sales went off a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
The company tried to change the guitars, but it was never really able to. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to put in a dirtier sound," said Hall, who bought the company from 
his father four years ago. "It didn't really work." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1970s, things weren't going too well for the rest of the U.S. guitar 
industry, either. Sales of electric and "folk" guitars and other fretted 
instruments had jumped from 400,000 in 1960 -- before folk music and rock hit 
it big -- to 2.5 million in 1972. But the manufacturers would never again sell 
that many. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Well, the baby boomers started to age, and there were fewer teen-agers to 
buy guitars. The late 1970s were rather directionless musically; sales of 
records also suffered. By the 1980s, video games and other distractions 
competed for kids' attention. By 1987, the latest available figures, sales of 
new guitars had dipped to 1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the boom over, but first the Japanese and then the Koreans had 
ridden it right into the U.S. guitar market. 
</P>
<P>
Now guitars manufactured abroad dominate what was once an industry as unique to 
the United States as rock 'n' roll. Of the 1.2 million fretted instruments sold 
last year in the United States, just 123,000 were made in America. 
</P>
<P>
Even some of the bigger and more prestigious U.S. companies have moved much of 
their manufacturing offshore to cut costs. Fender, for instance, now makes 40% 
of its guitars abroad, and once quit manufacturing in the United States 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unknowledgeable Executives 
</P>
<P>
Some legendary names in the guitar business got hurt by imports, weak 
management and bad moves. Most had been bought by bigger companies dazzled by 
the glamour of the business. The cash that the new parent companies brought to 
the table sometimes helped soften the blow from imports. But, some critics say, 
the new owners often didn't know much about the business and hadn't the 
faintest idea how to compete with the imports. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them had a succession of executives who didn't know how to tune a 
guitar," said George Gruhn, a Nashville dealer in vintage guitars who has 
written extensively about the industry. "The Japanese often showed a better 
knowledge of the American market than the Americans did." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, for instance, all guitar manufacturers foreign and domestic shipped 
only $328 million worth of guitars at retail in the United States. By contrast, 
computer makers shipped $3.9 billion worth of home computers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Looks 
</P>
<P>
Rickenbacker is small even by the standards of this matchbox-sized industry. 
What saved the company in the 1970s was its basses. As the guitars became 
unfashionable, the basses just as suddenly became hip. They were prized for 
their own bright, clear sound. It lifted the instrument out of the rhythm 
section in some groups -- such as the art rock combo Yes, whose bassist played 
a Rickenbacker -- and made the bass another solo instrument. 
</P>
<P>
When the guitars began to come back a few years ago, it wasn't terribly 
surprising that they still looked pretty much the same as they did 25 years 
ago, since a large part of their appeal is based on nostalgia. And they still 
make the same limited -- though distinct -- range of sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Nostalgia is not cheap: A new Rickenbacker starts at around $500 and goes up to 
$2,700. That's without an amplifier or a case, both essential to the complete 
rock 'n' roller. And it's by no means the most expensive guitar these days. 
</P>
<P>
A Jackson -- a rakish semi-custom guitar often painted in garish reds or blues 
-- starts at $1,500 and goes up to $3,000. It's the guitar of choice for heavy 
metal bands these days. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the heavy metal types, a Rickenbacker is quieter and often older 
professional rockers who tend to play Rickenbackers, such as Tom Petty and 
Jackson Browne. Some newer groups are playing them too, including REM and the 
Bangles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's on MTV? It's Hot 
</P>
<P>
But the guitar market is fickle. Doc Pittillo, a Costa Mesa guitar repairman, 
said, "What's really hot is usually what the kids saw on MTV last week. That's 
why I'm in business." 
</P>
<P>
What happens when the Rickenbacker fad wanes again, as some experts say it 
surely must? 
</P>
<P>
The younger Hall seems more willing to change with the times, to some extent. A 
guitar player, unlike his father, and a friend to some of his more renowned 
customers like McGuinn, Hall has mostly tinkered with a few changes in the 
company's marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Of new models, however, there are few, and critics say the company could get 
caught flat-footed when fashion and technology change again. The last new 
guitars came out four years ago and aren't selling particularly well compared 
to the more classic models because -- in a classic Catch 22 -- the new models 
"don't look like Rickenbackers," said Hall. The company is working on some new 
guitars it will unveil this year. 
</P>
<P>
In marketing its guitars, Rickenbacker has finally deigned to use one of the 
oldest ploys in the guitar industry: Get a famous guitar player to endorse your 
product. But Rickenbacker's pitch is still largely nostalgic: Its deals are 
with older rockers such as the Byrds' McGuinn and Pete Townshend of the Who. 
Rickenbacker is selling new models of the guitars McGuinn and Townshend played 
in the 1960s and making them only in limited editions so it can charge more. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also taken to sticking "Made in America" labels on its guitars. 
That's mostly for foreign buyers. It doesn't really make much difference to the 
U.S. mass market now that guitars from abroad are as good as most U.S. guitars. 
The international market is important to Rickenbacker: Almost half the 10,000 
guitars the company says it usually makes each year are sold abroad. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a plan to manufacture better and more expensive amplifiers, which 
the company has been making for an indifferent public for 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Rickenbacker still sticks stubbornly to a nondescript section of 
Santa Ana -- almost in the shadow of several sparkling new glass office towers 
-- where it employs 100 to make guitars largely by hand. 
</P>
<P>
There are no plans to make the guitars abroad, and Hall says little will change 
at its tiny plant, where blocks of dull, beige Eastern Rock Maple enter only to 
emerge six weeks later as burnished art objects. "My name's not Rickenbacker," 
said Hall, "but I act like it is."

   A batch of rock 'n' roll memorabilia featuring
Elvis Presley's underpants and Michael Jackson's stage hat fetched
more than half a million dollars at auction Saturday.
   A lot of Presley's personal items, including a pair of
Munsingwear maroon nylon underpants, an electric razor, hairbrush
and black socks, went for $605, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman
for Sotheby's, the auctioneer.
   A Gibson model J-200 guitar Presley used in the late 1950s and
early '60s sold for $27,500, the top price paid at the auction, Ms.
Stewart said.
   Jackson's autographed fedora was sold for $4,125.
   About 30 bidders and more than 300 spectators gathered to see
226 lots of memorabilia sold for a total of $533,477, Ms. Stewart
said. The T.J. Martell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS
Research received $127,600 of the proceeds, she said.
   Top-priced items included a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar
used by Jimi Hendrix that sold for $15,400; Hendrix's silk Neru
jacket with handpainted eyes, face and other psychedelic details
that went for $13,200, and a gold ring of Presley's that attracted
a top bid of $14,300, she said.
   The Elvis Presley Museum in Nashville spent $9,900 for an
autographed bustier worn by Madonna in her music video for ``Gonna
Dress You Up In My Love,'' she said.
   Bob Dylan's handwritten lyrics for ``I Want You'' went for
$8,800, a John Lennon gray wool suit fetched $3,300 and one of
Lennon's guitar straps sold for $8,250, she said.
   A pair of high-top white and gray leather sneakers autographed
by Jam Master J and Joseph ``Run'' Simmons of Run DMC sold for
$1,870, she said.
   The sneakers, which brought four times the projected price, were
purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe of New York.
   Hard Rock America, which stocks its 10 restaurants with rock
memorabilia, paid $137,973 for 49 lots, Ms. Stewart said.
   Other items auctioned included a group of Avalon Ballroom
concert posters featuring groups such as Canned Heat, Iron
Butterfly, The Doors and Jefferson Airplane that went for $3,850,
and a set of Huey Lewis' golf clubs that sold for $2,475, Ms.
Stewart said.

FT  07 DEC 93 / Arts: Frank Zappa - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank Zappa, the guitarist and composer, has died in Los Angeles, aged 52,
from prostate cancer. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, he grew up in southern
California, attending the same high school as Captain Beefheart, aka Don Van
Vliet. His musical career began, legend has it, through a need to pay fines
for his involvement in making porn films. For the record, he began by
co-writing low-budget Western film scores with Beefheart while playing white
soul music in bars. By the mid-1960s Zappa's prodigious talent for the
electric guitar, lyrical innuendo and compositional energy was recognised
and the first of some of 70 disparate albums was recorded.
With his everchanging band, The Mothers of Invention, and records with
titles like 'Burnt Weeny Sandwich', Zappa's crazed collage of jazz
improvisation, doo-wop and fierce electric guitar rock heroics made him an
underground hero. In 1970, increasing interest in major compositional works
brought about the first of many classical collaborations, 200 Motels with
the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Later joint ventures included three volumes
with the London Symphony Orchestra baroque trio recording of the music of
Francesco Zappa (circa 1763) and, most importantly, 'The Perfect Stranger'
with Pierre Boulez and his ensemble Intercontemporain.
But it is the slickly produced and cruelly executed misanthropic rock
anthems of the 1970s and '80s for which Zappa is chiefly remembered: songs
populated by perverts ('The Detroit Enema Bandit') and Middle American
obsessions ('Jesus Thinks You're a Jerk'), with lyrics intoned by a deadpan
Zappa and terrifying solos delivered by stunt sidemen in beautifully
arranged composition.
As well as these scabrous musical observations, he will also be remembered
for a contrary code of ethics which brought him simultaneously into conflict
with the US establishment (over censorship), with hippiedom (over his
contempt for drug culture), and with Cold War eastern bloc governments (over
his funding of alternative art there).
Zappa is survived by his son Dweezil and daughter Moon Unit, who are both
rock musicians.

3 PREMIERES IN UMBRELLA SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The diversity of California was the made-to-order theme of the latest Green 
Umbrella program Monday night at Japan America Theatre. David Alan Miller 
conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group in premieres by three 
very different composers, all with at least a remote connection to the Golden 
State. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast premiere of David Lang's "Are You Experienced?" (1987) for 
narrator, amplified tuba and chamber orchestra with synthesizer and electric 
guitar proved the most ambitious undertaking. Titled after the first album of 
rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix, these six movements -- four with texts -- confuse 
and disorient both intentionally and unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
The listener anticipates references to Hendrix's music, but none occur -- save 
a short humorous episode where the amplified tuba is used to manipulate 
feedback from an amplifier. The text proceeds with a deadpan monologue about 
being on the verge of unconsciousness after a blow to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Lang read his texts mixing the monotone narrative styles of William Burroughs 
and Laurie Anderson, but humor and shock value faded quickly, as did interest. 
Meanwhile, an otherwise inventive style of composition with single-note 
repetitions and carefully structured rhythms relentlessly pulsated and at times 
loudly banged. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a wild electronic solo in the "Dance" movement, Jay 
Rozen's tuba-playing went largely unnoticed. Conductor Miller's apt attention 
to the score yielded an accurate, polished reading. 
</P>
<P>
Another West Coast premiere, Steven Stucky's modest "Sappho Fragments" (1982) 
-- a setting of five short text fragments attributed to Sappho for soprano and 
small chamber ensemble -- proceeded with conservative, carefully wrought 
instrumental materials. Here, Stucky used additive processes common to the 
Minimalist school in a way consistent with his own mainstream, atonal style. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Jennifer Trost convincingly conveyed the demanding vocal part, singing 
in both the original Greek and an English translation. Again, Miller led his 
forces admirably. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. premiere of Finlander Kaija Saariaho's "Lichtbogen"(1985-86) for 
flute, electronics and chamber ensemble, demonstrated an intelligent use of 
microtonal passages and sonorities in a Ligeti-inspired sonic portrayal of an 
arctic landscape. GREGG WAGER

<HEAD>Julian Bream Guitar Makes Record Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1964 acoustic guitar from the collection of
English classical guitarist Julian Bream has been sold for $26,100,
a world auction record for the instrument, Sotheby's said.
   The guitar, made by Robert Bouchet in Paris, was bought Thursday
by a Japanese dealer whose name was not available. The previous
record was $18,900, paid in 1974 for a south German guitar made in
1624.
   Acoustic guitars are the traditional models of the instrument
and they tend to wear out fairly quickly when used.
   Bream has said he plays his guitars for two years and then likes
to sell them for others to play.
   Electric guitars, when associated with rock stars, sell for far
more money: one owned by the late Jimi Hendrix sold in April for
$322,000.
   The record guitar and five others sold by Bream Thursday brought
in a total of $56,100.

   Life imitated art at an auction Saturday when
actor Gary Busey, who played Buddy Holly in a film biography, paid
$242,000 for an acoustic guitar owned by the late rock 'n' roll
pioneer.
   In addition to the 1945 Gibson guitar with a cover hand-tooled
by Holly himself, the 118 lots in the Holly sale included a Fender
Stratocaster guitar which netted $110,000 and a pair of the
rocker's trademark black-rimmed glasses which went for $45,100.
   The sale brought in a total of $703,615, said Laura Stewart,
spokeswoman for Sotheby's auction house.
   The proceeds will go to Holly's family, including his widow,
Maria Elena Holly, and his brother, Larry Holley of Lubbock, Texas,
Stewart said. The two were among the 200 people attending the
auction.
   Busey, who bid by telephone, was widely acclaimed for his 1978
portrayal of the bespectacled rocker in ``The Buddy Holly Story.''
His winning bid was more than six times the pre-sale estimate of
$35,000.
   The acoustic guitar, covered with four-color leather, has the
words ``Buddy Holly,'' ``Love Me'' and ``Blue Days, Black Nights''
hand-tooled across the top and ``Texas'' hand-tooled across the
bottom.
   Holly's Stratocaster electric guitar attracted nearly double its
pre-sale estimate of $60,000, and was purchased by an unidentified
bidder. Holly was playing the guitar on the ill-fated tour which
ended with his death.
   The black-rimmed glasses, which Holly wore at the end of his
career, sold for $45,100 to the Hard Rock Cafe, Stewart said. The
late John Lennon, another rocker who wore glasses, once said of
Holly's shades, ``He made it O.K. to wear glasses. I was Buddy
Holly.''
   Another prominent buyer _ Pat DiNizio, lead singer of the
Smithereens _ paid $14,300 for a reel-to-reel tape recorder and
microphone which Holly used to compose new songs.
   Holly burst into prominence in 1957, reeling off a string of
hits like ``Peggy Sue,'' ``Rave On,'' ``That'll Be The Day,''
``Maybe Baby,'' and ``Not Fade Away.'' Holly, along with J.P. ``The
Big Bopper'' Richardson and Ritchie Valens, died in a Feb. 3, 1959,
plane crash when he was 23.
   ``This memorabilia from the personal collection of Buddy Holly
provides a fascinating glimpse of the singer's boyhood and brief
years of stardom,'' Sotheby's said in its auction catalogue.
   The items date back to when Holly was 11 years old. Included
were family photographs, Holly's harmonica and camera, a business
card from his first band ``Buddy &amp; Bob,'' his personal collection
of 45s and home movies from Christmas 1958.
   There was also one particularly eerie item: a 1956 Equitable
Life insurance policy on Holly, with his parents named as
beneficiaries. This included a handwritten receipt signed by Holly.

A 1964 acoustic guitar from the collection of English classical guitarist 
Julian Bream has been sold for $26,100, a world auction record for the 
instrument, Sotheby's said. 
</P>
<P>
The guitar, made by Robert Bouchet in Paris, was bought Thursday by a Japanese 
dealer whose name was not available. The previous record was $18,900 paid in 
1974 for a south German guitar made in 1624. Bream has said he plays his 
guitars for two years and then likes to sell them for others to play. 
</P>
<P>
Electric guitars, when associated with rock stars, sell for far more money. One 
owned by the late Jimi Hendrix sold in April for $322,000.

Rock's Hall of Fame: Keep It Exclusive
---
By Jim Fusilli</HL>

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Last year, the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame welcomed its first 10 inductees, big-name performers like Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, James Brown, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, Little Richard and Ray Charles. 
Sam Phillips, founder of Sun Records, disk jockey Alan Freed, and three pre-rock musicians who influenced rockers were also honored. 
The awards ceremony and the decision to construct a Hall of Fame building in Cleveland got big play, and the baby enterprise had a rousing start. 

   Last month, the New York-based foundation that oversees the Hall and its awards ceremony tried for the same splash. 
The Jan. 21 gala bash at the Waldorf-Astoria was a triumph: Some of today's bright lights presented trophies to this year's inductees and, during a late-night jam session, Roy Orbison sang with Bruce Springsteen, Bo Diddley played with the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards, and B.B. King and John Fogerty sang "In the Midnight Hour." 

   The cuisine -- meat loaf, mashed potatoes with gravy and Oreo cookies (standard rock 'n' roll backstage fare) -- was perfect. 
What wasn't perfect was the list of inductees. 

   The Hall of Fame Foundation's crack nominating committee was determined to induct 15 rock 'n' roll performers this year. 
So the deserving -- Mr. Orbison, Mr. Diddley, Mr. King, rhythm-and-blues shouter Big Joe Turner, Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, Muddy Waters and Aretha Franklin, the first woman inductee -- wound up sharing the spotlight with the undeserving -- Bill Haley, Ricky Nelson, Eddie Cochran and the Coasters -- largely social phenomena who fall short of their fellow inductees as influential artists. 

   That's a trap the foundation must avoid if it intends to fulfill its promise and provide formal recognition for rock's seminal contributors. 
Consider: By inducting Mr. Haley, who's largely known for one hit, "Rock Around the Clock," somewhere down the road the Hall may have to let in Madonna, the living manifestation of all that's inartistic and manipulative about the genre. 
But by honoring the artists who've furthered rock as art, as the foundation has done in most instances, the Hall of Fame is something really terrific, not because it legitimizes the music but because it gives it its proper due. 

   All this wouldn't mean sand to the Sahara if the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame and foundation weren't such a good idea. 
The group is committed to providing scholarship funding and to constructing a formal research library and archive within the museum. 
The state of Ohio and the city of Cleveland have pledged to raise the $18 million to $20 million in construction costs for a building designed by I.M. Pei. 
A site will be selected later this month. 
And the Hall of Fame awards serve as a reminder that rock didn't begin with the Beatles, or even Mr. Presley. 

   Here's how the honorees are chosen: 15 musicologists, music historians, writers and performers nominate about 40 candidates. 
Some 250 music lovers from around the world are then instructed to vote for as many as 10 candidates. 
To avoid rock's current hyperbolic publicity machinery, the Hall's lone objective eligibility criterion for a performer is that it be 25 years since his or her first recording. 
The rest is subjective. 
That one objective regulation needs review. 
It offers no special exemption for post-'60s popular artists who've died; no amount of publicity can distort the contributions of Jimi Hendrix, reggae's Bob Marley and country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons. 
An innovator like Sly Stone, whose career is as dead as the aforementioned artists, deserves consideration. 

   Another gripe: The pre-rock pioneers are apparently limited to three inductees a year; this year's were country-and-western singer/songwriter Hank Williams, swing and rhythm-and-blues singer and composer Louis Jordan, and T-Bone Walker, the bluesman. 
Last year the nod went to Jimmy Yancey, Jimmy Rodgers and Robert Johnson. 
There was no reason, save mathematical symmetry, to prevent Gene Krupa, the original rock 'n' roll drummer, guitar-solo stylists like Chet Atkins and Wes Montgomery, or bluesman Willie Dixon from getting in sooner rather than later, and long before Mr. Haley and Mr. Nelson. 
A similar unnecessary limited-number rule affects membership for rock businessmen. 

   Of course, the performers provide the glitz, and that's where the Hall of Fame concentrates its promotional efforts. 
It decided to induct 15 performers this year, and its list of superluminaries ran short two-thirds of the way there. 
So Mr. Nelson, the perennial Boy Next Door, went in alongside legends B.B. King and Jackie Wilson. 
The Coasters, whose primary contribution to rock's legacy is the novelty hits "Yakety Yak" and "Charlie Brown," became the first band in the Hall. (Listen to the sax solos in each of those songs; tenorman King Curtis and not the group should have gotten the honor.) 

   Like Mr. Haley, Chubby Checker is known for one hit, but at least "The Twist" was a great, barrel-chested rumble of a vocal. 
Some of the foundation's board members -- mostly record-company executives -- were less than thrilled by the inclusion of musicians whose images were greater than their talent. 
So it's possible that the rock-performers list will be trimmed to five next year. 
Let's see: The Beatles' first record was released 25 years ago. 
So was the Beach Boys'. 
Les Paul and Leo Fender, whose names appear on virtually every electric guitar used during most of rock's first quarter century, are available. 
So is Duane Eddy, an original guitar hero, and Motown's legendary rhythm section of drummer Benny Benjamin and bassist James Jamerson. 
Producer Phil Spector ought to be in. 
Pop songwriters Carole King and Gerry Goffin, Doc Pomus and Buck Ram would make good choices. 
So might Tina Turner. 
And there's not a Bill Haley, a Ricky Nelson, in the bunch.

VERLAINE'S ACOUSTIC SET LACKS ELECTRICITY;

<P>
Like an exhibition of an artist's preliminary pencil sketches, a solo acoustic 
concert by a rocker who normally operates with a full band can give beholders a 
glimpse of pared-down essences, of the initial, unadorned vision behind the 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with Tom Verlaine's solo show Tuesday night at the Coach House was 
that the painterly analogy didn't always apply. Without a band and without 
electricity, a good deal of Verlaine's essence got lost. 
</P>
<P>
In much of his work, Verlaine is more like a master builder than a painter. 
Ever since he emerged in the 1970s as the leader of Television, Verlaine has 
been one of rock's most inventive guitar architects. His two albums with 
Television, and six subsequent solo albums (including the fine new import-only 
release, "The Wonder") all stand as excellent examples of the expressive 
capability of rock guitar. But take away Verlaine's ability to weave meaning 
through layered guitar structures and electric solo excursions, and you remove 
a large part of his work's essence. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional rock songwriters can strip their music down to voice and acoustic 
guitar and still have a miniature version of a whole -- a fairly comprehensive 
acoustic sketch of the full-color portrait they normally create with a band. 
For Verlaine, lyrics are often abstract and oblique -- offering sufficient 
clues to meanings, but not the whole story. It's left to his guitars and 
keyboard textures to shade meanings and to express the most intense emotions. 
</P>
<P>
While Verlaine made good use of dynamic shifts and well-placed pauses in his 
solo acoustic guitar accompaniments, he essentially stuck to basic chording and 
brief fills that hardly carried the expressive weight of his electric guitar 
work. The solo spotlight didn't flatter his limited voice, either. 
</P>
<P>
And with a dry, detached bearing that was as coolly mellow as a graveyard-shift 
disc jockey's, the gaunt, close-cropped singer wasn't about to win over an 
audience with chatty charm and self-revelation -- a favorite tactic of veteran 
solo acoustic performers (listeners who had come to hear opening singer Shawn 
Colvin -- apparently the majority of the small audience -- were hardly won 
over. Most of them exited early in Verlaine's 70-minute show, leaving only 50 
or so partisans to hear out his entire set). 
</P>
<P>
Unruffled by the early departures (a small audience is something this 
influential but underappreciated underground rock hero must be inured to by 
now), Verlaine sang with commitment and intensity throughout his show. 
</P>
<P>
It paid off on songs that followed more conventional narrative lines -- notably 
"Words From the Front," a straightforward monologue describing a foot soldier's 
fears on the eve of battle. Verlaine brought the character to life, his voice 
rising and cracking at the end to convey the anguish and bitterness beneath a 
stoical surface. 
</P>
<P>
The solo setting did help Verlaine underscore the humor in songs like the sexy 
"Kaleidescope" and "The Man in the Back Yard," an unrecorded number that took a 
furtive, bluesy cast. The oddity of the evening was Verlaine's concluding dip 
into country myth -- first with a direct enough rendering of Willie Nelson's 
"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain," then a convoluted medley of Johnny Cash's "Ring 
of Fire" and "I Walk the Line," which Verlaine embellished with a deadpan tale 
about Cash having an encounter with the supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of straightforward, silver-voiced solo acoustic performance got it from 
Colvin. The small, sharp-featured singer sounded far more forceful on her own 
than she does on her debut album, which suffers from a too-clean, too-cool 
production job by a team of Suzanne Vega's cohorts. 
</P>
<P>
Colvin's songs tend toward introspection that is deeply felt, but too 
conventionally expressed. Live, this strong, confident singer gave the best of 
her songs extra presence and grit, and rounded out her 70-minute set with 
well-chosen, well-executed covers that included songs by the Band, Richard 
Thompson, Talking Heads and, in a nice, light surprise, the Foundations' "Baby, 
Now That I've Found You."

<P>
The sound of his electric guitar probes through space like some futuristic 
laser weapon. 
</P>
<P>
At 39, Bill Frisell, who plays Elario's tonight at 8 and 10, has merged 
influences from Wes Montgomery, Jim Hall, Jimi Hendrix, country-Western and 
be-bop into a fresh, eclectic brew that has critics hailing the emergence of a 
guitar hero for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Frisell is revered among music reviewers. Nearly every project he touches rates 
five stars, whether it's jazz with drummer Paul Motian, whacked out make overs 
of movie music with saxophonist John Zorn's band, Naked City, or five albums of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
His newest recording, "Is That You," includes only drummer Joey Baron from 
Frisell's regular band. The music consists of nine originals plus warped 
versions of the Aretha Franklin hit "Chain of Fools" and Henry Mancini's movie 
theme, "The Days of Wine and Roses." 
</P>
<P>
Frisell's last album with his band was the 1989 "Before We Were Born." Like 
Frisell's playing, the instrumentation presents a new twist. Baron and Kermit 
Driscoll hold down traditional drums and bass positions, but cellist Hank 
Roberts adds unusual new colors. 
</P>
<P>
"He can cover such a wide range of functions," Frisell explained. "He can play 
bass (parts). Or play in the melody range where I am, or in the middle. So his 
function can be almost anything. That's actually true of everyone in the band. 
Kermit can play melodies, and Joey even plays some melodies on drums. 
</P>
<P>
"But more than the instrumentation, it's the person that I choose. Musically we 
relate on a high level, but we're also close friends. That's true with everyone 
in the band. I've been playing with Hank and Kermit since 1975. The band didn't 
really start until five years ago, but I played a lot with them over the years, 
so we already had a pretty strong connection." 
</P>
<P>
Always in search of freshness and spontaneity, Frisell includes little of his 
past material in his live shows with the group. Instead, he is using this tour, 
which opened Oct. 3 in Oakland, to develop music for an album he plans to 
record later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to play something new just about every day," Frisell said. "We're 
recording in the middle of this tour, and I want to do it very quickly and have 
it represent what the band is like live." 
</P>
<P>
Besides averaging an album a year of his own, Frisell keeps busy playing a 
variety of other sessions. In the past, these have included albums with Living 
Colour guitarist Vernon Reid, Power Tools (including drummer Ronald Shannon 
Jackson), saxophonist Jan Garbarek, bassist Eberhard Weber and drummer Billy 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, Frisell will work with Motian on an album of music by the late 
pianist Bill Evans. And a new album with Zorn is due early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned is a session pairing the risk-taking Frisell and such longtime 
associates as bassist Charlie Haden with saxophonist David Sanborn, whose music 
has generally had a broader, more commercial appeal than Frisell's. The meeting 
could bring new listeners to Frisell while expanding Sanborn's musical 
horizons. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another album will feature Frisell with clarinetist Don Byron. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Frisell originally set out to be a clarinetist himself. He played the 
horn seriously through high school in Denver, and only goofed around on guitar 
as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
In the late sixties, he heard Montgomery for the first time and began thinking 
more seriously about the guitar. He played clarinet through two years of 
studying music at the University of Northern Colorado, then hooked up with 
guitar instructor Dale Bruning, who exposed him to the jazz of Charlie Parker, 
Monk and Hall, all important influences. 
</P>
<P>
Frisell saw Hendrix in concert twice during the late '60s, but wasn't hit with 
the full impact of the music until years later: the inventive uses of echo and 
feedback, the slithering jazz-based runs, the slurred, plaintive blues cries. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more impressed with the fact that he was destroying his equipment," 
Frisell said. "The whole sound was so radical, it's taken a long time for 
people to figure out what he was doing. I wasn't that far along in my playing 
at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Some young guitarists start out playing rock and gravitate later toward jazz, 
but Frisell took a different path. From 1969 to 1974, he was dedicated to jazz, 
even though a part of him wanted to follow in Hendrix' tracks. That part came 
out of the closet for good in 1975, when Frisell heard fellow guitarist Mark 
Miller playing loud and aggressively in a small club, crossing freely between 
jazz, rock and other forms. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing that happened to me is I became open to any kind of 
music," Frisell said. "I always feel uncomfortable with labels and categories. 
I don't think they're very healthy. A few years ago, I figured out it was all 
potentially good. Rather than saying I'm rock or jazz, I don't know what to 
call it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Frisell completed a program in music at the Berklee School of Music in Boston 
during the mid-1970s, then lived in Belgium for a year, recording his first 
album with German bassist Weber. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Frisell has played on nearly 50 albums. Yet, because his music is so 
unconventional, he gets virtually no exposure on commercial radio and remains 
relatively unknown to a large number of music fans. 
</P>
<P>
On this tour, he is playing many cities across the country for the first time, 
including San Diego. While he might spy some curious expressions on the faces 
of people hearing his music for the first time, he doesn't pay much attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more focused on the playing, the guys in the band. I definitely feel the 
energy the audience is putting out. I guess I get it more from what people tell 
me later. Someone will come up to me and say that when we started out, they 
didn't know what was going on, but then they got into it. If people give the 
music enough time, keep an open mind and listen to it a whole night, they 
usually end up liking it."

   Danny Ransom spent the first six months of
his career tediously making deformed electric guitars for $10 each.
   Today, he creates near-perfect instruments, veritable works of
art, that sell for as much as $4,000 to a list of clients that
includes some of the world's best-known musicians.
   The average large-scale guitar manufacturer can produce one
guitar body and a dozen guitar necks in about seven minutes. But a
craftsman such as Ransom spends several days, sometimes weeks, on a
single instrument.
   ``These huge companies pour out these glossy ads that say, `We
build the most perfect machine in the world,' and most of their
stuff is junk,'' he says. ``I've had to make sure every instrument
is right.''
   Ransom, 36, has been in the guitar-building business 13 years. He
has built guitars for members of the Grateful Dead, Santana and
Alabama. Laurie Anderson and Jean Luc Ponty play $4,000 synthesizer
violins he made for a company called Zeta.
   Experimental guitarist Henry Kaiser bought one of Ransom's
Stratocaster-style guitars last year from a friend. He says Ransom
understands the complexities of the instrument and how the different
parts interact.
   ``He's very sensitive to all those things that go beyond most
guitar makers,'' Kaiser said. ``It's just a versatile, expressive
instrument.''
   An independent contractor, Ransom works out of a sawdust-filled
studio adjacent to ``Real Guitars,'' a collector's guitar store.
   There was a time when he was low man on the guitar-maker totem
pole. He first worked for a huge custom guitar manufacturer, now
defunct, initially building what he calls ``the worst garbage.''
   Then 23, he was hired because one of the staff builders had a
habit of taking LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) on the job and
``talking to the tools.''
   ``The day the bandsaw turned into a serpent was the day I was
brought in,'' Ransom recalls. ``They stuck me in a room with a bunch
of tools, handed me a guitar and said, `Make these.'''
   His first guitars took weeks to build and earned him a whopping
$10 each. They were stacked up and sold as seconds or thrown out.
   One particular guitar stands out in his memory. It was the first
time he'd completed a carved top for a Les Paul-style guitar. The
final touches required a butane torch, and one of his bosses decided
to show him how it was done.
   ``At first, it got these little red embers, like little coals
burning on it,'' Ransom recalls. ``I said, `Do you know what you're
doing?' He said, `Shut up, of course I do.' Then the glue line
started to lift off and the thing burst into flames right in front
of us.
   ``If you can imagine putting out a fire with coffee cups. ...
This is like watching your child burn.''
   Things started to pick up after other builders began teaching
him. Ransom says the difference between a good guitar and a bad
guitar lies in the details, such as the curves in the wood and
placement of the finger board and joints.
   ``There's a real learning that goes on with figuring out detail.
The better you can adapt your eye to detail, the better you will get
at whatever you do in terms of craft. That's really what I got from
some of the people who helped me early on.''
   His guitars, usually Stratocaster and Telecaster styles, are made
mostly from alder, ash and maple. Ransom often visits lumber yards
armed with density and moisture meters to find the right wood. Soft
woods, such as mahogony, tend to give off more mid-range sound while
harder woods, such as poplar, produce the higher, treble sounds. He
has ebony shipped from India, rosewoods from Brazil and swamp ash
from Louisiana.
   Ransom traces the guitar bodies and necks on templates, bandsaws
them out, then screws the templates back on. He runs the body off on
a pinrouter. Last, instruments are shaped and sanded, and the elbows
and bellys are cut by hand.
   As a lithography major at San Francisco State in the 1970s,
Ransom had planned to become a cabinetmaker. Prior to that, his
experience working with wood was building matchstick holders and
other ``goofy little things'' when he was a Cub Scout.
   Although he is an admitted `Deadhead' _ Grateful Dead fan _
Ransom is not much of a musician. He sees that as more of an asset
than a liability for an electric guitar and violin maker.
   ``The guitar builders who have an understanding of music but
aren't players tend to be much more versatile in their building and
are much more involved in the quality of their instrument, not just
the sound or the playability, but the overall quality.''

GUITAR MAKER TAKES TIME TO CREATE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE WORKS OF ART

<P>
Danny Ransom spent the first six months of his career tediously making deformed 
electric guitars for $10 each. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he creates near-perfect instruments, veritable works of art, that sell 
for as much as $4,000 to a list of clients that includes some of the world's 
best-known musicians. 
</P>
<P>
The average large-scale guitar manufacturer can produce one guitar body and a 
dozen guitar necks in about seven minutes. But a craftsman like Ransom spends 
several days, sometimes weeks, on a single instrument. 
</P>
<P>
"These huge companies pour out these glossy ads that say, 'We build the most 
perfect machine in the world,' and most of their stuff is junk," Ransom said. 
"I've had to make sure every instrument is right." 
</P>
<P>
Ransom, 36, has been in the guitar-making business 13 years. He has made 
guitars for members of the Grateful Dead, Santana and Alabama. Laurie Anderson 
and Jean Luc Ponty play $4,000 synthesizer violins he made for a company called 
Zeta. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Understands Complexities 
</P>
<P>
Experimental guitarist Henry Kaiser bought one of Ransom's Stratocaster-style 
guitars last year from a friend. He said Ransom understands the complexities of 
the instrument and how the different parts interact. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very sensitive to all those things that go beyond most guitar makers," 
Kaiser said. "It's just a versatile, expressive instrument." 
</P>
<P>
An independent contractor, Ransom works out of a sawdust-strewn studio adjacent 
to "Real Guitars," a collector's guitar store in the city's South of Market 
district. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Ransom was low man on the guitar-maker totem pole. He 
first worked for a huge custom guitar manufacturer, now defunct, initially 
making what he calls "the worst garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Then 23, he was hired because one of the staff workers had a habit of taking 
LSD on the job and "talking to the tools." 
</P>
<P>
"The day the bandsaw turned into a serpent was the day I was brought in," 
Ransom recalled. "They stuck me in a room with a bunch of tools, handed me a 
guitar and said, 'Make these.' " 
</P>
<P>
His first guitars took weeks to build and earned him a whopping $10 each. They 
were stacked up and sold as seconds or thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bursts Into Flames 
</P>
<P>
One particular guitar stands out in his memory. It was the first time he had 
completed a carved top for a Les Paul-style guitar. The final touches required 
a butane torch, and one of his bosses decided to show him how it was done. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, it got these little red embers, like little coals burning on it," 
Ransom said. "I said, 'Do you know what you're doing?' He said, 'Shut up, of 
course I do.' Then the glue line started to lift off and the thing burst into 
flames right in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can imagine putting out a fire with coffee cups. . . . This is like 
watching your child burn." 
</P>
<P>
Things started to pick up after other workers began teaching him. Ransom said 
the difference between a good guitar and a bad guitar lies in the details, such 
as the curves in the wood and placement of the finger board and joints. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real learning that goes on with figuring out detail. The better you 
can adapt your eye to detail, the better you will get at whatever you do in 
terms of craft. That's really what I got from some of the people who helped me 
early on." 
</P>
<P>
His guitars, usually Stratocaster and Telecaster styles, are made mostly of 
alder, ash and maple. Ransom often visits lumber yards, armed with density and 
moisture meters, to find the right wood. Soft woods, such as mahogony, tend to 
give off more mid-range sound while harder woods, such as poplar, produce the 
higher, treble sounds. 
</P>
<P>
He has ebony shipped from India, rosewoods from Brazil and swamp ash from 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Ransom traces the guitar bodies and necks on templates, cuts them out on a 
bandsaw, then screws the templates back on. He runs the body off on a pin 
router. Finally, instruments are shaped and sanded, and the elbows and bellys 
are cut by hand. 
</P>
<P>
As a lithography major at San Francisco State in the 1970s, Ransom had planned 
to become a cabinetmaker. Prior to that, his experience working with wood was 
in making matchstick holders and other "goofy little things" when he was a Cub 
Scout. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is an admitted "Deadhead" -- Grateful Dead fan -- Ransom is not 
much of a musician. He sees that as more of an asset than a liability for a 
maker of electric guitars and violins. 
</P>
<P>
"The guitar builders who have an understanding of music but aren't players tend 
to be much more versatile in their building and are much more involved in the 
quality of their instrument, not just the sound or the playability, but the 
overall quality."

ROCK LOVER LARRY CORYELL EXPLORES VAGARIES OF JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through his early work with drummer Chico Hamilton, jazz-rock group Free 
Spirits and vibist Gary Burton, Texas-born guitarist Larry Coryell emerged as 
one of the most original improvisers in jazz during the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
At the Catalina Bar and Grill on Tuesday night, Coryell, who has consistently 
been at odds with the predictable during his eclectic career, offered a 
distortion-free set of standards that verily swung from note one. 
</P>
<P>
"The intimacy of the club demands standards," the 46-year-old guitarist said 
after his opening set. "I mean, you can't play rock 'n' roll in here." 
</P>
<P>
Though smiling at the observation by his son, Julian, that he "got pretty 
raunchy" during a closing blues, Coryell nonetheless seemed pleased with having 
spent the previous hour exploring the vagaries of jazz -- that music closest to 
his rock-loving soul. 
</P>
<P>
Admiring as he might be of Jimi Hendrix's artistry and Eric Clapton's 
musicality, Coryell found sufficient expression in the tradition of John 
Coltrane's "Moment's Notice," an opening number that fairly bristled with 
boppish excitement. A unique blend of strummed chords and plucked lines showed 
Coryell to be a player of virtuosic technique with a deep sense of melodic 
invention. 
</P>
<P>
That same musicality was evident in "All the Things You Are" and the bop 
classic "Just Friends." In both cases, bassist Brian Torff and drummer Cindy 
Blackman lent substantiative rhythmic support, with Torff offering splendid 
solo outings on his Banchetti electric bass. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Stanley Cowell had ample solo opportunities and showed himself to be a 
marvelously supportive player throughout the opening set. As a composer, his 
"Equipoise" was a beautiful offering that evolved neatly from its ballad 
beginnings to a Latin-tinged cooker. 
</P>
<P>
Coryell's solo offering of the evening was an enthusiastic reading of George 
Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." In it, the guitarist, who works the Hollywood 
nightery through Sunday, displayed the multiple musical influences -- jazz, 
rock, Latin -- that have created his unique musical identity. A. JAMES LISKA

<HEAD>Who Performs `Tommy' Benefit in New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY RYCKMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meet the new Who, a little older, grayer and
quieter, but still able to deliver the goods with a punch.
   Before a packed house Tuesday night at Radio City Music Hall, the
Who played virtually its entire 1969 ``Tommy'' rock opera in a
benefit for autistic and abused children.
   It was a different Who, however, with a muted Pete Townshend
mostly playing acoustic guitar because of severe hearing problems
from years of playing loud electric guitar. He had help on lead
guitar from Steve Bolton, who added a 1980s flavor to the band's
'60s standards.
   John Entwistle's superb bass at times seemed to overpower the
other band members, but there was added support from a five-member
horn section, three backup singers, drummer Simon Phillips and
percussionist Jodi Linscott. Roger Daltrey and Towshend were both in
fine voice.
   The Who raced through an hour-long, uninterrupted ``Tommy,''
bringing the audience to its feet with ``Pinball Wizard,'' ``I'm
Free'' and ``We're Not Gonna Take It.''
   Townshend, who wrote ``Tommy,'' went through as many guitars as
he did in the old days, but this time they all went off stage in one
piece. One of Daltrey's two tamborines was the only casualty.
   The rock opera, with its muddled story line about a deaf, dumb
and blind kid who's cured and becomes a rock celebrity, was first
performed in London in 1969. It was made into a movie by Ken Russell
in 1975, starring Daltrey, Ann-Margret, Oliver Reed, Eric Clapton,
Keith Moon and Elton John as the Pinball Wizard. The Royal Canadian
Ballet did its own version and the London Symphony Orchestra did a
recording.
   ``Tommy'' has a rather mystical quality with its songs about
pinball, mobs and spiritualism.
   Townshend once joked about ``Tommy,'' saying rock critics and
many fans took it seriously but that it was really just light
entertainment.
   After performing ``Tommy,'' the band returned for an encore,
which also lasted an hour. Townshend picked up an electric guitar
for ``Can't Explain.'' And the Who had the audience on its feet
again, clapping and singing along to such Who classics as ``Behind
Blue Eyes,'' ``Love, Rein O'er Me'' and a sizzling ``Won't Get
Fooled Again.''
   The Who plans one other performance of ``Tommy,'' in Los Angeles
on Aug. 24.

FLECKTONES: MORE HIP THAN HAYSEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bluegrass it ain't. Despite the twang of strings and the whine of a harmonica, 
banjo-picking Bela Fleck and his trio, the Flecktones, come up with something 
more urban than country, more hip than hayseed. 
</P>
<P>
Their music is what the Mahavishnu Orchestra might have sounded like if it had 
been led by Earl Scruggs rather than John McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
The group's long show Monday at the Roxy, consisting mainly of Fleck originals 
pulled from his latest Warner Bros. recording, fused a number of influences and 
technologies with some solid musicianship into what aficionados call "new 
grass." Fleck puts the emphasis on the "new." 
</P>
<P>
Each band member contributed some kind of innovation, even if some were more 
technological than musical. Fleck, who also played acoustic five-string during 
the show, opened on a banjo whose familiar circular soundtable was encased in a 
Fender-style electric guitar body. Even percussionist Roy Wooten, sans traps, 
played a "Drumitar," a drum machine with large pastel buttons that has a neck 
like a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also invention of the musical sort. By bending notes with 
pin-point precision, harmonica-man Howard Levy, who often worked his mouth 
organ with one hand while playing electric keyboard with the other, pulled the 
full chromatic scale from his simple blues harp. Bassist Victor Lemonte Wooten 
(Roy's brother) has adapted the two-handed "tap" technique of guitarist Stanley 
Jordan to his instrument, fingering the neck of his bass as if it were a 
keyboard. During an unaccompanied solo he played the melody of "Chopsticks" and 
"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies" in the upper register while providing his own 
bass line. 
</P>
<P>
Fleck showed some slick chording during his own "Sunset Road," and put in some 
appropriately stormy dissonance during an uptempo "Hurricane Camille."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: DESPITE THE COMPARISONS, ULMER DOES OWN 
THING(S) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beyond jazz's mainstream and outside the confines of commercial jazz radio, 
singer and guitarist James Blood Ulmer continues his idiosyncratic 
explorations. 
</P>
<P>
Ulmer, who plays two shows at the Spirit Club in San Diego this Friday night, 
has often been linked to jazzman Ornette Coleman and rock guitarist Jimi 
Hendrix. In truth, he's one of the few true originals around. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to Ulmer, the press has overemphasized his ties to Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
"I never played with him. Yeah, he played guitar, but the only guitar player I 
listen to is Wes Montgomery." 
</P>
<P>
On the 1987 album "America -- Do You Remember the Love?," his last American 
release, Ulmer's vocals call to mind the earthy storytelling of Taj Mahal, 
while his best guitar work has a melodic, meditative quality due in part to the 
unusual tunings he uses. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Ulmer explained, all strings are tuned to the same note, so that 
open strings create a harmonic drone like the effect achieved by Indian 
sitarists. Although Ulmer's guitar work on his vocal numbers tends to be sparse 
and supportive of the singing, on instrumental tunes his improvisations often 
become collages of fiery, staccato fragments that reveal his '60s and '70s 
experiences with avant garde saxophonists Coleman and Arthur Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
After years of recording pretty much what pleased him, which made albums like 
"America" a rich mix of the danceable and the cerebral, Ulmer is changing his 
tactics in search of a broader following. Now, instead of doing earthy vocal 
songs side by side with searing, spacey instrumentals, Ulmer has two bands, one 
for each of the two directions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of being related to as a weird guitar player who does everything at 
once," Ulmer said. "More innovative, creative musical ideas create an elite 
audience. Now I'm trying to expand my audiences." 
</P>
<P>
With the group Phalanx, Ulmer continues to explore his instrumental music. He's 
appearing in San Diego with his other band, which supports the vocal music he 
refers to as his "blues thing." This band includes bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma 
and percussionist Calvin Weston, both of whom also played with Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Currently without an American recording deal, Ulmer has two albums due for 
release early next year: "James Blood Ulmer's Blues Experience," and a session 
with drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson and bassist Bill Laswell. He's hoping to 
make his next album for a U.S. label. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he wants to reach a larger audience, Ulmer doesn't care to predict 
which radio format might accommodate his music. 
</P>
<P>
"Lord, I don't know that. If I had to figure that out and write music, too, I'd 
be in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Ulmer plays shows at 9 and 11:15. Opening will be The Crows, combining members 
of Manhattan Transfer and the Mighty Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
After Ulmer kicks it off, the Week of the Guitarist continues Tuesday night, 
Dec. 12, in the San Diego City College Theater with a debut performance by Jim 
Storey with his new band Open Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Storey, 36, has played with Eddie Henderson, Richie Cole and Pharoah Sanders, 
as well as locals Hollis Gentry, Joe Marillo, Bruce Cameron and the late Ella 
Ruth Piggee, but he's trying to launch a career as a leader. The music, he 
hopes, is challenging, but also accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"This is sort of progressive fusion," Storey said. "We use acoustic bass, 
percussion and drums with electric guitar, keyboards and sax. It's not really 
funk like Lites Out jazz. It's more progressive, leaning toward Latin." 
</P>
<P>
Storey, who grew up emulating blues masters like B.B. King and Albert King 
before chasing after jazzmen like Kenny Burrell, Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, John 
Scofield, John Abercrombie and Pat Metheny, has put together a crack crew 
including saxophonist Steve Feierabend, Chris Conner on bass, Alan Eicher on 
keyboards, Danny Campbell on drums and Kim Kimmery on percussion. The band has 
a repertoire including 30 of Storey's compositions. 
</P>
<P>
Their 8 p.m. performance will be broadcast live on KSDS-FM (88.3). If you don't 
live in the heart of the city, you can receive the signal over most local cable 
television systems. A "splitter" allows you to run a separate line directly to 
the back of your receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Checkfield partners and studio wizards John Archer and Ron Satterfield are 
putting the finishing touches on the follow-up album to "Through The Lens," 
titled "A View from the Edge." The band's first three albums have sold a total 
of more than 160,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: The Daniel Hook Quartet, led by the French swing singer, will be 
featured this Sunday at 7 p.m. on KSDS's "Le Jazz Club" program. At 1 p.m. 
Saturday, Erin Searles will highlight the music of trumpeter Donald Byrd on her 
"Silhouettes in Jazz" program. . . . At Croce's in downtown San Diego: Friday 
night, Pieces, the a cappella group, and Algo Caliente; Saturday night: pianist 
Bob Hamilton followed by the Joe Marillo Quartet; Sunday night: A.J. Croce 
followed by Joe Marillo's jam session. . . . At Diego's Loft: Friday night, 
saxophonist Gary Lefebvre; Saturday night, Algo Caliente; Sunday night, fusion 
with Vehicles. . . . Tonight and Friday night at the B Street Cafe &amp; Bar in 
downtown San Diego: the Mark Lessman Band. . . . Next Wednesday, Dec. 13, 
Fattburger plays Art Good's "Jazz Trax Nite" at the Catamaran in Mission Beach.

ALBUM DEBUT IMPRESSIVE BY STEVIE SALAS COLORCODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Island Records has just released the debut album by Stevie Salas ColorCode, the 
rock 'n' roll power trio fronted by the Oceanside native. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the album, the 26-year-old guitarist and cohorts C.J. deVillar on 
bass and Winston A. Watson on drums just might steal the show from Joe 
Satriani, for whom they're opening Saturday and Sunday at the California 
Theater downtown. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just an impressive debut, but an impressive album, period. The 10 
songs, all either written or co-written by Salas, are rooted in gut-smacking 
hard rock (borderline heavy metal), but steeped in sweltering funk. This isn't 
really surprising, given that two of the first people Salas worked with after 
moving to Los Angeles in 1985 -- he spent the first half of the decade plying 
the North County bar scene with This Kid's -- were George Clinton and Bootsy 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, in fact, contributes a brief "long-distance telerap" to "Two Bullets 
and a Gun," one of the album's standout tracks. The ingredients are all there: 
a catchy melody, a ferocious beat, and Salas' delirious guitar pyrotechnics. 
Other songs on which Salas' fingers do exceptionally fine gymnastics on the 
frets are the funky, Living Colour-ish "Stand Up!" and "The Harder They Come," 
reminiscent of Aerosmith's "Walk This Way." 
</P>
<P>
That Salas is an incredible guitarist is old news. After all, he spent nearly 
two years on the road with Rod Stewart, playing the immortal licks, riffs, 
solos, and fills originally laid down by Jeff Beck and Ronnie Wood. 
</P>
<P>
The new news is that Salas is also a pretty amazing singer (all the other stuff 
he's done, both on the road and in the studio, involved only his guitar). Salas 
is certainly not your typical androgynous-sounding hard-rock shrieker; his 
voice is rangy and resonant. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed -- he's a veritable vocal chameleon, sounding, at times, like Prince 
("Just Like That"), the late Jimi Hendrix ("Indian Chief"), and even Joe Cocker 
("Over and Over Again"). 
</P>
<P>
Many San Diego acts have been signed to major labels in the last few years, but 
very few have actually succeeded in making a national name for themselves. 
Salas certainly has the talent and the credits to be in this elite minority. 
</P>
<P>
The Progressive Stage Company downtown is now featuring live music every 
Tuesday night. Rick Saxton and partner Rob Flury, working together as Uncle 
Mother Productions, are producing concerts featuring local, original-music acts 
you're not likely to see anywhere else in town. 
</P>
<P>
Past performers include progressive funk-rock band Daddy Longlegs, veteran folk 
singer Sam Hinton, acoustic folk-and-comedy duo the Rugburns, and topical 
singer-songwriter Deborah Liv Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd play the bars if they could, but the bar scene revolves around Top 40 
and discos where people don't come out to hear music, but to have a social 
scene," Saxton said. "Here, the music comes first -- no one's worried about 
booze sales or picking up on somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately enough, the Progressive Stage Company -- at 433 G St. -- holds 
just 50 people and doesn't have a liquor license. The cover charge is $5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a concert scene," Saxton said. "The atmosphere we're trying to 
create is completely different than Diego's." 
</P>
<P>
Saxton and Flury initially began producing original-music concerts together 
last summer, at the weekly Underground at the Lyceum in Horton Plaza. Last 
November, they were hired to produce the Progressive Stage Company's Homegrown 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We did all sorts of theater pieces and concerts, and when the festival ended, 
we were asked to continue doing the Tuesday night concerts," Saxton said. 
</P>
<P>
"And the response has been really good, both from the musicians and from the 
crowds. There's so much great talent in San Diego, particularly from the 
songwriter angle, that gets too little exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the Progressive Stage Company will host a double bill: Latin-folk band 
Kumara, from Tijuana, and the Transylvania String Quartet, which plays ethnic 
folk music from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: San Diego ticket brokers continue to accept "deposits" on choice 
seats for upcoming local concerts that have yet to be booked, much less 
announced -- more than likely, to improve their cash flow. Among the 
speculative shows they advertised in last Thursday's Reader are might-happen, 
might-not-happen appearances by Paul McCartney, the Grateful Dead, and New Kids 
on the Block (Ideal Ticket Agency); Billy Joel, Eric Clapton, and Madonna 
(Atlas Tickets); and Tom Petty, Billy Idol, and U2 (Trip Tickets). . . . 
Surprise guest at last Friday's Afropop Dance Party at the Bacchanal in Kearny 
Mesa: Zairean soukous superstar Tabu Ley, with seven musicians and dancers. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Richman will be making a solo concert appearance Feb. 11 at the Belly 
Up Tavern in Solana Beach. Richman is the former leader of the Modern Lovers, a 
quirky New England band from the 1970s whose charter members include Cars 
drummer Dave Robinson and Talking Heads keyboardist Jerry Harrison. . . . 
Soundgarden, the hot new grunge-rock band from Seattle that Spin magazine 
recently predicted "could become the metal band for people who hate metal," 
will be appearing Feb. 16 at Iguanas in Tijuana. The group's drummer, Matt 
Cameron, is from San Diego. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Belly Up is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the 
recovery of a black 1964 Fender Stratocaster guitar and a Fender Twin Reverb 
amplifier stolen from the club on Jan. 5. The stuff belongs to Rosie Flores' 
guitarist. . . . Actor-cum-rocker Dennis Quaid's expected one-night stand 
Monday at the Belly Up has turned into a two-nighter. He'll perform Sunday 
night as well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Molly Hatchet on Thursday at the 
Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; the Beat Farmers, also Thursday, at the Belly Up; the 
Jesus and Mary Chain and Nine Inch Nails on Friday at the California Theater; 
Nite Soil Man, also Friday, at the Casbah in Middletown; the Pandoras Saturday 
at the Spirit in Bay Park, and Leslie West on Sunday at the Bacchanal.

   Sometimes Tim Bogert's classroom gets so loud that even he wears earplugs. 

   Listening to some of his students -- in this case, the Flaming Beef Rockets -- play their guitars at a recent class, you can understand why. 
They play heavy metal rock the way it was meant to be played: very loud. 
"We're trying to re-create the ambiance of the real-life concert stage," explains Mr. Bogert, 42 years old. 

   Back in the 1970s, Mr. Bogert was a full-fledged rock star, performing as a bassist with the groups Vanilla Fudge and Cactus and recording a couple of million-seller albums in the process. 
Now, he teaches stage performance at the Musicians Institute, a trade school for rock 'n' roll and jazz musicians. 

   The institute's mission is to turn out guitarists, bassists and drummers with the level of skills in their fields that vocational schools have long instilled in plumbers and electricians. 
Students who make it through the one-year program will earn state-certified diplomas, the musical equivalent of an auto mechanic's license, in such areas as rock guitar, jazz bass or funk percussion. 

   "We like to think of ourselves as a players' school that prepares our musicians for the real world," says Pat Hicks, a guitarist and former music-store owner. 
Along with jazz guitarist Howard Roberts, he founded the institute in 1977 as a small enclave for serious jazz guitarists. 
Today, it has 886 students, double the number just three years ago. 
More than 600 are enrolled in the rock programs. 

   Traditionally, rock music is learned by listening to records and is practiced in garages and basements. 
But the institute isn't alone in trying to teach rock 'n' roll in schools. 
Students can also study rock at the Grove School, based in Ventura, Calif. 
At Five Towns College in Seaford, N.Y., secretarial students take courses alongside students in a two-year commercial music program that increasingly emphasizes rock and blues guitar. 
And the Boston-based Berklee College of Music offers the equivalent of a four-year rock 'n' roll degree as part of its "professional music" curriculum. 

   Perhaps two-thirds of Berklee's 2,600 students now enroll in rock classes, which range from Heavy Metal Band I and II to rock history. 
Just a few years back, Berklee mainly catered to jazz and classical students, says Rob Rose, the chairman of Berklee's performance studies department. 

   Though this is hardly the way Chuck Berry or Elvis Presley learned his art, some graduates have already achieved success. 
Musicians Institute students have gone on to work for the Beach Boys, the Alan Parsons Project, Chick Corea, the Righteous Brothers and Sade (pronounced shahr-DAY). 
Berklee's alumni include jazz composer Quincy Jones, guitarist Al DiMeola and drummer Steve Smith, who has played with the rock band Journey. 

   Paul Hanson, a flashy heavy metal guitarist, credits his Musicians Institute training with getting him a job coaching actor Michael J. Fox in guitar for the movie "Back to the Future." 
Then there is S.D. Grogan, a 35-year-old rock-band dropout, who says he enrolled at the institute to improve his playing and duck his bill collectors in another town. 
"This place is heavy," he says. 
"There ain't no doubt that if I live, I'm gettin' out of here a better guitar player." 

   The professionalization of rock training seems to reflect some good old-fashioned entrepreneurship. 
The Musicians Institute's Mr. Hicks notes, for example, that Americans alone own about 19 million guitars, including the million sold in 1985, creating a potentially vast market for schools like his. 
The rock-school phenomenon also reflects the growing sophistication of rock music itself. 

   "In all deference to Chuck Berry," says Berklee's Mr. Rose, "the music has moved well beyond three-chord progression." 
The driving rhythm and blues of the Rolling Stones, the jazz-inspired music of Sade, and the cat-quick, two-handed guitar work of Eddie Van Halen all fit within the rock genre now, he says. 

   Jas Obrecht, a senior editor at Guitar Player magazine, argues that classically inspired musicians like Mr. Van Halen and Yngwie Malmsteen are examples of new-generation rock guitarists who are "studying Paganini for their licks instead of other guitar players." 
Students wanting to "keep up with that kind of sophistication" are increasingly turning to rock schools, he says. 

   Mr. Van Halen, who never took a guitar lesson in his life, agrees and has delivered guest lectures at the Musicians Institute. 
Eric Clapton, a 1960s superstar, also supports the notion of formal training. 
He sponsored a guitar scholarship competition here last year. 
At Berklee, Felix Cavaliere, the founder of the Young Rascals, recently appeared at a rock-history class to tell students about surviving in the rock world. 
Among other things, he advised them to be picky in choosing whom they play with, noting that the Rascals succeeded in part because he recruited the members from the leadership of other bands. 

   If Paganini, a violinist and composer, could visit the Musicians Institute, he would find no resemblance to the cloistered 19th-century music conservatories he was familiar with. 
Instead of a quiet library where students pore over scores, the institute's students -- mostly male and averaging 22 years of age -- congregate in high-tech alcoves and run through ear-training sessions on computers or play along with videos of recorded classroom sessions. 

   One recent day, Steve Trovato delivered a crisp lecture on rhythm and blues to about 40 students as they sat, with unpowered electric guitars, trying to pluck blues solos from a written score. 

   "The blues," said Mr. Trovato, one of the institute's 50 part-time instructors, "translate lousily to sheet music." 
He then offered his own interpretation of the piece, running through a five-minute guitar solo that might have made blues master B.B. King envious. 
As a result, he got something diesel-mechanic instructors probably never hear: rousing applause from his students. 

   Just down the hall, Ron Eschete, a master jazz guitarist, interposed a complex series of chords in a simple Stevie Wonder song to demystify a theory that he hoped would improve his students' improvisational abilities. 

   At the institute, the faculty believes that students should steep themselves in all forms of contemporary music even if their sole ambition is to play punk rock. 
To be admitted, students must pass an entrance audition. 
Once enrolled, most spend about 12 hours a day in classroom, performance and practice sessions, mastering not just the mechanics of their instrument but basic music theory as well. 
No one graduates without learning to read music proficiently and passing a series of rock 'n' roll business courses. 

   "I offer seminars on everything from how to set up their own marketing network to how to get past the hotel operator and to the entertainment director to discuss bookings," says instructor Les Wise, a jazz guitarist and studio musician whose current specialty is business counseling. 

   But for Jean-Marc Porson, a 24-year-old Annapolis, Md., student, just being able to study under musicians like Mr. Bogert was enough to get him to enroll. 
In most schools, the faculty only abides the rock band, he notes, but each semester instructors like Mr. Bogert become the rock band and put on a concert. 

   "It might have been the best concert I've ever been to," Mr. Porson says.

<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Their show Tuesday night at Paul Masson Mountain Winery was testimony to
the long-lived appeal of the band's good-timey sound, but also solid proof of
its limitations.;    Their 1972 breakthrough album, "Will the Circle Be
Unbroken," was inspired and brave. During the polarized Vietnam era, five
hippies from Southern California joined ranks with relative oldsters from
Nashville to record a superb live, three-album set.;    From there they went
on to a style that blended folk and country into a light pop mix, the stuff
that 15 years ago you hummed along with on the AM stations, then probably
forgot. Next came their equally airy country rock.;    When they gathered the
new Nashville forces for the "Circle" segue, released in 1989, the album won
three Grammys and Country Music Association album of the year. But NGDB's main
role seemed to be more as facilitator than as musicians.;    So it was little
surprise that Tuesday's show included only one song off that award-winning
album (Bob Dylan's "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere"). Instead, almost the entire
70-minute, 16-song set was composed of songs from the latest of their several
"best of" albums, "Live Two Five.";    They opened with an almost-embarrassing
25th-birthday song to themselves, referring to each other by name and singing
"It's great to be part of something so good that's lasted so long." Gee,
thanks for convincing us.;    Even less convincing were the contrived and
choreographed boy-bonding antics of guitarist Jeff Hannah and Jimmy Ibbotson
-- mugging for the elaborate video camera setup, shuffling in unison across
the stage, warm smiles at each other as if to say, "Can you BELIEVE we're
still having this much fun?" My answer would have been no, not when you have
to work so hard at it.;    But founding member Hannah and bass-guitar-mandolin
player Ibbotson capably handled the lead vocals, with occasional lead vocals
by keyboardist Bob Carpenter. Jimmy Fadden played the drums and harmonica
simultaneously, which is somewhat of an impressive feat.;    After running
through such feel-good light fare as "Stand a Little Rain," "Dance Little
Jean," "Fishin' in the Dark," "Baby's Got a Hold on Me" and, of course, "Mr.
Bojangles," they honored the clamor for an encore with "Will the Circle Be
Unbroken.";    So it was a bit of irony that opening for NGBD was one of the
hottest, hard-driving bands around these days, the Texas Tornadoes.;    Led by
Freddie Fender, he of "Wasted Days, Wasted Nights" and "A Man Can Cry," the
Tornadoes include Augie Meyers and Doug Sahm of the "Sir Douglas Quintet" and
Flaco Jimenez, undisputed king of Tex-Mex accordion.;    The Tornadoes mixed
torrid border rock 'n' roll ("Adios, Mexico") with Fender's tender ballads
("Till the Last Teardrop Falls," "Tell It Like It Is") and Sahm's '60s
pop/rock hits ("Mendocino," "She's About a Mover").;    This music and these
guys, who've been playing for more than 30 years, are as real as it gets. Sahm
plays his 25-year-old Voss electric guitar with the peeling paint and cracked
varnish and his beautiful inlaid bajo sexto with equal agility.;    And Fender
does "Last Teardrop" as if he's been living that ache every day of his life
since he first sang it.;    A too-short hour set included such highlights as
keyboardist Meyers picking up the concertina for a rollicking, smoking duet
with Jiminez's accordion on Meyer's often-covered "Hey Baby, Que Paso" and a
full-on electric guitar blowout on Sahm's "Mendocino.";    All this topped off
by a Tex-Mex burner of a medley, Doug Sahm doing a subtle Mick Jagger strut to
"96 Tears" that segued into "Wooly Bully.";    Which gets us back to the irony
factor: NGDB's Hannah mentioned that, way back in the '60s, the band had
opened for Sahm's quintet.;    Sometimes, things make better sense left the
way they were.  </TEXT>

A helicopter carrying Grammy-winning blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan, three 
members of rock legend Eric Clapton's entourage and a pilot slammed into a hill 
in dense fog early today, killing all aboard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan, 35, had just finished a performance with Clapton at Alpine Valley 
Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
A National Transportation Safety Board investigator said the five-seat Bell 206 
Jet Ranger helicopter flew into the side of a 1,000-foot ski hill. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at Alpine Valley said there was dense fog after the show. 
</P>
<P>
Clapton's Los Angeles press agent, Ronnie Lippin, said the other victims were 
Bobby Brooks, Clapton's booking agent; Nigel Browne, Clapton's bodyguard, and 
Colin Smythe, one of Clapton's tour managers. The name of the pilot was not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Comer, a spokesman for Vaughan in New York, said he was told that 
Vaughan had taken a seat on the helicopter at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
"Stevie and his brother, Jimmie, and Jimmie's wife, Connie, were there" 
backstage after the concert, Comer said. "Peter Jackson, Eric Clapton's 
manager, came in and said there might be some spare seats. He came back later 
and said, 'I'm really sorry, but there's only one seat.' Stevie said, 'Do you 
mind if I take the seat? I really need to get back.' " 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan, whose style combined the best of Jimi Hendrix and the old blues 
masters, normally was not part of the Clapton tour but was added to the Alpine 
Valley show Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan had a platinum album with his band, Double Trouble, in "Couldn't Stand 
the Weather," released in 1984. In 1985, he shared a Grammy Award for best 
traditional blues recording with several other artists for a compilation album 
called "Blues Explosion." 
</P>
<P>
This year, he won a Grammy in the contemporary blues category for "In Step." 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan was born Oct. 3, 1954, in Dallas. He followed his brother, Jimmie, also 
a well-known musician in the band the Fabulous Thunderbirds, from Dallas to 
Austin in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Going from club to club and band to band, Stevie Ray Vaughan developed a 
rocking Texas roadhouse blues style. In 1981, he formed the band Double 
Trouble. The band caught the attention of record producer John Hammond, who 
helped Vaughan find a record label. 
</P>
<P>
Guitar Player Magazine cited Vaughan as the best electric blues player in 1983, 
1984, 1985, 1986 and 1988, finally naming him to its "Gallery of the Greats" in 
1989.

<LEADPARA>  IF THE electric guitar could be considered a vehicle for artistic expression,
Eric Johnson could rightfully be called the Chuck Yeager of all guitardom. The
Austin, Texas, virtuoso has devoted his career to proving just how far a
vintage Fender Strat and a Marshall amp will go -- without most of the digital
doodads of the '90s.;    "To me, it's a challenge to make the guitar an
interesting, intelligent instrument," Johnson said, in a phone call this week
from a Redding motel. (Johnson and his four-piece band are halfway through a
circuitous West Coast tour that will bring them to San Jose State University's
Event Center tonight.)  </LEADPARA>

ANOTHER GUITAR MASTER NAMED ERIC  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "It's sort of a yard tool, like something you dug out of a shed, ya know?
There's a real dichotomy of elegance and rawness there -- and to take this
thing that some people perceive to be a crude implement and craft something
delicate and beautiful with it . . . it's very rewarding," he said.;   
Johnson is a player's player. When other guitarists get to talking about pure
skill and musicianship, the name that comes up with increasing frequency is
his. Last year, the readers of Guitar Player magazine voted him "best overall
guitarist." It was the latest in a string of Guitar Player awards that began
in '86, when he was named "best new guitarist.";    Lately, Johnson is also
earning accolades far beyond the tight ranks of his fellow players. In
February, his current album, "Ah Via Musicom," was nominated for a Grammy in
the "best rock instrumental performance" category. It was the second Grammy
nomination in two albums' time.;    While the 36-year-old hotshot may still
look like an 18-year-old Tom Petty, his career dates back to the early '70s,
when he worked with a local Austin group called Mariani. "I did other things a
couple of times -- cleaned office buildings and was even a carpenter for two
days. But by the time I was 19, this was my true profession," he said.;   
"There was a period around 1980 when I got out of the whole scene for a couple
years. I was just very disillusioned with the process of getting my music
heard. It was Guitar Player's support and the 'Austin City Limits'
(television) show in '84 that really turned my career around. I'd just been
turned down by every major label in the country. And after the show aired . .
. it was like night and day.";    Johnson was signed to Reprise in '85. The
next year, his debut album, "Tones," was nominated for a Grammy in the "best
rock instrumental" category.;    After Reprise decided not to exercise an
option for a second album, Johnson eventually signed with Cinema Records, a
small label expressly designed to market new acts to consumers who had tuned
out of rock when the "progressive" rock genre of the mid-'70s waned. Cinema
chief Denny Somach was looking for new faces to appeal to the 25- to
49-year-old crowd who grew up on groups such as Pink Floyd, Genesis and Yes.
Cinema eventually became an in-house production company for giant Capitol
Records.;    After more than a year of work, Johnson's Capitol debut, "Ah Via
Musicom," hit the stores in March 1990. Amazingly, the self-produced, mostly
instrumental disc got heavy airplay on mainstream album-oriented rock outlets.
Although Capitol promotions staffers offered instrumental tracks from
"Musicom" to "new age" radio, they say few stations have added the songs so
far.;    Over the course of just two albums, Johnson has earned a reputation
as something of an obsessive character in the studio. When it comes to his
quest for the perfect, pure tone, no amount of time is too much, and no detail
is too small.;    Johnson said he decided to produce "Musicom" himself rather
than go with a more experienced producer, because he had a very specific
vision of what he wanted: "There's an entire range of producers -- from people
who insist on total control to those who just accommodate whatever an artist
wants. I wanted to do a record where I could push myself to that arena of
perfection. It's like an artist painting a picture -- some want to make each
stroke themselves; others want another hand to steady the brush. There's
nothing wrong with either way.";    Johnson said his next album, which he's
writing now, will include a sharp turn toward a more spontaneous, live sound.
For a player-producer known for demanding near-surgical precision in the
studio, it represents a tremendous leap of faith. "I'd like to experiment with
capturing the spontaneous energy of shows. It's possible we'll even cut half
of the album live in the studio (recording parts simultaneously rather than
sequentially). I have a lot of respect for classical players who can go in and
just do spontaneously -- and do it right -- because their technique is so
perfect.";    Eric Johnson; Where: San Jose State University Event Center,

<HEAD>Guild Guitar Corp. Sold To Wisconsin Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTERLY, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The guitar company that made instruments
for stars from Elvis Presley to Johnny Cash has been sold to a
Wisconsin company after two months of bankruptcy proceedings.
   Randall Corp., which makes electronic amplifiers, hopes to expand
its product line with the purchase of Guild Guitar Corp., said
Patricia Meyer, marketing services manager.
   The Wisconsin company paid $2.1 million for Guild at a
court-ordered auction on Tuesday, Meyer said. A U.S. bankruptcy
judge approved the transaction.
   Guild filed for Chapter 11 protection in November after losing
about $30,000 a month for several years, said court-appointed
trustee Michael Weingarten.
   The company will continue to operate its Westerly factory, which
makes about 25 guitars a day, a union official said. At its peak in
the 1970s, Guild was making about 100 guitars a day, said Dorothy
Gentile, president of the local Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union.
   Guild's acoustic and electric guitars have been plucked, strummed
and banged by, among others, Elvis, Johnny Cash, Eric Clapton and
members of the bands Def Leppard and Twisted Sister.

EXPERIENCING JIMI HENDRIX; 
</P>
<P>
FOR TODAY'S BUDDING CROP OF BLACK ROCK MUSICIANS, HE'S MORE THAN A GUITAR HERO 
-- HE'S A ROLE MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some sounds speak directly to the subconscious -- the blast of a cherry bomb, 
the howl of a siren . . . the scream of Jimi Hendrix's feedback at the start of 
"Foxy Lady." 
</P>
<P>
If Jimi Hendrix were alive, he would be 47 on Monday. To mark the occasion, the 
Black Rock Coalition -- a nonprofit organization formed to fight racism and 
combat negative stereotypes in the music industry -- will present the first 
"Jimi Hendrix Birthday Celebration" at the Music Machine in West Los Angeles at 
8 p.m. on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a field almost exclusively populated by white musicians, Hendrix has served 
as a role model for a cadre of young black rockers. His achievement was to 
reclaim title to a musical form pioneered by black innovators like Little 
Richard and Chuck Berry in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
For years, critics and musicians in pop circles have hailed Hendrix -- who died 
on Sept. 18, 1970, as a result of inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate 
intoxication -- as one of the most creative and influential rock guitarists 
ever. But his impact on today's budding crop of black rock musicians runs even 
deeper. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of Hendrix in the same context as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm 
X," said Vernon Reid, guitarist for Living Colour and a founder of the Black 
Rock Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he was one of the seminal black figures. Unfortunately, people get so 
wrapped up in his guitar playing that they tend to overlook what he did with 
sound and composition. Like Coltrane, Miles (Davis) and Ornette (Coleman), 
Jimi's presence fundamentally changed the equation." 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Kravitz, whose '60s-influenced solo debut album, "Let Love Rule," has 
received kudos from critics and in college and alternative radio circles, cites 
Hendrix as a crucial link in the development of black music. 
</P>
<P>
"For Jimi radio airplay wasn't the premise," Kravitz said. "He didn't just 
write hit songs or hooks. Back then rock music was about free expression and 
Jimi was an innovative artist at the top of his form. People tend to forget 
that rock 'n' roll is black music -- not just white people either. Black people 
forget too. Hendrix opened the doors for guys like me. He is the perfect 
example of a black artist doing what he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Nelson, who plays bass for the BRC (Black Rock Coalition) All Stars, the 
band that will open the Music Machine bill (local rockers Total Eclipse and 
East Coast rappers Culture Shock are also scheduled), says it would be 
impossible to overestimate 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix's importance in the local black rock community. 
</P>
<P>
"Hendrix did for rock what Charlie Parker did for jazz," Nelson said. "He was 
like a modern-day Bach or Beethoven, a musical mastermind who came in and 
completely changed the entire scene." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the Hendrix tribute will be used by the BRC to underwrite the 
coalition's ongoing campaign to secure a star for Hendrix on the Hollywood 
Boulevard Walk of Fame. Local BRC co-director Ray Jarvis says the coalition 
chose to single out Hendrix's contribution because his music represents the 
"essence of what the BRC is all about." 
</P>
<P>
The BRC was established in 1985 by Vernon Reid, writer Gregg Tate and film 
producer Konda Mason. Local directors MaryAlice Bailey, Norwood Fisher, Mason 
and Jarvis opened the Los Angeles chapter in May. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, this idea of treating black rock like it's a separate sub-genre of 
rock," Reid said. "When a white band like AC/DC plays rock, they're actually 
playing black music. Rock 'n' roll was created by black musicians." 
</P>
<P>
Reid believes that Hendrix's race is central to his relevance. 
</P>
<P>
"Who could listen to 'Machine Gun' without thinking about black soldiers in 
Vietnam?" Reid asked. "It's because he was black that his version of 'The Star 
Spangled Banner' is so powerful. It's too bad that Jimi was taken from us 
before he could really explore the jazz direction." 
</P>
<P>
BRC member Dr. Frank Gilliam, a professor in UCLA's political science 
department, says one reason Hendrix is so revered is because his music helped 
many middle-class black rock fans overcome a social identity crisis they 
experienced during the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us in the BRC were raised in the suburbs, the first wave of black 
working-class children," Gilliam said. "When we were growing up, rock was not 
cool music for black kids to enjoy. Either you listened to 'soul' music or else 
you were considered 'whitewashed.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Gilliam, Hendrix's music and his anti-war, pro-civil rights 
political stance offered black teen-agers who loved rock 'n' roll a new ethnic 
role model -- a black man internationally respected for modernizing black roots 
music who was unafraid to experiment with Anglo-cultural influences. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimi personified the 'transculturation' of America for middle-class blacks," 
Gilliam said. "He validated our position in society, the fact that we were 
proud to be black, but also not enslaved by the black 
</P>
<P>
experience." 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix's penchant for loud, dissonant feedback altered the course of funk 
music too. Many R&amp;B musicians who cut their teeth on James Brown and Sly 
&amp; the Family Stone were stunned by the power of his eclecticism. 
</P>
<P>
George Clinton, whose work has influenced black stars from Prince to De La 
Soul, says Hendrix's psychedelic approach to the pentatonic scale not only 
taught him to respect blues music, but also encouraged him to experiment in new 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimi was definitely the one we held up when we wanted to reach for something," 
Clinton said. "The way he could control feedback and make it sound so symphonic 
truly transcended logic. There were no boundaries to his playing. One minute he 
would sound like Curtis Mayfield, next thing he'd be doing Ravi Shankar. His 
music gave me the freedom to go out and be anything I felt like being 
musically." 
</P>
<P>
Coalition members also consider Hendrix to be the first rock musician to 
seriously explore atonal improvisation with amplified feedback and electronic 
distortion. During the late 1960s, his efforts in this regard drew praise from 
respected figures in the jazz community like Miles Davis and Gil Evans. In 
Davis' 1989 autobiography, the trumpeter credits Hendrix with influencing his 
shift toward a more rock-edged sound. 
</P>
<P>
James Marshall Hendrix was born in Seattle on Nov. 27, 1942. Before bursting on 
the pop scene as a headliner in 1967, he worked the chitlin circuit as a 
sideman. Between 1963 and 1965, he toured with and/or performed session work 
for many R&amp;B stars, including King Curtis, Ike &amp; Tina Turner, the Isley 
Brothers, Jackie Wilson, James Brown, Solomon Burke and Little Richard. 
</P>
<P>
Little Richard remembers Hendrix as a consummate showman who strongly resented 
the racism he encountered in the music industry: "Jimi helped open up rock 'n' 
roll to black music. He broke down the doors and burned up all the wood. He was 
one big package." 
</P>
<P>
Hendrix moved to England when he was 23 and began pioneering new musical genres 
like metal and fusion before they even had names. Within a year of linking up 
with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding to form the Jimi Hendrix 
Experience, Hendrix was cutting gold albums and selling out international 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
After that integrated power trio folded in 1969, Hendrix created the Band of 
Gypsies with black musicians Buddy Miles (drums) and Billy Cox (bass) and began 
to publicly support the political struggles of blacks, American Indians and 
Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
During his life, Hendrix's playing not only dazzled his fans and and peers, but 
it also impressed many of the artists whose styles he emulated. During the 
course of his career, he jammed with pioneers like Roland Kirk, B.B. King and 
Muddy Waters. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Mayfield, whose influence on Hendrix is evident in compositions like 
"Little Wing" and "Electric Ladyland," says that even though he had the 
opportunity to play with Hendrix, he still stands in awe of the late 
guitarist's abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimi's approach to music transcends racial barriers. His imagination spoke to 
people on a deeper level than that," Mayfield said. "With the psychedelics and 
what have you, he was almost like a scientist, studying the effects." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hendrix released only five albums during his brief career, his legacy 
lives on. In the 19 years since his death, six official compilations and more 
than 400 bootleg records have appeared on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Merlis, head of publicity at Warner Bros. Records, says Hendrix is still 
the label's most consistent seller. His original five albums have all reached 
the 3 million sales mark. Nine albums have been digitally remastered and 
reissued as CDs on Warner Bros./Reprise. "Smash Hits," a best-of collection 
first released in 1969 and containing such classic Hendrix numbers as "Foxy 
Lady" and "Purple Haze," was re-released early this month in CD, and comes 
complete with a new high-tech graphics track that allows fans who own JVC's new 
CD-plus-graphics unit to view synchronized psychedelic imagery while listening. 
</P>
<P>
For serious fans, a musical transcription series called the Jimi Hendrix 
Reference Library is also available in album-and-book packages from Hal Leonard 
Publishing. The latest addition to the catalogue is called "Variations on a 
Theme: 'Red House' -- Evolution of the Blues," featuring narration and singing 
by blues legend and Hendrix fanatic John Lee Hooker. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other prominent music figures of the 1960s' anti-Establishment drug 
culture, Hendrix seems to have little difficulty competing in today's 
techno-synth market. Producer Alan Douglas, who runs Are You Experienced, the 
Hollywood company that merchandises all official Hendrix estate music and 
memorabilia, estimates that 75% of Hendrix's current audience is between 12 and 
20 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimi is no nostalgia figure," Douglas said. "He is still a relevant force in 
rock. Kids today relate to his music as if he was still alive."

<TEXT>
<P>
On a balmy Tuesday night earlier this month, 250 people filed cheerfully into 
Ojai's Matilija Junior High School auditorium. They were a folk music crowd -- 
thirtyish and open-collared -- and they sat on hard wooden seats, facing a 
stage adorned with fiddle, guitar, Autoharp, piano and hammered dulcimer. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd had come for John McCutcheon, the Virginia-based performer whose 
tools these were, but also for the tools themselves: Traditional musical 
instruments, challenged in the marketplace by high-technology these past few 
years, have come through as popular as ever in Ventura County and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have ended up like you," McCutcheon told the audience as he fingered 
his banjo. "I got good grades in school and all that. But I started playing the 
banjo, and everything started going to hell from then on." He was smiling, of 
course, and many in the crowd were smiling back. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I first heard Pete Seeger," McCutcheon, 37, said in an 
interview a few days before. "It was inviting, like saying, 'You can do this.' 
He never said that, but the message was there. 'You've got this wooden box with 
strings across it. And you can make music on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
That sense of invitation still exists. Since 1987, musical instrument merchants 
nationwide have reported a resurgence in sales for unamplified instruments from 
guitars to drums. In 1988, the last year for which figures are available, an 
American Music Conference survey showed that acoustic guitar sales were up 26%. 
Bowed string instrument sales -- including violins, cellos and basses -- were 
up 12%. Percussion and wind instrument sales also rose, but less dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Those reports followed several flat years in the mid-1980s, when many consumers 
were drawn to a new crop of electronic keyboard instruments and electric 
guitars. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the recording industry has found ready audiences for such 
acoustically oriented artists as singer-guitarist Tracy Chapman and 
singer-pianist Bruce Hornsby. Windham Hill Records, the Palo Alto "New Age" 
record label that was founded 14 years ago, reports annual sales of $25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a revival in folk music, really," said Becky Lowe, who with her 
husband, Tom, has been presenting folk concerts around Ojai for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Lowes, who said they pass any profits along to the performers, organized 
McCutcheon's concert. In March, they brought a New England folk trio named 
Matamora to the Ojai Woman's Club and drew about 100 paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
On May 5, the Lowes will again occupy the Woman's Club, this time to present 
Figgy Duff, a Newfoundland sextet that at various times employs accordion, 
harmonica, bouzouki (a mandolin-like instrument that originated in Greece), 
fiddle, guitar, hammered dulcimer, bodhran, flute, whistles, concertina, harp, 
keyboards and electric bass. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, the City Bakery presents occasional acoustic performances. On April 
27, folk singers Fred Starner and Larry Penn will play there. The cover charge 
is $3. On June 2, an appearance by the local group Acoustic Medicine is 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians can't always take this new interest to the bank; several local 
observers say they haven't noticed any particular increase audiences for 
acoustic concerts. But an unscientific local survey suggests that the acoustic 
revival has not left Ventura County behind. 
</P>
<P>
Electric guitars continue to outsell acoustics 2-to-1 at McCabe's Music in 
Santa Paula, by the estimate of clerk Marco Avelino, and a salesman estimated 
that acoustic guitar sales were up only slightly at Henson's Music Center in 
Oxnard. But at Henson's Music Center in Camarillo and Heck Music Center in 
Ventura, the story is different. 
</P>
<P>
"We are selling quite a few more acoustic guitars than we did, say, two years 
ago," said Andy Feldman, assistant manager at Henson's in Santa Paula. "I would 
say I sell three acoustics to every electric. Two years ago, it was probably 
two electrics to one acoustic." 
</P>
<P>
"Tracy Chapman came up," said saleswoman Daphne Jones at Heck Music Center, 
"and all of a sudden everybody was coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Nadine Bunn, co-owner of Folk Mote Music in Santa Barbara -- which sells no 
electric instruments -- reports that her store's sales in the second half of 
1989 were up 15% over the second half of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Chapman, a co-founder of the Old Time Fiddlers' Assn. in Ojai, estimates 
that the group's membership -- 380 players and enthusiasts -- has grown by 75 
or more in the last two years. From 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. on the second and fourth 
Sundays of every month, the association takes over the Oak View Community 
Center on Valley Road for jam sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of interest," said Seabury Gould, an Ojai guitarist and 
keyboard player who has been performing and teaching in Ventura County for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the signs of a good musician is that you can unplug him and he still 
sounds good," Gould said. "If a musician is completely relying on electronics, 
something is wrong. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
McCutcheon started his set in the auditorium with a song about trains, 
suggesting somehow a train whistle with his banjo-picking. 
</P>
<P>
"And I hate to hear that lonesome whistle blow," he sang. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

VERLAINE UNPLUGS HIS GUITAR FOR SOLO TOUR; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK: THE SEMINAL SONGWRITER-GUITARIST WITH A LONG HISTORY OF AMPLIFIED 
EXCURSIONS GOES ACOUSTIC IN SOUTHLAND TOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an ideal universe, all rock albums would be titled "Adventure," or at least 
would try to live up to that label. To Tom Verlaine, whose seminal '70s band 
Television did indeed claim "Adventure" as the title to its second LP, that's 
the whole point of the music. 
</P>
<P>
"It always surprises me when I hear so many bands sounding like so many other 
bands," Verlaine said in a recent phone interview from his Manhattan apartment. 
"I always felt like there was an obligation to either do something fresh or to 
do something that somehow was like making something for yourself, really to 
surprise yourself." 
</P>
<P>
With Television then and in a solo career dotted with infrequent pulses of 
brilliance, the singer/songwriter/guitarist has created a body of songs that so 
sharply delineate interior emotional landscapes that they can seem like dreams 
held in place with a spike. 
</P>
<P>
Using a standard rock instrumentation, Verlaine's recordings construct 
multitiered architectures of sound, inhabited by a fearless fretboard style 
that shoves his electric guitar beyond the boundaries of musical reason. 
</P>
<P>
In light of his history of amplified excursions, Verlaine's current move 
certainly qualifies as adventurous. He has embarked on a solo acoustic tour, 
which began Tuesday at San Juan Capistrano's Coach House and continues tonight 
at Bogart's in Long Beach and Thursday and Friday at McCabe's -- with 
intentions of issuing an equally acoustic album later this year. But while at 
odds with practically everything he has put on record, the acoustic side is 
nothing new to Verlaine. 
</P>
<P>
"All the songs in the last bunch of years are written on acoustic guitar, and I 
started playing acoustic shows in '85 in Europe," he said, "It just had a 
certain appeal to me. Maybe it's an intimacy factor. It really puts you into 
your voice. And it actually puts you into your body in a way that electric 
music doesn't. It's a mystery to me, but it's something I like to hear and do." 
</P>
<P>
He initially wanted to do an acoustic album in 1984, but the idea was turned 
down by his record label, Phonogram in Britain. That proved to be the least of 
his troubles with the label, which, Verlaine claims, refused to issue one 
completed album and grievously remixed and delayed his last two releases, 
"Flash Light" and "The Wonder." The latter, recorded in 1988, wasn't issued in 
Europe until earlier this year, and remains unreleased in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
If Verlaine's songs seem to be born of a dreamlike reverie, that isn't far from 
the actual source for many of them. "Pillow" on "The Wonder" is a haunting 
lullaby made up of fragmentary scenes from a relationship, some observed by a 
dove outside the couple's window. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the ideas I get seem to be when I'm falling asleep at night," 
Verlaine said. "I often hit this place where sometimes I can remember and 
sometimes I can't, but something goes on there. And sometimes it's literally 
like there's a bird there that you're having a conversation with. Often there's 
music there as well. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can wake myself out of it, or generally I kind of double up out of it -- 
it's a weird state -- I'll go to the tape deck and hum a melody, then fall 
asleep, and the next day I'll hear it and it'll bring some of that back." 
</P>
<P>
When not working on music or traveling -- he likes extended visits out of New 
York, such as the two months he spent in L.A. last year -- Verlaine pursues a 
fascination with the byways taken by the human mind. He says he once spent five 
months studying various psychoanalytic theories. 
</P>
<P>
"Or I hit moods where I want to learn about how somebody thought things that 
could be so foreign to me. It could be a poet, a theorist, a linguist, or a 
composer that grabs you. I was reading some letters by Liszt, and this guy's 
outlook is just so totally different from anything you would imagine for 
yourself, very courteous but ferocious, a strong character. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think these interests color what I write. But I think that it helps 
keep your brain strong by studying outlooks that are so foreign to your own. I 
try to work out 'How and why did this person ever develop this?' " 
</P>
<P>
And if someone were to pore over Verlaine's own works with such an intent? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'd say, 'Well, this guy's method was chaos.' "

<LEADPARA>  NEIL YOUNG'S Bridge School Benefit is more like a chance to hang out in
Young's living room and listen to some of his friends perform than your
typical arena show.;   Now in its fifth year, it's one of those
only-in-the-Bay-Area things that people in the rest of the country can hardly
believe.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ACOUSTIC NIGHT WITH NEIL YOUNG HAS POWER TO BURN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story; Concert Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Saturday night's lineup, including Willie Nelson, John Lee Hooker, Don
Henley, Tracy Chapman, Sonic Youth and Nils Lofgren in a five-hour show at
Shoreline Amphitheater, was stunning, despite a number of ragged points in the
sound system and one of the biggest failures in the show's history.;   Still,
for $15 a pop, this was a chance to see legendary performers stretch out and
try something new, while helping a worthy cause. It was thoroughly
entertaining, even at its low point.;   The show's premise is that performers
play acoustic instruments, although it is not strictly followed. Hooker, who
came out third, brought his electric guitar for three songs, including "King
Snake Boogie.";   "He's been playing his electric guitar all his life," said
Young, introducing him. "He's earned the right to do what he wants.";   Young
and Nicolette Larsen, who played with Young 13 years ago on his album "Comes a
Time," opened with Bob Dylan's "Forever Young," with Young on organ. Last
year, when he was leaning toward punk acoustic guitar, Young had opened with a
raving version of another Dylan song, "Everything's Broken.";   Folk
performers Larry Kegan and Gene LaFond played a pair of inspiring songs
challenging the notion of being disabled. One of them had the chorus "This
wheelchair keeps on rolling.";   Henley gave a performance not unlike his
Shoreline show this summer, singing while backed by a full band. He played
standards "The End of the Innocence," "Heart of the Matter" and "Best of My
Love." He added an excellent version of Joni Mitchell's "Wish I Had a River"
and a '40s love song, "Come Rain or Come Shine.";   Lofgren and Chapman did
half-hour sets that concentrated on new songs. Lofgren jammed with Young on
one and brought down the house on another with an acoustic guitar solo.
Chapman ended her set with a mournful version of "Amazing Grace," which she
dedicated to promoter Bill Graham. The audience spontaneously stood and sang
along, for a beautiful and sad memorial.;   Sound problems;   Then came Sonic
Youth in a memorable bust. On "Dirty Boots" and "Mote," they sounded great. It
was refreshing to hear them pump up acoustic guitars to get the energy they
usually get from feedback and distortion. But because the stage monitors
failed, they couldn't hear themselves.;   In the middle of "Cinderella's Big
Score" they stopped and gave up, yelling at the sound crew.;   "We just flew
in from New York," they explained as they were booed off. Kim Gordon smashed
an acoustic guitar in frustration.;   You could see why Young would like them
though -- they burned out; they didn't fade away.;   Nelson, even more a hero
for taking on the Internal Revenue Service, did a set of standards with a
couple of new songs. Backed by a chromatic harmonica player, he strummed his
guitar for "On the Road Again," "Mama Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be
Cowboys," "Crazy," and "Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain.";   His simple manner
and straightforward singing brought down the house.;   Backed by Larsen and
his old Stray Gators band, Young finished up with a set of his sweetest music:
"Long May You Run," "Birds," "Comes a Time," "Harvest Moon" and "Can We Get it
Together?";   A couple of weeks after releasing his most intense electric
album, Young was taking a direction as far from that as possible, back to his
most mellow songs.;   He called the others back for a sing-along reprise of
"Forever Young" and in Graham's memory, ended with a guitar version of
"Greensleeves," which used to close all of his shows.  </TEXT>

Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But he's spent the 19 years since 
the death of the counterculture guitarist keeping his music alive for later 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage concerts devoted 
to his music," Voss said recently. "We get the 14-year-olds and the 
34-year-olds, but the 24-year-olds don't seem to know who Jimi Hendrix was. 
</P>
<P>
"There's sort of a gap there -- part of a generation apparently doesn't realize 
what a force Hendrix exerted on the music performed today." 
</P>
<P>
Voss is trying to close the gap, spreading the word about the acid rocker who 
used his teeth on the guitar strings in an unsettling, feedback-laden rendition 
of the national anthem at the Woodstock music festival. 
</P>
<P>
A former music journalist, Voss, 38, is founder of the Jimi Hendrix Information 
Management Institute (JIMI), curator of a mobile museum of the star's 
memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter titled "Voodoo Child," a name 
taken from a Hendrix hit. 
</P>
<P>
He's become a one-man clearinghouse of information about the Seattle-born 
Hendrix since the musician's drug-related death in Britain Sept. 18, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"As my wife says, I'm a fan turned fanatic, I spend 12 to 20 hours a week on 
Jimi Hendrix," said Voss.

JAZZ:THE SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY JAZZ ENSEMBLE WAS PLAYING ITS HEART OUT. 
AND THIS TIME SOMEONE OF NOTE TOOK NOTICE.

Musicians dream of being discovered, of a moment when a music industry power 
broker walks up after a show and says, "I love your stuff. How would you like 
to make an album?" 
</P>
<P>
For the San Diego State University Jazz Ensemble, that moment came last January 
at the National Assn. of Jazz Educators convention at the Town &amp; Country 
Hotel in Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble had been selected to play the main stage in front of 3,000 jazz 
educators and industry insiders on opening night, a prestigious gig during a 
conference that included such top jazz pros as the Count Basie Orchestra, 
trombonist Bill Watrous and saxophonists Red Rodney and Michael Brecker. 
</P>
<P>
"The band played the best it's ever played," recalled band director Bill 
Yeager. 
</P>
<P>
One influential listener agreed. 
</P>
<P>
In the audience that night was Albert Marx, president of Los Angeles-based 
Discovery Records and a 60-year veteran of recording jazz. Art Tatum, Sarah 
Vaughan, Dizzy Gillespie and Duke Ellington are among the jazz giants Marx has 
worked with over the years. 
</P>
<P>
When he heard the SDSU ensemble at the convention, his reaction was immediate 
and uncomplicated. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were great," Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up afterward and said, 'I want to record this band,' " Yeager said. 
</P>
<P>
The result is the 17-piece ensemble's first-ever album, "Don't Make Noise," due 
in record stores by early November. 
</P>
<P>
Although many collegiate jazz ensembles have produced albums on their own, it 
is rare for such a band to record for a major jazz label like Discovery, which 
issues about 40 albums a year. 
</P>
<P>
The group could have gone with safe, traditional material for the album, but 
Yeager chose a mix ranging from traditional big-band charts to tunes that show 
the rock 'n' roll side of many young jazz players. 
</P>
<P>
"There are eight absolutely different styles," Yeager said. "It's the sort of 
album that is extremely challenging for the musicians. They were asked to wear 
a lot of different hats. I don't think a person could say they didn't like it. 
If they didn't like one cut, they'll find something else: fusion, 
straight-ahead swing, jazz shuffle, rock shuffle, Latin, funk." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to big-band charts selected by Yeager, the album includes original 
tunes by Bill Macpherson, the band's guitarist, and by Rick Helzer, the 
associate director of jazz studies at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson's title cut shows an eclectic mix of styles. Searing electric guitar 
lines played over a thumping rhythm section of electric bass and drums launch 
the song forcefully. Though Macpherson's guitar work shows influences ranging 
from Jimi Hendrix to contemporary electric jazz guitarists such as John 
McLaughlin, Al Dimeola and Lee Ritenour, his writing is testimony to his solid 
grasp of big-band history. 
</P>
<P>
Good dynamics and sophisticated interplay between the wind sections -- saxes 
and flutes, trombones and trumpets -- prove Macpherson has done his share of 
listening to Duke Ellington and other great big-band composers. 
</P>
<P>
"Just when you're thinking it's a fusion number, there's a sudden switch to 
straight-ahead up-tempo swing," Yeager said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, we come right back on the next cut with Don Menza's 'Tattoo,' " a 
medium-swing Basie-style number with upright bass." 
</P>
<P>
Most college jazz ensembles are made up of rosy-cheeked musicians barely out of 
their teens. But Yeager's crew boasts the kind of seasoning usually found in 
professional groups. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the members are in their late 20s or early 30s. Macpherson has been 
with the band three years. He earned a bachelor's in music from the revered 
Berklee School of Music in Boston before traveling west to work on a master's 
at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"All the guys in the rhythm section are in their 30s," Yeager said. "Our bass 
player, Oliver Shirley, has been here as long as I have -- five years. This 
year we have four new members, and that's more than usual." 
</P>
<P>
And just because many of the players are older than your average college 
student doesn't mean they are career students. Most earn a living playing a 
variety of 
</P>
<P>
gigs outside the college jazz band. Macpherson's group, World Beat, appears in 
local clubs, and trumpeter Jeff Beck and sax man Les Jennings are members of 
the local rock band Dr. Feelgood and the Interns of Love. 
</P>
<P>
Other ensemble members perform with such local bands as Book of Colors, 
Borracho y Loco and Limbo Slam. 
</P>
<P>
Under Yeager, the jazz ensemble has become one of the top college bands in the 
country. In 1988, the group was selected as the top college jazz ensemble in 
the National Collegiate Jazz Competition at Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla. Last 
spring, the ensemble placed first in its division in the annual jazz festival 
at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Players in the ensemble devote serious time to the music. The group practices 
together twice a week for 90 minutes. Yeager also requires that each of the 
band's four sections -- trumpets, trombones, woodwinds and rhythm (guitar, 
bass, drums) -- practice together on their own. Of course, players spend a good 
portion of additional time learning their individual parts. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why the group has rallied around Yeager, a seasoned player and 
educator. 
</P>
<P>
He directed the instrumental program at the well-known Grove School of Music in 
Los Angeles, then founded the Los Angeles Jazz Workshop in 1979 before coming 
to San Diego State as director of jazz studies. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent practice session, he spurred his musicians on more like an 
enthusiastic peer than a seasoned academic. 
</P>
<P>
"Short notes . . . bite 'em," he emphasized to the horn players. "I want to 
hear silence on that eighth rest. That's what makes us sound tight. 
</P>
<P>
During another break, he and the trombonists debated a particular phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
"Overruled," Yeager exclaimed merrily, exercising the veto power that comes 
with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
The serious work was broken up by good-natured joking between Yeager and the 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the humor, they are serious about their music. 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson hopes to get his own group recorded some day soon, and this album 
could be a stepping stone. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first jazz album I've played on," he said. "I've been in the 
studio before, but I consider it a milestone in my career that I've finally had 
something released, and I look forward to more opportunities opening up." 
</P>
<P>
 The jazz ensemble will perform Tuesday night Oct. 31 at 7 with San Diego 
saxophonist Charles McPherson in Smith Recital Hall on the university campus.

<LEADPARA>  WHEN guitar virtuoso Al DiMeola decided to make an album of Latin-American
music, he went straight to one of its sources -- the father of modern tango,
composer Astor Piazzolla.;   "The overall spirit of this record is an homage
to his genius and soul," says DiMeola, adding his current album "World
Sinfonia" (Mesa/Bluemoon) includes the Piazzolla number "Tango Suite."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     World Sinfonia also is the name of DiMeola's new acoustic quartet. The
group plays tonight through Sunday at Yoshi's in Oakland.;   DiMeola, 37, says
he spent the last four years being turned down by record companies. Because of
his reputation, which includes stints with Chick Corea's influential electric
'70s fusion band, Return to Forever, and 13 solo albums, the guitarist managed
to stay afloat by touring steadily throughout the world.;   "I fueled a lot of
the frustration into positive energy," says DiMeola by phone from his New
Jersey home. "But I'm dedicating the new album to the deaths of all the record
label presidents that turned me down.";   "World Sinfonia" is among the top 10
entries in Billboard's contemporary jazz albums chart. An electric album,
titled "Kiss My Axe," is due in late November.;   "I missed playing the
electric guitar," says DiMeola. "But it was not easy getting the major labels
to listen to my new stuff. Most people there are tuned to signing rap and
heavy-metal acts and they've lost touch with what's good music.";   Unlike
many contemporary jazz musicians, DiMeola believes there is still great
interest in the sort of frenetic fusion popularized by Return to Forever.;  
"That group broke up prematurely," says DiMeola. "It was a major mistake. We
could have sold out arenas. The record companies could not have been more
wrong. Fusion is more alive now than ever. In the industry, you're dealing
with idiots. They put money into rap, heavy metal and easy-listening jazz. I
can't believe there's that much bad taste.";   The state of popular music
bothers DiMeola to no end. Rap, he says, "has nothing to do with talent. I
mean, you've got musicians out there who have studied their instruments for
decades, and can't get arrested, let alone signed.";   As for heavy metal,
"how can anybody in their right mind compare the first two albums of Led
Zeppelin to Guns N' Roses? Zeppelin had something. There were some good tunes
and they played well. It was loud and metallic, but there was taste all over
the place.";   Although certain stations are playing DiMeola's new music, the
guitarist says he has "given up on radio because every time I tune in I get so
disappointed. There's a world of good music out there and it frustrates me
that nobody in radio recognizes that. People want something different.";  
DiMeola has strong words for guitarist Carlos Santana, who jumped on the
fusion bandwagon in the '70s, but remains a steady concert draw with his
Latin-rock band, Santana.;   "You can do what Santana does, which is play the
same notes over and over for the last 20 years," says DiMeola. "But I just
don't feel it's necessary to ruin the music with excessive displays."; Al
DiMeola with Dino Saluzzi; When: 9 and 11 p.m. tonight-Saturday, 8 and 10 p.m.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: SELF-TAUGHT GUITARIST SCOTT HUCKABAY TO STRUM HIS ACOUSTIC 
STUFF AT BEBOP

<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Huckabay was no child phenom. He didn't even pick up a guitar until he 
finished playing with adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hanging around in the basement, when I found this old, thick Spanish 
guitar," said Huckabay, who was 17 at the time. "It suddenly became part of me, 
and I couldn't put it down. I found my thing." 
</P>
<P>
Today, his thing has landed him recognition -- he placed second recently in BAM 
magazine's vote for guitarist of the year. On Thursday, Huckabay, 25, will 
strum his stuff at BeBop Records in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Huckabay, who lives in San Clemente, has never taken a lesson. Since his 
basement discovery, he taught himself everything, graduating from the Spanish 
instrument to an electric guitar to his current acoustic version. After a 
motorcycle accident in Arizona, he used his recuperation period to jam with his 
acoustic guitar. He sees it as his best chance for a career breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much competition in the electric, heavy-metal scene," Huckabay 
said. "But it's still an open market for acoustic players." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Huckabay has only performed instrumental songs; he released a tape on 
his own label, Fresh Ltd. He's written lyrics, but has hesitated to sing them 
at concerts. "I just don't feel I've progressed to that level yet. It will come 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
At BeBop, he will stick to the acoustic guitar. He will also put together a 
light show. "I was never really into rock 'n' roll as a kid," he said. "I'm 
much more into jazz and classical." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Huckabay will play his acoustic guitar at 8 p.m. Thursday, at BeBop 
Records, 18433 Sherman Way, Reseda. Donations are requested. For information, 
call (818) 881-1654. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Summer in Santa Monica once again means the outdoor concert series, "Grand 
Summer Nights," which will open July 1 with a country-Western theme. Glen 
Campbell is the featured guest. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-concert series, sponsored by Santa Monica College, will present jazz, 
mariachi and acoustic music. Among the performers will be the Oak Ridge Boys on 
July 15 and Lionel Hampton on Aug. 19. For the first time in the three-year 
event, admission, ranging from $7.50 to $15, will be charged, except the July 1 
event is free. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people complained that they couldn't get in last year," said Gloria 
Mottler, the program coordinator for campus events. "When it was free, people 
would arrive very early and take all the seats." 
</P>
<P>
The July 1 show at Corsair Field will also include displays, booths, free 
children's rides and a fireworks show. Most of the concerts will take place at 
the 1,800-seat college amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Grand Summer Nights" concert series begins at 8 p.m. July 1. For 
information, call (213) 452-9209. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the eighth anniversary of the Southern California Blues Society, a 
concert will be held Saturday at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga. 
The show will feature Junior Wells, who has toured internationally for four 
decades, and Cash McCall, who has played with such artists as Muddy Waters, 
Ramsey Lewis and Etta James. 
</P>
<P>
They will be joined by Blues groups from Los Angeles. Among them will be "The 
Mighty Flyers," a modern, faster-paced music than the traditional Chicago 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to provide a full range of different blues," said Eddie Archer, the 
concert's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Celebration of the Blues," sponsored by the Southern California Blues 
Society, will take place at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N. Topanga 
Canyon Blvd., Topanga, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m Saturday. Tickets are $20, $17 in 
advance. For information, call (714) 594-5051.

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: SURF ROCK'S HISTORY WRAPPED UP BY A LONGTIME DEVOTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert J. Dalley was hooked in an instant when he heard the surf rock 
instrumental "Pipeline" barreling over the radio one day in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley, 15 at the time, bought an electric guitar with his paper route money 
and set out to become part of the instrumental surf music scene that crested 
during the early '60s, then ebbed with the arrival of the Beatles. But it was 
with a typewriter, rather than with a Fender Stratocaster, that Dalley 
ultimately wound up writing his chapter in surf rock history. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he wrote 41 chapters. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley's book, "Surfin' Guitars: Instrumental Surf Bands of the Sixties," 
devotes a chapter to each of 41 bands from the peak days of surf rock, 
including 12 hailing from Orange County. In each case, Dalley hunted up former 
members, got them to reminisce into a tape recorder, and compiled the 
histories, memorabilia and discographies that fill his 421-page, independently 
published soft-cover volume. 
</P>
<P>
"Surfin' Guitars" is a specialty project that will be of value and interest 
mainly to committed surf rock fans and early-'60s pop history buffs: Of the 41 
groups chronicled, only five ever placed a song in the Billboard Top 100. 
Dalley's plain but usually serviceable prose won't rescue any of the lesser 
lights from obscurity. But by giving a basic recounting of each group's story, 
along with reproductions of their photos, posters and press clippings, he has 
managed to safeguard them from oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
For Dalley, now 40, the book originated 10 years ago with his own attempt to 
regain a bit of youthful spark. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going crazy, not being in a band, not doing anything," said the 
friendly, broad-built Azusa resident who makes his living reproducing documents 
for microfilm. "The first thing I thought of was, 'Let's play some surf 
music."' 
</P>
<P>
Dalley, who grew up inland in Covina and never learned to surf, formed a surf 
rock revival band, the Surf Raiders, that stayed together through most of the 
1980s. In trying to recapture the authentic early '60s sound, he began to hunt 
for original surf music recordings. He also sought out two former members of 
the Surfaris, the band that created "Wipe Out," one of the most enduring and 
influential rock instrumentals. 
</P>
<P>
Dalley's aim was only to ask their advice on how to replicate the '60s surf 
sound. But the tape-recorded talks ended up forming the basis for an article 
that he submitted to Goldmine, the record collectors' magazine. Dalley soon 
began to write a regular surf music column for Goldmine, and he continued to 
seek out interviews with original surf bands. After deciding to compile a book, 
he cast his net as widely as possible, with the aim of making a comprehensive 
surf rock history. Dalley even enlisted the help of a private detective to 
track down a charter member of one hard-to-trace band. 
</P>
<P>
While Dalley rarely strays from his straight biographical narratives into 
analysis or social commentary, "Surfin' Guitars" depicts a musical period that 
had the qualities of innocence and a naive creativity -- qualities all but 
snuffed out in today's bureaucratized, conglomerated music industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Chantays, from Santa Ana, were teen-age musical novices when they started 
in 1961, inspired by Dick Dale, the Orange County surf-rock pioneer who emerges 
repeatedly in the book as a key influence on other bands. Within a year of 
taking up their instruments, the Chantays had written and recorded "Pipeline," 
the No. 4 national hit that hooked Dalley on surf music. 
</P>
<P>
Except for rap music, a grass-roots, cheap-to-produce form that pop's corporate 
masters haven't yet found a way to control, such sudden rises are virtually 
inconceivable today. 
</P>
<P>
Recording and promoting music has become a slow, costly, calculated business 
guided by long-term marketing strategies. One-hit, out-of-the-blue wonders like 
the Chantays -- or the Pyramids, whose "Penetration" was also a Top 20 surf hit 
-- simply don't get signed nowadays by major labels, which look at bands either 
as tax write-offs or as expensive, long-term investments. It is true that 
smaller, independent labels sign such bands all the time, but no prominent pop 
radio station seems to have the gumption to run with an unknown act's song and 
give it the airing it may deserve. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, surprise hits like "Pipeline" and "Wipe Out" were the norm. What the 
music business gives us today is a world in which surprise is barely possible. 
Aside from rap -- which requires the guidance of a technologically savvy 
producer -- there is no place in the pop mainstream today for the kinds of 
musically unschooled, naive enthusiasts who gave us surf music and its direct 
heirs, mid-'60s garage-rock and psychedelic rock. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiast's spirit lives with Robert Dalley. Before he could go to press 
with his book, he said, he had to come up with about $13,000 to pay for 
printing. He raised some of it by selling his guitar and amplifiers and -- 
after committing his favorite songs to tape -- by auctioning his collection of 
rare surf records. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done everything I can to promote surf music," Dalley said. "My book is 
the culmination of it. I don't see what more I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Dalley figures he eventually will at least break even by selling his first 
printing of 2,000 copies through an international network of surf music fans. 
The book, published in November, is on sale at Music Market in Costa Mesa and 
Soest Guitar Repair in Orange, Dalley said. Copies, priced at $28, also are 
available by mail from Robert J. Dalley at Dept. OC, 6209 Oakbank Drive, Azusa, 
Calif. 91702. 
</P>
<P>
As for hearing the old surf rock style played live, Dalley said, several 
revival bands and a handful of reformed original surf rock combos still 
perform, including the Surfaris and the Chantays. Dick Dale and the Deltones 
remain an Orange County rock institution; they can be heard Friday night at 
Night Moves in Huntington Beach. Information: (714) 840-6118. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra's Mind Over 4 looks like a shoo-in for hardest working band in Orange 
County (if not the known universe). The quartet, which blends pounding 
thrash-metal with art-rock atmospherics, went into For the Record studios in 
Orange on last Wednesday at 5 p.m., according to singer Spike Xavier, and 
emerged Saturday at 3 p.m. after nonstop recording and mixing of a new, 12-song 
album. 
</P>
<P>
After a few hours' rest and relaxation, they played a Saturday night show at 
Night Moves. 
</P>
<P>
Why such a hectic schedule? Mind Over 4 recently signed a European recording 
deal with Destiny Records, a West German company, and wants to have the album 
out by late May when the band will begin a 2 1/2-month tour of Europe (with the 
Vandals, satiric punk rockers with Orange County origins of their own). 
</P>
<P>
Mind Over 4 was due to leave Wednesday night on a cross-country tour that will 
end with a showcase gig at CBGB's, the famed New York City alternative rock 
bar. Then it is on to West Germany for the start of the European tour, which 
also will take the band through Holland, Yugoslavia, France, Spain, Italy, 
England and Ireland. The Vandals will go on to Iceland; Mind Over 4 will fly 
back to New York in late August, play its way back across the country and 
arrive in Orange County just in time to start recording yet another album, this 
time for Powerhouse Records, a new Orange County-based label. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to take at least 5 days recording that one," Xavier said. In 
all, he said, Mind Over 4 expects to play 110 shows over the next 120 days -- a 
schedule with the potential to turn the most leathery-lunged singer's vocal 
chords into thin spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
No problem, Xavier said. "I got the magic potion: hot tea and peach brandy 
right before I go on stage. It totally works."

ROCKIN' RICHMAN RIDES THE TIDE OF LIFE -- WITH A PASSION; 
</P>
<P>
POP: THE LEADER OF THE MODERN LOVERS HAS TURNED HIS REMARKABLE ENTHUSIASM TO 
SURF MUSIC, BUT THAT WON'T BE THE ONLY KIND OF MUSIC HE PLAYS TONIGHT AT THE 
COACH HOUSE IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, WHERE HE SHARES THE BILL WITH DICK DALE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Guitarist Brennan Totten, who toured for a few years with Jonathan Richman's 
Modern Lovers, can recall an occasion when he was pulled over by a state 
trooper while driving the band through Texas. 
</P>
<P>
What began as a routine traffic citation wound up with the officer giving them 
the third degree, having been discomfited by the sight of Richman, star of the 
international stage and recording world, perched barefoot and birdlike on the 
rear seat, all-but heedless of the police presence as he shoveled down a quart 
of Haagen-Dazs with an unnerving abandon. 
</P>
<P>
Richman really likes to eat. Driving to Orange County from his Northern 
California home, he will pick up a Harris Ranch pie and eat it by the handful, 
along with yogurt, Cornnuts, malteds and the standard road food cornucopia. At 
2 a.m. in a coffee shop, he'll have the chili, the banana pancakes and the 
onion rings. 
</P>
<P>
His current "Jonathan Richman" album contains a bit of oratory that addresses 
this subject, "I Eat With Gusto, Damn! You Bet." And therein lies one of the 
constants of Richman's work: He sings about the things he has a passion for. 
</P>
<P>
That he -- given his caloric intake -- doesn't possess the approximate bulk of 
a water bed says something about the nature of Richman's passions: He tends to 
do most things with gusto, so energetically tackling every moment that one 
suspects he even slumbers with a taxing enthusiasm. If a phone conversation 
with him sounds just a bit disjointed, it's probably because he's 
simultaneously flipping on his backyard trampoline. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, when he was a self-described "brooding Angst-ridden adolescent," 
Richman recorded "The Modern Lovers," an album sufficiently dark and uptight to 
influence the Sex Pistols and a host of other glum chums, and to be regarded 
more recently by Rolling Stone magazine as No. 52 in its list of the "100 Best 
Albums of the Last 20 Years." 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, though, Richman's songs instead have evoked a world that's 
loose and limber, where, when "your friends are dancing on the lawn, no one 
acts like something's wrong"; where love and romance win out over fear; and 
where one can be snared passionately by the life reaching out from Van Gogh 
paintings, a sleeping wife, old corner stores, a hot summer night, or even 
discarded chewing gum wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 38-year-old's present enthusiasms is surf music; a desire to play 
some twang-oriented bills led to his shows with "King of the Surf Guitar" Dick 
Dale tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano and Saturday at Bogart's 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Orange County two weeks ago, Richman claimed: "The fixation with surf 
guitar isn't recent. It's something people were comparing my guitar style to 
even when I was starting out. It's part of my guitar playing. 
</P>
<P>
"The new fixation is wanting to be part of the Southern California music scene 
because I'm lonely up there in Northern Cal right now. The closest music scene 
I can think of to what I'm doing is surf music, at least of the music that's 
still being played now in California." 
</P>
<P>
Richman won't be particularly more surf-bent at these shows than he's ever been 
-- indeed, he's recently taken to accompanying himself with only a 
nylon-stringed classical guitar. But he sees several connections between the 
two types of music. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, there's a strong love of nature in both styles -- it's 
physical. And second, there's also a kind of dreaminess in surf music that is 
also in mine. The way they describe a scene with guitars, I tend to describe it 
more with words, but with both you're supposed to feel it rather than 
understand it. 
</P>
<P>
"Another reason why I like playing with surf acts is both styles are party 
music, as far as I'm concerned. I don't want it to be a concert. I want it to 
be like a party, which to me is where you feel loose enough to dance, without 
anybody making a big deal out of it, and where you have a lot of fun. I think 
once rock 'n' roll got taken seriously, it ruined everything." 
</P>
<P>
Although Richman rhapsodizes about the surf scene and wanting to take part in 
the sort of 12-act rock-and-roll cavalcades that rumbled through the states in 
the '50s, he insists he's not living in the past but rather hoping for a future 
when our pop culture may get back that early warmth and innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be part of something new," he said. "I've been lonely for stuff 
before, but now is the time when I sense something different could happen. And 
I also think that these '80s were lonely enough where I just want to reach out 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"That's also why I'm doing my country record (due out on Rounder later this 
year). I want to be a part of there being more communication between different 
kinds of musicians." (Victor Borge is Richman's favorite stage performer. He 
also has a warm regard for the early Iggy Pop.) 
</P>
<P>
And what makes him think the '90s can be different from the '80s? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even have a clue. I just want it to be. I'm ready for the '90s. I 
didn't like the '80s. It was just so distant. Great things happened to me 
personally in the '80s, but overall it was just a decade where more people 
drove by, and less where they got out of the car and shook hands." 
</P>
<P>
Although some of his harsher critics seem to presume that Richman gets his 
hopeful view of the world from the Care Bears, he is distressingly well-read on 
the sorry ecological, political and cultural state of things. But he chooses to 
think some good eventually may come from our overstressed times. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," he said, "I think L.A. may be one of the first cities to get a 
really terrific public transportation system because the pollution is getting 
so bad, I think it's going to push it in that good direction. And overall, I 
think when things get isolated so much, like they did in the '80s, people will 
get tired of it and want to get closer." 
</P>
<P>
While the song "Closer" on the "Jonathan Richman" album is about his wife, 
Gail, closer also describes Richman's professional direction. The ideal 
performance to him is one where the audience shows "lots of emotion: I want to 
see lots of gnashing of teeth and beating on chests, weeping and wailing. I 
want to see crying and dancing in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
To that end he employs the nylon-string guitar and performs solo because the 
nakedness of thesound makes for a more intimate show -- "I was pretty 
spontaneous anyway with a band; now I'm unstoppable." He thinks volume has its 
place in teen-age music but likens his over-amped contemporaries to "seeing 
your dad at the intersection revving the engine of his sports car. It's 
embarrassing." In a bio sent to fans last year, he described high-volume as 
"not a necessity but a hindrance to communication and intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
He's not one to go for technological blockades on his records either. Most of 
the "Jonathan Richman" album was first-take material, with only his stamping 
feet accompanying his guitar and vocals on several tracks. (Two instrumentals, 
"Blue Moon" and "Sleepwalk," feature longtime bass associate Curly Keranen and 
the late Ron Wilson, creator of what is undoubtedly the world's most copied 
drum solo, the original "Wipeout.") 
</P>
<P>
The record not only contains mistakes, but also has a song extolling them, "A 
Mistake Today for Me." There is the French-language "Que Reste-T-ll de Nos 
Amours?" from French balladeer Charles Trenet, while "Fender Stratocaster" 
paints a rocking, shimmering impressionistic vision of that O.C.-born electric 
guitar: 
</P>
<P>
 Like the wind in your hair when the top is down, 
</P>
<P>
 Like taillights headed for another town, 
</P>
<P>
 Fender Stratocaster, there's something about that sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I started playing music when I was 17, I wanted to be a painter," 
Richman recalls. "Then I realized I could make stuff happen right in front of 
people, not just do it at home and have them see it later. Once I saw that, I 
said, 'Whooa! That's what I want to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's still the case. "I promised myself then that I'd quit if it ever became 
work instead of fun. It would really take some searching to find something I'd 
enjoy nearly as much as this." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Richman and the Dick Dale Power Trio play tonight at 9 at the Coach 
House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $15. Information:

MURAL OF JIMI HENDRIX TO STAY

<P>
A mural of the late guitarist Jimi Hendrix at a high school will not be 
whitewashed despite a petition by some students who object to the rock star's 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"I hesitate to accept that Jimi Hendrix's life and work can or should be 
condensed into, 'He is a symbol of drug abuse,' " Ridgefield High School 
Principal Elaine Bessette said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Fulkerson, the student who started the petition drive, said he is 
disappointed with the decision but added that more students wanted the mural 
than did not. He had said that it is hypocritical to display a symbol of the 
drug culture in school and collected nearly 100 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The rock guitarist died in 1970 at the age of 27 when he reportedly suffocated 
after swallowing a large quantity of barbiturates. The petition drive prompted 
the estate of Jimi Hendrix to issue an open letter defending the rock star as 
an artist.

<LEADPARA>  HENRY Threadgill's compositions carry a biological imperative: Grow or die.
They are alive not only in the sense that they seem to evolve as they unfold,
revealing themselves in sly and amazing ways, but also because they
recapitulate the history of jazz while moving it forward.;    Growing up in
Chicago, Threadgill, 47, played saxophone in marching bands, Latino clubs,
blues bands and even an Italian-Polish polka ensemble. Asked recently what
advice he would give to aspiring musicians, he said: Refuse to be limited to
one style or type of music; learn from all of it.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Jazz Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Ever-developing;  His own trajectory is proof of the wisdom of that advice.
In the '70s, he combined ragtime and the structural grace of Jelly Roll Morton
and Scott Joplin with an abstract, free-jazz conception in the trio Air (sax,
bass and drums). In the '80s he led a septet that included cello, trumpet,
trombone and two percussionists.;    Thursday he arrived at Koncepts Cultural
Gallery in Oakland -- the 19th scheduled stop on a national bus tour -- with
two tubas, two electric guitars, a French horn, drums and his own alto sax and
flutes.;    The substitution of Mark Taylor's French horn for the trombone
heard on "Spirit of Nuff . . . Nuff" (Black Saint) makes the group sound
smoother and darker. (The Koncepts sessions are being recorded by Taylor Made
Records.);    The tubas (Marcus Rojas and Edwin Rodriguez) are, of course, an
updating of the New Orleans marching band. And the electric guitars (Brandon
Ross and Masujaa) take a page from the jazz/rock of Miles Davis and Ornette
Coleman. But in the same group?;    It worked beautifully.;    As the big
brass pounded beneath, propelling the group with an irresistible force, Ross
-- in shoulder-length dreads -- bent blue notes in the upper register, and
Masujaa's shadings shimmered.;    Emphasis on texture;  Themes took shape
gradually, the melody sometimes emerging only after a long development. The
leader's gritty-grainy, vocalized alto was used sparingly. For the most part,
he was content to let his compositions shine. The emphasis was on texture, not
solos. At times it seemed the players were operating at different speeds:
drummer Larry Bright and the guitars fast; tubas, flute and French horn slow.;
   But if the music was challenging, it was also clear and completely
accessible. The packed crowd, almost entirely white and
coffee-house-intellectual-looking, soaked it up with a quiet joy. And the band
had a good time, too. Rojas grinned and bobbed as he and Rodriguez goosed the
beat. Taylor, who blew fiercely and articulately, was often seen cradling his
horn on his chest and gently swaying to the music, smiling beatifically.;

   Lou Reed's new album, ``New York,'' has been
receiving much critical attention because of its unsparing lyrics
about urban blight.
   He has been asked about lyrical content so much, he wonders why
writers don't go beyond the subject and concern themselves with the
poetry in which the lyrics are expressed.
   ``The opening of `Romeo Had Juliette' _ `Caught between the
twisted stars the plotted lines the faulty map that brought
Columbus to New York' _ you've got to admit that's a great opening
line,'' Reed says. ``Forget about what it means and think of the
flow of words. I wish people would notice. Don't you get some kind
of pleasure when you listen to the language?
   ``It's the first song I wrote for the album; it was the standard
for the rest. We had the luxury to go in and test out the studio.
We tested it with `Romeo' and kept the cut we did for the record.''
   Reed talked about his music in an interview at the American
Sound Studio, where he and a band were rehearsing for a tour that
will include an engagement at Broadway's St. James Theater.
   That's a distance from Reed's early, scruffy days in the Velvet
Underground. The group was discovered in 1967 in New York's
underground rock scene by the late pop artist, Andy Warhol, who
promoted them. It remained menacingly non-mainstream and didn't
become commercial. Later, though, it became a role model for punk
rock. Working solo since 1970, Reed has had only one pop hit,
``Walk on the Wild Side,'' in 1973.
   Next November, Reed and John Cale, who also left the Velvet
Underground in 1970, will present an evening of songs in tribute to
Warhol at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
   When he was cutting ``New York'' _ as lyrically street-tough as
ever but accepted in these days of rappers and U2 _ Reed wasn't
expecting media attention.
   ``You can tell from listening we weren't thinking in terms of
radio airplay,'' he said.
   ``Dirty Blvd.'' begins: ``Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel.
He looks out a window without glass. The walls are made of
cardboard newspapers on his feet. His father beats him 'cause he's
too tired to beg.''
   Sire Records wanted to market a single, but Reed said he wasn't
the type of person to sell singles. ``I pushed for `Dirty Blvd.'
because I thought the single should at least be representative of
the album. Look what happened,'' he said.
   ``New York'' is selling better than any previous Lou Reed album,
and is fast climbing the charts.
   A liner note on ``New York'' says, ``You can't beat 2 guitars,
bass, drum.'' The sound of the record was important to Reed, that
the words be understandable and the guitars sound real.
   ``Even though Segovia said an electric guitar is an abomination,
what I like about an electric guitar is it can have all this body
from the wood in it,'' he said. ``We had as one of our goals to
record it so it comes across that way and doesn't sound like a
synthesizer _ thinned out and high endy.
   ``One thing was not to have too many instruments. We wanted my
solos on guitar to be thick and beautiful. We wanted everything to
be heard. Of course, when there's not too many parts, there's
nothing to hide behind. Any mediocrity is heard.''
   His singing is basically talking, and has always been that way.
``In my mind I would like to sing like Otis Redding or Al Green. I
can't, so I had to find a way I could use my range in my style.''
   About the songs, Reed said he doesn't know why he wrote them.
``I didn't sit and say, `I'm going to write about this and this.'
   ``I had pieces of songs. Whatever I get first, I can't change,''
he said. ``I can juggle around with later things, but the first
phrase or line of melody or title I get for a song, I can't change
it. I had the title `Dime Store Mystery' for 20 years. My wife,
Sylvia, said, `When are you going to finish it?' It came up on this
album.
   ``I like that song a lot. It had an odd effect on us when it was
recorded. We were taken someplace else. I can't say where that
someplace was.
   ``I guess people don't expect much out of records. They keep
staying on the plot and asking, `Who do you know in a welfare
hotel?' `Dime Store Mystery' dispenses with plot.''
   Reed said what the album is really about is the use of language.
``That's what I'm really getting off on. There are phrases in there
as good as anything I've ever written.
   ``It is pretty funny, some of it, I thought. It's not endlessly
grim.''
   Reed took part in a benefit concert Paul Simon organized at
Madison Square Garden to buy and equip a medical van to visit New
York welfare hotels. ``Paul bought one with the proceeds of
`Graceland.' Every penny from this concert went to get another
one.''
   Reed has been told that ``Last Great American Whale'' from ``New
York'' will be on a Greenpeace album released in the Soviet Union.
When he's asked if that's a real Indian myth, he says: ``It is now.
It's an American Indian-Jewish myth. In Europe all the great myths
have been taken. Wouldn't it be nice if we could still write a myth
and do it well enough so it held up? I wanted to try to do that.
Why not?''
   Asked about solutions to the big-city problems limned on ``New
York,'' Reed says, ``We only had an hour. We'll get into solutions
on Vol. 2, maybe.''
