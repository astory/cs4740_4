   It's Never Fun, but It's Not Often
   A Dog Bite Is Really a Royal Pain

   LONDON -- Scandalous questions are dogging Britain's Royal
Family: Why are the royal pooches biting the hand that feeds
them? Is there bad blood among the blue-blooded canines?
   Dog behaviorists all over this dog-crazy nation were
seeking answers yesterday after Buckingham Palace tersely
confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II had been bitten on the left
hand by one of her beloved pet corgis. Apparently, the queen,
trying to reassert royal authority, waded into a snarling
pack of 10 corgis who had dropped their palace manners and
were busy thrashing one another.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was the second royal free-for-all involving palace
corgis in the past two years. In 1989, the queen's corgi
Chipper was killed by a corgi pack led by Ranger, a corgi
owned by Queen Elizabeth's mother, known affectionately here
as the Queen Mum. In this case, as well, two of the pooches
apparently belonged to the Queen Mum.
   In the latest incident, which occurred at Windsor Castle,
Her Majesty suffered a nip on a finger and thumb; the wounds
required three stitches. A royal chauffeur was also bitten
while trying to help the queen separate the dogs.
   "The queen is very brave to have done this," says canine
behaviorist Anthony Burley, who shudders to think that the
attack could have been much worse. "To put your hand in
between fighting corgis is to put your hand into a food
mixer." Corgis are a handful -- low, long and strong, with
grown males averaging 20 to 24 pounds.
   Buckingham Palace might have been tempted to let sleeping
dogs lie and refuse to confirm the attack, except that the
queen's injuries were observed publicly for the first time
yesterday when she conducted a 75-minute investiture ceremony
at the palace. Palace observers who were present noted that
she sported plastic bandages on her left thumb and
forefinger.
   While lauding the queen's bravery, dog psychologists were
also gently suggesting to Her Majesty that she consider other
means of restoring order among her dogs. "Grab a tea tray and
bang it loudly over their heads, then drop it between the
dogs," Mr. Burley says. "You need something physical between
them, but it shouldn't be your hand."
   Unanswered is whether the dog that drew royal blood is in
the royal doghouse. But Roger Mugford, the queen's animal
behaviorist, says: "I suspect the dog will be forgiven."

<HEAD>Queen's Dog Dead After Windsor Castle Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dog belonging to Queen Elizabeth II died after
being bitten in a fight with other royal dogs at Windsor Castle,
Buckingham Palace said.
   Chipper, a 12-year-old cross between a dachshund and a corgi,
was involved in a fight started by Ranger, a corgi belonging to
Queen Mother Elizabeth, the palace said Friday.
   The crossbreed, known as a dorgi, was stitched up after the
fight by a veterinarian but died, the palace said.
   The queen was given a corgi by her parents in the 1930s when she
was a little princess. They became the royal family's most popular
house dogs because of their small size but palace staff and
visitors say the dogs tend to snap at ankles.
   Princess Margaret, the queen's sister, preferred dachshunds.

<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II's corgi dogs are being treated
by an animal psychologist because of their bad record of nipping
members of the royal household, The Mail on Sunday reported.
   The paper said guardsmen, policemen, footmen and even the royal
clockwinder have fallen prey to the corgis' nips.
   Buckingham Palace refused comment. ``I don't think we'd like to
comment on that kind of story,'' said a palace spokesman who by
custom was not identified.
   The dogs are being seen by animal behavior specialist Dr. Roger
Mugford, who firmly believes in counseling owners as well, The Mail
on Sunday said.
   Mugford, whose office was closed Sunday, was quoted by the paper
as saying of corgis: ``They are, of course, collie-type dogs,
originally bred for cattle herding. As such, they will chase
anything, particularly ankles.''
   The present generation of royal corgis, according to the paper,
are named: Spark, Mist, Sable, Diamond, Kelpie, Phoenix, Piper,
Chipper and Harris. The article did not say how many of the dogs are
receiving treatment.

FT  15 FEB 92 / A dog's life at Buck House: As they say in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY foreign correspondent in London has seen the BBC film that celebrated
the 40th anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne, Elizabeth R, or
Isabel R as she is known in Spain.
Isabel, Felipe, Carlos and Ana are familiar figures there: Spitting Image,
the coarse British satirical television programme, has a wide audience. Such
are the realities of the New Europe. So Enric Gonzalez in El Pais was
writing for a well-informed readership in his useful summary of the Queen's
decades.
'Elizabeth has seen the disappearance of the Empire, the hard recovery of
the 1950s, the cultural revolution of the '60s, the trade union torments of
the '70s and the petty bourgeois Thatcherite insurrection of the '80s
without altering her routine.' The heart of this routine is tea. The Queen
always takes tea with her corgis, 'for whom she personally mixes meat and
biscuits which the little animals eat on the red carpets of her private
homes.'
Corgis were fully researched for Bernhard Heimrich's account in the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. 'Corgis are short-legged, bustling little
dogs from Wales, which in the handbook are described as ideal for the
farmyard, vigilant guardians and good comrades. The queen has six corgis,
which she feeds with meat and biscuits every day at half past four.'
Heimrich finds the British almost as interesting as the corgis. He says that
a third of us dream about the Queen, and most of the dreams include drinking
tea with the monarch - sans corgis. So we enter the British subconscious,
and a dark place it proves to be:
'The second surprise (after the dreams) is that it is mainly night in the
Reich of Elizabeth II. This has been recognised for some time but has not
been fully accepted. On the Empire of her predecessor the sun never set. The
four decades of Queen Elizabeth II encompass the British generation which
has to abandon this dream, and the Queen as a dream figure behind the walls
of her palace in the middle of British reality, is there to help.'
Le Monde's correspondent, Laurent Zecchini, emerges as a hitherto
unimaginable entity - a French Barbara Pym. He too reports the dream of
taking tea with the Queen. 'In the collective unconscious of her people, the
Queen keeps her place at the centre of a pile of useless little things,
dusty but essential, which make Great Britain in the eyes of so many people
the vestal priestess of the cult of memories . . .'
The elegiac theme then really takes hold: 'Forty years, and always that
certain smile - a little fixed, this great professionalism, this intangible
etiquette, these prime ministers who succeed one another for the invariable
tea and conversations of no importance.'
The Italians care little for psychological speculation, and less for tea, or
even corgis. They are interested in not paying income tax. So in Il Sole-24
Ore, Alessandro Merli, with his usual good taste, celebrated 40 glorious
years of getting away with it. He reverently asked: 'Is the Queen of England
the UK's biggest tax evader?'
Merli noted that earlier monarchs had indeed paid income tax. He then ran
through the figures on the Queen's wealth and income and concluded she could
well afford to pay. But he has fears about the succession: her non-payment
of tax 'does not mean that Prince Charles, who likes to appear in the
forefront of 'inner city' causes, will not start doing it again.'
That will not satisfy the royalist Zecchini in Le Monde: 'The Queen will
have to find a recipe for a sort of neo-monarchy for the next century, an
alchemy which will bring together modernity and tradition. In the next
decade the Queen will celebrate her golden jubilee and her 75 years. Until
then, without any doubt, 'God Save the Queen.''

DELIGHTFUL GIFTS FOR FRIENDS OR EVEN YOURSELF
IT'S A ROYAL LIFE: BOOK LOOKS INSIDE BUCKINGHAM
PALACE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story; See also related article on page 1D of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     These rooms and the lifestyles of those who live in and pass through them
are the focus of "Inside Buckingham Palace, The Private World of the Royal
Family" by Andrew Morton (Summit Books, $20). This coffee-table style book,
with its beautiful photographs, is hard to put down, even if you don't follow
all the gossip about the royal family.;   "People see Buckingham Palace as a
personification of mystery and majesty," says Morton, who has spent more than
a decade chronicling the comings and goings of Charles, Diana, Fergie and
all.;   "The palace is the center for national rejoicing and sorrow," he says.
"It was the place people ran to on the day the second World War ended. It's a
national rallying point and the royal family has come to symbolize universal
values of duty, obligation and family life.";   Life inside the palace,
according to Morton, is as different and extreme as any commoner might expect.
It takes three days to set the table for a major banquet, using place settings
valued at $5,400 each, and another three days to wash up. A system of traffic
lights keeps the footmen, pages and butlers who serve and clear from
colliding. And there are two men who do nothing but tend to the winding and
servicing of the 300 clocks in the house.;   There are rooms set aside for
everything from television and radio broadcasts to a bedroom for the queen's
pet corgi dogs. One of the most fascinating is the Gift Room, so-called
because this is where the queen goes to choose gifts she wants to give
someone.;   "It's her own personal shop inside the palace," Morton says.
"Obviously she hasn't time to go shopping. There is lots of porcelain and the
gifts range from the simplest things like a waste basket to little silver
holders you put glasses of tea in.";   Morton divides the interior of the
palace into three areas. "The staff areas are like government offices or the
back rooms of a large hotel, without any glitter or glitz. There are the state
apartments which have polish -- red carpet, mirrors, Regency furniture and
gilt. And the private quarters, which are more comfortable and cozy." The
latter, he says, "contain the kinds of things they like -- pink carnations in
the queen's room and pictures she's chosen herself. Fergie's room has teddy
bears and a helicopter helmet and Fisher-Price toys all over the place.";   In
describing the private areas, Morton makes no attempt to hide his disdain for
the fact that Fergie has almost no closet space. "It's ridiculous -- you have
the premier duchess in the land with her clothes on hangers outside in the
red-carpeted corridor, but she likes Buckingham Palace because it's
comfortable, near her friends, away from prying eyes, and she can enjoy
herself away from the public.";   Authoritative as he is on Buckingham Palace,
Morton's visits have been confined to a narrow area that does not include even
the Centre Room, let alone the private quarters he describes in such vivid
detail.;   "After every book I write, the courtiers have a little inquiry on
how on earth I got such accurate information," he boasts. "It's because of
contacts. I've cultivated people in key positions like any specialist would.";
  Would Morton pay for information?;   He pauses slightly and says, "I'd
haggle.";   A testimony to his sleuthing is the detailed floor plan of the
principal and bedroom floors of the palace. "It's not well-known at all, but I
wanted to print the layout of the private quarters so people could get an idea
of it," he says.;   Morton has yet to hear what the queen or Scotland Yard
thinks about it, but he is pleased to reveal that one of his previous books,
about the Royal Yacht Britannia, was such a hit that "the queen gave lots of
copies away as Christmas presents.";   While they live in lavish surroundings,
the royal family is anything but lavish in their personal spending habits.
"There is no conspicuous consumption in the way of Donald Trump or that
Helmsley woman (Leona)," Morton says. "It's not the kind of family where you
could accuse them of living extravagantly. Everything is of the finest
quality, but they keep whatever they have for a long time, longer than you and
I.";   Fan that he admits he is, Morton still believes the economy kick is
taken too far at times. "It's ridiculous," he says. "You have Diana and Fergie
and the children using a local hotel's swimming pool because the queen hasn't
spent the money on a pool at Balmoral. It's the same at Sandringham. You have
the richest woman in the world not having a swimming pool!";   The pampered
life led by the queen and her family, with someone always there to run the
bath water, lay out their clothes and help them dress, has made them, in
Morton's words, "a bit helpless. They're institutionalized. I don't mean that
in a nasty or negative way. Quite frankly, I'd feel a bit daunted if my day's
schedule said at 10:30 you'll hold an investiture, at noon you'll meet an
ambassador, at 2 you meet the prime minister, at 3 you do a walkabout and that
evening you host a dinner. If you've never done it before in your life, it's
the same way if you've never run a bath or pressed your clothes. They're bred
to a certain kind of function.";   Morton started covering the royal family
while working as a Fleet Street reporter.;   Three years ago Morton gave up
his newspaper job to start Palace Press, which specializes in covering the
royal family. He readily agrees most people view the topic he has chosen as
"very trivial, but once you get into it, it's a very interesting subject
because it touches on many areas of society from an anthropological,
sociological and historical viewpoint.";   While Morton's latest book is on
the palace itself and the lifestyle within the walls, you can't resist asking
his opinion of the constant rumors about Prince Charles and Princess Diana's
marriage.;   "There's always going to be rumors because of the 13-year age
gap," he says. "They have separate interests, a separate circle of friends and
separate timetables. I saw them in Canada, but they didn't seem to be happy.
Only people within a marriage can say how it is from day to day and month to
month."  </TEXT>

FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: Royals on the dole - Alastair Macaulay reviews The
Queen and I, on stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Name? 'Elizabeth Windsor.' (A Social Services officer is interviewing the
next woman in line for an emergency supplementary payment.) 'Address?'
'Number Nine Hellebore Close' 'Former address?' 'Buckingham Palace, The
Mall.' 'What were you doing there?' 'I was being the Queen.' 'You were in an
institution? We can't give you any money.'
Sue Townsend's 1992 bestseller The Queen and I is a dark joke, a barbed
dream of republicanism in which Mrs Elizabeth Windsor and family learn to
live in the modern hell of a council estate in the Midlands. Now it has
become a play, which has just had its premiere, neatly, in the Midlands (at
the Leicester Haymarket), and will tour England and Wales before reaching
London's Royal Court on June 7. The play is different in many details from
the novel. Updated to suit recent Royal developments, and including a few
songs (too few - phew - to qualify it as a musical), it is funny, touching,
shrewd.
Part of the fun of The Queen and I (on page or stage) is to do with Royal
gossip. How would Margaret cope? Philip? The answer in either case is
wickedly amusing. In the stage version the adulterous Charles, who has been
allocated a single person flat, soon shacks up with Leanne, the most
promiscuous girl on the estate, and becomes a good dad to her illegitimate
baby. Diana starts a flirtation with Fitzroy, a local black, and works out
with him ('Once your muscle tone goes, you may as well be dead'). The stage
Queen and I is also mildly feminist: which leads to its funniest scene - a
women's group in which Liz, Diana and neighbours practise assertiveness -
and its best song, What Makes the Husbands Leave Home?' And the fact that
Liz Windsor herself turns out to be matey, outspoken, decent, hard-working,
will please royalists as well as republicans.
But the stage version of The Queen and I is more overtly socialist than the
novel. Some of its stylised versions of gangland chants are trite - a
simplistic effort to understand the gang mentality that sounds in fact
condescending. Elsewhere, however, the realities of council estate life are
caught with realism, as well as humour. It proves both gratifying and
credible (not to mention ironic) that, on her first Christmas Day in her new
home, Mrs Windsor of Hell(ebore) Close, rallies and makes a televised speech
to the nation - no, not the Queen's Speech, de haut en bas, but the reverse:
a pensioner's appeal on behalf of those who, like herself, are making do on
inadequate benefits.
Max Stafford-Clark directs. The fun of all the performances lies less in
their precision of Royal mimicry (though Doon Mackichan makes very witty use
of Diana's tricks with her eyes) than in the impish vigour with which they
bring them to life. Thus Mrs Philomena Toussaint (David Howey) and Mrs Vi
Toby (Carole Hayman) become as vivid to us as their ex-Royal neighbours. The
songs, by Mickey Gallagher and Ian Dury, are the least surefire element of
the show. A certain glee comes from hearing the Windsors and their
neighbours do a rap number, but less than you might hope.
The fine cast is led by Pam Ferris as the Queen - an outstanding
performance. She brings out some surprisingly serious dimensions. Talking
nostalgically to a vision of her old nanny, she suddenly exclaims softly,
'Crawfie - we lived in Paradise'. The line - a gentle echo of Lear's 'I have
ta'en too little care of this' - brings a real pang. At the same time, she
is as good as everyone else in the play's element of naughty caricature. The
way she uses her corgi on that Social Services officer (you have to see
this) is the play's funniest moment.
The Queen and I continues at the Haymarket, Leicester, until April 16. In a
double bill with Jim Cartwright's Road, it tours to Bath, Cardiff, Hull,
Woking, Blackpool, Norwich and the Royal Court Theatre, London.

TENNIS lessons. Chess lessons. My life at present is a whirlwind of
instruction. Yesterday it was a chess lesson, one of a series that I and two
friends are having to prepare ourselves for the Nigel Short-Gary Kasparov
world chess tussle in London in September. The two friends are: John Major,
prime minister of Britain, and Queen Elizabeth II, head of the House of
Windsor. Our instructor is Nigel Short himself. We meet in utmost secrecy.
Unusually, the Queen was accompanied by the Seven Dwarfs, her seven Welsh
corgis, who are notorious, at Buckingham Palace, for savaging the flunkies.
But the Queen soon settled them. Before the lesson started she produced
seven silver bowls into which she spooned caviar. The dwarfs gobbled it
greedily and collapsed in a malevolent heap.
'That's put paid to them,' she said. 'Nigel - let us start. One must get
away on time. There are more ructions brewing - more media allegations.
Where will it all end? Not that one isn't inured. No es para tanto.'
'Right-ho,' said Nigel, whose own mental and physical preparation for his
match against Kasparov the barbarian is proceeding smoothly. 'Today I
thought we'd study sacrificial play in the middle-game, especially
sacrificial play aimed at destroying our opponent's defensive structure.
Remember my golden rule: before launching any sort of attack, sacrificial or
otherwise, always count the number of pieces you will be attacking with and
try to ensure it exceeds the number of pieces your opponent will be
defending with.'
Nigel said he would show us a game he played against Agdestein in 1987,
involving the Greek bishop sacrifice. With grandmasterly finesse he set up
the pieces and moved them at great speed, so that all we could see was a
blur of pawns and bishops and cleverly skulking knights.
'Right,' said Nigel. 'This brings us to move 14. From here, play went: 14,
Bxh7+, Kxh7; 15, Ng5+, Kg8; 16, Qd3, Rfe8. So how did play continue?'
John Major wriggled and frowned. 'I must say, Nigel,' he said, 'that
sacrificial play leaves me with feelings of considerable unease. It does not
seem logical to throw away a perfectly stalwart piece when you are doing
jolly well anyway and embark upon a course of action that is little short of
reckless. It reminds me of politics. I am being urged at the present time to
sacrifice Norman Lamont, my chancellor of the exchequer. But as Michael has
pointed out, alone among his colleagues, Norman is a hero, a man of
considerable stature. Why should I cast him out?'
The Queen trilled with merriment. 'In one's own line of business,' she said,
'one gets accustomed to stratagems, especially mid-game sacrifices. You work
to five-year terms. A monarch thinks in centuries. Qui non proficit deficit.
Anyway, the answer to Nigel's little teaser is strikingly obvious. What
follows must be: 17, Qh7+, Kf8; 18, f5] . . . '
'Absolutely brill,' said Nigel. 'Exactly how it happened. Then I put the
boot in. It was completely open house.'
'Nigel]' exclaimed the Queen. 'One wishes you hadn't said that. Completely
open house. That is one's current strategem, one's sop to the
anti-monarchists, but one would rather you didn't remind one. Can you
imagine the mess and noise when Buckingham Palace is thrown open to the
populace this summer? One is dreading it entirely. And what will they be
gawking at? Just a load of art works, mainly dusty pictures. One is sending
the dwarfs to Scotland. They are liable to go berserk.'
I had been quiet until now, but I could not resist the opening. I said: 'I
agree with the character in Barry Unsworth's novel, Stone Virgin, who says,
in all seriousness, that great works of art are more important than people -
that life can spawn more life, but that you can't spawn Gothic Madonnas.
'Look at the floods in Venice in 1966, which triggered off countless
restoration projects and set the money flowing. 'If it hadn't been Venice,'
says this character, 'if there had only been people to worry about, what
would anyone have done? I'll tell you. They would have sent a few food
parcels and forgotten all about it'.'
The Queen smiled. She said: 'Michael does go on.' She revived the dwarfs
with smelling salts and telephoned for her car and detective. The rest of us
did the same. So ended our second lesson.

FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: Smashing Pumpkins - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far below the Brixton Academy's cavernous black ceiling, beneath the shadowy
Italianate mock-buildings that decorate its upper walls, 1,000, perhaps
2,000 young people crush together, often crash together, illuminated
occasionally by harsh white lights from the stage. Bodies rise, feet first,
from this churning sea and are passed from hand to hand before sinking
again. From time to time the mass raise their arms and point as one towards
the front of the stage on which stand three skinny individuals lit in lurid
greens, reds, blues holding guitars.
The noise is overpowering, a screaming, thudding, relentless assault not
just on the ears but on the body. This is the Smashing Pumpkins
emphatically affirming its status as one of the hottest alternative rock
bands. It is a highly enjoyable experience. (Although it helps to have been
put in the mood by security guards whose purpose in life is to stop
passholders seeing the concert.)
What lifts the band above most of its contemporaries is its ability to use
the limited and increasingly hackneyed vocabulary of loud thrash guitar rock
to express a distinctive musical personality.
On Siamese Dream, the latest album, the Pumpkins vary the pace with
moderately complex arrangements, acoustic guitar and even a dash of cello.
Live, such signposts of subletly are abandoned for simple churn and kerrang.
The effect is visceral. The fact that the speakers are so loud that every
bass note feels like a punch in the stomach has something to do with it, but
although other bands play as loud, few are as emotionally engaging.
The assault is not unrelenting. The lull in the storm is one of leader Billy
Corgan's favourite tricks. The wall of guitar noise from Corgan and James
Iha abates, to expose the powerful skeleton of the Pumpkins' music: the
edgy, sinuous, crunching rhythm of D'Arcy, the bass player, and drummer
Jimmy Chamberlin. The effect can be disconcerting. When 'Today' begins in
relative calm, the audience chants the lyrics with Corgan, a sort of
singalong-a-max-volume, before it builds to a roar that drowns even singing
along in your head.
Each song is distinctly sculpted from the noise and the brief abatement of
noise. Each possesses its own crushing logic. But the ceaseless ebb and flow
in the tidal wave of noise prevents the set as a whole building momentum.
The effect is too controlled. It is a relief when the Pumpkins finish the
set by smashing through 'Cherub Rock' in one unbroken surge.
The encore is also reassuring. It is a shambles. Corgan emerges in a clown
suit and after 'Spaceboy' - so laid back it even contains some bottleneck
guitar from Iha - the control evaporates halfway through the next song which
starts with a surge of adrenalin and dribbles to an end with Corgan
hectoring the audience in enjoyable ego-crazed rock-star style. After a
confusing final blast of parody power chords they are gone. The audience
seems unsure whether to laugh or cheer and stands as if stunned until
someone turns the house lights on.

Mattel to Acquire Corgi Toys: The Hawthorne company said it will acquire Corgi 
Toys Ltd., a British concern that produces miniature cars and models, for an 
undisclosed price. The announcement comes two weeks after Mattel, which will 
sell more than $1 billion worth of toys this year, reported strong revenue for 
the Christmas season with a continuation of 1989's 25% sales growth. Corgi has 
annual revenue of about $20 million.

   LONDON -- Chief Inspector Jan Eachus stares past thick
bars at the suspect he dragged in the previous night, after a
fierce street fight. The suspect, known only as Bella, glares
back through smoldering black eyes. Bella doesn't have a rap
sheet, but Mr. Eachus knows this isn't her first offense.
"Just look at those scars," he says, pointing at raw marks
across Bella's powerful shoulders. "No question this one's
been in a scrap before."
   Mr. Eachus will tell this to the judge as evidence that
Bella, an American pit bull terrier, shouldn't have been
allowed to roam uncontrolled. Bella's handler could be fined
more than $3,000 or imprisoned for up to six months. Bella,
who ripped open a dachshund's throat and bit its owner's
hand, will pay the ultimate price. "See ya in doggy heaven,"
says Mr. Eachus, watching Bella gnaw at the bars of her cage.
Asked if there's anything a pit bull such as Bella won't
bite, Mr. Eachus responds, "A 747 jetliner -- flight."

   England is renowned as a nation of dog lovers, a land
where corgis trail Queen Elizabeth II and where shoppers park
their poodles in a carpeted kennel at Harrods department
store. Queen Victoria even shared her deathbed with a
Pomeranian. But England's long affair with dogs has soured.
Aggressive breeds such as pit bulls and Rottweilers are
suddenly in vogue, and as their numbers have risen, so have
reports of dog attacks. The result is public panic,
Parliamentary debate and press headlines suggestive of "The
Hound of the Baskervilles":
   "Devil Dog Scars Tot"
   "Girl, 8, Scalped in Dog Horror."
   England isn't the first country to do battle with
dangerous dogs, but it may be unique in the lethal force it
is deploying. Some animal wardens are arming themselves with
riot shields, chain mail, and ultrasonic stun guns. "Heroes
get bit," explains Mr. Eachus, an inspector with the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA),
which is often called to handle vicious dogs. In a country
where gun control is so strict that most police go unarmed,
Mr. Eachus is licensed to pack a .32 automatic pistol in his
van.
   "We need that kind of weaponry to control humans, not
dogs," Micky Niego, an official with the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says of the varied
English arsenal. Some U.S. wardens carry tranquilizing darts
and Mace, but most prefer nets and rods with loops.
   The English say their situation demands special tactics.
Unlike the U.S., where rabies has led to tight animal
control, England is free of the disease and has no dog
licensing, no leash law and, in many areas, no dog wardens.
England's pet-obsessed public also can be feral in defending
animal rights. "The English worry more about the welfare of
poor little pooch than they do about the safety of Joe
Public," says Mr. Eachus, an American who has been living in
England since 1977.
   The English also resist the notion that some breeds may be
tough to tame. "People think a little loving care will turn
pit bulls into nice pets," says Roger Mugford, an animal
psychologist in London. "They're wrong." Mr. Mugford echoes
the view of many English experts in describing the dogs as
fearless, almost immune to pain, "and able to turn from
playful jokers into psychopathic killers without a moment's
warning."
   Some dog warriors are taking no chances. Standing beside
her van in the north England city of Bradford, Pat Harwood
dons the latest in canine battle dress. Long blond curls
vanish beneath a visored helmet designed for riot control by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Hands slip into
elbow-length gloves. She cradles a reinforced plastic
"Armadillo Tactical Riot Shield," used by police to repel
missiles. Her tall frame is enveloped by a zip-up jump suit,
lined with chain mesh and heavily padded.
   "I feel like I'm inside a Brillo Pad," says the warden,
her voice muffled by the helmet's visor. Ms. Harwood uses the
suit only for emergencies, but she never patrols without her
"Dazer," a pocket-sized weapon designed to startle dogs with
a high-frequency squeal. "It's important to intimidate," says
her boss, senior warden Terry Singh.
   Some say such gladiators are barking up the wrong tree.
"If you approach a pit bull looking like a creature from
Mars, he's more likely to go berserk and bite you," says
Kevin McNicholas, a veteran London dog warden.
   Answering a call on his van's radio phone, Mr. McNicholas
races to a suburban home whose residents are alarmed by a
gnashing sound from an adjoining yard. He finds a huge German
shepherd ripping apart the fence between the two yards with
its fangs. When the dog bounds toward him, Mr. McNicholas
kneels, clicks his tongue and slips a rope around the dog's
neck. "It doesn't need to be Waterloo every time you take a
dog in," he says, calmly guiding the animal into his van.
   On another call, an anxious woman points into her
neighbor's yard, where two dummies hang from trees, their
pants legs in shreds. The woman says her neighbors often
stand in the yard shouting "Kill]" as two pit bulls tear the
effigies apart. Mr. McNicholas's advice: If the dogs come
close, stand perfectly still, avoid eye contact, and, if
possible, whimper like a puppy. "Dog biscuits also help," he
says. The most lethal weapon he has ever employed is a fire
extinguisher. In eight years of service, he hasn't been
bitten.
   Many other officials haven't been so lucky. There were
7,717 dog attacks on mailmen last year; dozens of police were
injured. London police also are receiving twice as many calls
about dangerous dogs as they did just six months ago. While
fatal attacks remain rare (one or two a year compared to an
average of 15 in the U.S.), there now are an estimated
500,000 strays on English streets and crowded dog pounds with
cages marked "Mad] Take Care]"
   Despite strong lobbying by police, postmen, the RSPCA and
other groups, Parliament narrowly rejected a dog registration
law in May. But the government now is considering banning
some breeds, or requiring that such dogs be muzzled in
public. "It sounds like hysteria until a Rottweiler chews
your kid to pieces," says Bill Wadman-Taylor, a veterinarian
and head of the Battersea Dogs Home in London.
   Bill Edmond, head of Britain's Kennel Club, says the RSPCA
and other groups are overreacting. "The problem is people,
not dogs," he says. "Irresponsible owners can make any dog
vicious." His organization opposes dog licensing and other
restrictions "because the people who are neglecting their
dogs, or training them to attack, are the very same people
who won't comply with the licensing law."
   The RSPCA's Mr. Eachus doesn't hesitate to get tough with
both mad dogs and Englishmen. The chain-smoking inspector has
shot two dogs to death and donned riot gear to take in many
others. In his van, he carries a forensic kit containing a
magnifying glass, camera and tweezers to collect evidence
such as dried blood and dogs' hair for use in prosecuting
owners.
   "There's no room for amateurism here," says the veteran
enforcer. He can quote chapter and verse from English dog
law, such as the 1847 statute citing owners for "suffering to
be at large a ferocious unmuzzled dog," and more recent laws
regarding the fouling of sidewalks with what some
euphemistically call "dog-logs."
   Mr. Eachus predicts that the craze for pit bulls and other
macho dogs will peak in a few years, as it has in the U.S. In
the meantime, though, "we need to get dangerous dogs off the
street and their owners behind bars," he says.
   Officials fear, however, that another creature may soon
terrorize England. The RSPCA recently received a panicked
phone call reporting that a wild boar was running amok in a
London street. It turned out to be a Vietnamese pot-bellied
pig, a faddish pet in America that is just now reaching
English shores.

   Raw Chicken Necks?

   Answer: Dogue de Bordeaux,
   A Breed New to Many
   And a True Power Dog

   NEW YORK -- Douglas Quinn was so taken with the phlegmatic
dog star of the movie "Turner &amp; Hooch" that he took out a
classified ad seeking a "Hooch" pup. "I liked the dog, and I
want it. That's all," says Mr. Quinn, a man of few words and
the father of 3 1/2-year-old twin boys in Barry, Ontario. So
far, no response to the ad.
   Just wait till Mr. Quinn finds out that the gargoyle-faced
dogue de Bordeaux can cost as much as $1,800, weighs 125
pounds and craves 12 pounds of raw chicken necks each day,
plus kibble. "It isn't easy to get chicken necks," concedes
Peter Curley, the breeder who supplied four dogs for the
movie, which also stars Tom Hanks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Curley adds that though the dogue may have achieved a
certain vogue thanks to Hollywood, smart (as in fashionable)
doesn't necessarily mean smart (as in intelligent). "The only
thing you can train the Bordeaux to do is eat and sleep,"
says Mr. Curley, who now is branching out to an even rarer
breed: the presa de Canario, known as "the gripping dog" of
the Canary Islands. Mr. Curley expects that strong-jawed
beast to be popular at dog shows and to command maybe $2,500.
   The Bordeaux and the presa are power dogs -- not mere pets
but status symbols. "I'm sure it happens that there are
people who buy dogs like they buy cars," says Peter L.
Borchelt, an animal psychologist in Forest Hills, N.Y.
   Carol Lea Benjamin, a New York author whose book
"Second-Hand Dog" is a paean to the mongrel, notes that
"breeds are often chosen because somebody famous has one" --
the president of the U.S., say, or an admired movie star.
Appreciating that fact, the International Kennel Club, which
is really just a pet store in Manhattan, sometimes manages to
plant items in the gossip columns disclosing that an actor --
Bruce Willis, for instance -- is taking delivery of some
Akita pups or that singer Roberta Flack has a fox-faced shiba
inu. Gilt by association, in other words. It is supposed to
move dogs, and it undoubtedly does.
   People magazine recently predicted that the bichon frise,
a bit of fluff whose name means curly- haired lap-dog, will
be one of the top five dogs of the 1990s, "style-wise." And
in no time at all, Tina Geores, a New Jersey breeder, was
advertising it as "the most stylish dog of the '90s."
   Ms. Geores claims the bichon is getting more and more
popular "with very trendy people, people in show business,"
people like Carly Simon, the singer and songwriter. "They are
such a pleasant little dog," Ms. Geores says. "They're easy
to travel with. They're easy to live with." They cost between
$650 and $1,200.
   The authoritative American Kennel Club, which is not a pet
store in Manhattan, is a little slower on the uptake than
readers of People. It recognizes only 130 breeds, and the
Bordeaux and shiba inu aren't two of them. The AKC each year
lists the top 10 breeds (in terms of registrations), and most
are not exotic power dogs. Cockers and Labs, poodles, golden
retrievers and German shepherds head the list, in that order,
although two currently fashionable breeds, Rottweiler and
chow chow (chow for short), do make the latest top 10.
   "The Rotty is the guard dog of the moment," says John
Mandeville, an AKC judging official. He says the bear-faced
chow is probably the "pre-eminent fad dog." Mr. Mandeville
notes that both dogs tend to be hard to handle, particularly
if they aren't well trained and if the owner isn't assertive.
But, he says, many breed-conscious masters unfortunately
can't see past the pup. "If there's anything cuter than an
eight- or 10-week-old chow puppy, I'm not sure what it is,"
he says. But then one day, the dog owner wakes up to find a
giant, shedding beast (with a blue tongue in the case of the
chow) who wants to be boss. "Cute" can easily enough turn
into "trouble."
   That hasn't kept AKC registrations from reaching an
all-time high, as more Americans seek to spend their mad
money on the perfect dog. The dogue de Bordeaux may not be
it, for a variety of reasons, one of which is that it
originally was bred as a fighting dog. It is said to be good
with children. But it might just have the neighbor's shih tzu
for lunch.
   The border collie (like Mike the Dog in the film "Down and
Out in Beverly Hills") is a current favorite. So are
bulldogs. Jack Russell terriers are popular with the horsy
set. The short-legged Welsh corgi is big (Queen Elizabeth II
has at least one). And so, of course, is the English bull
terrier (thanks to Anheuser-Busch, Bud Light and Spuds
MacKenzie).
   Barbara Bush and the president have been good for English
springer spaniels. Theirs -- Millie and her pups -- have been
good for the Bushes politically. (Yes, Messrs. Reagan, Nixon,
Johnson and Roosevelt had famous dogs, too.) George Bush gave
this advice to a Republican running for Congress in New York:
"One single word. Puppies. Worth 10 points."
   Like politicians, dog breeds have their moment. But the
popular ones get overbred, by puppy mills and others trying
to take advantage of demand. "With anything trendy, there's a
rush to breed for profit," says Mr. Borchelt, the animal
psychologist. "That's no good." Puppy mills turn out dogs
with physical and psychological problems, dogs that can't
handle their aggressive impulses, dogs that bite.
   And ultimately a breed will pass out of fashion, as the
shar-pei seems to be doing now. It is that wrinkly creature
which, as a pup, looks more like a pile of sweat shirts than
a dog.
   On a tour of the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, Mr.
Borchelt is interrupted twice by veterinarians seeking his
advice about their patients. An elderly woman has a "nervous
chow," says one. The other confides: "I've got a problem with
an aggressive shar-pei."
   The Chinese shar-pei, or "sand-skin," was nearly extinct
in the 1950s. But, two decades later, it caught on with the
rare-dog breeders and, in 1983, the Neiman Marcus Christmas
catalog featured a pair of shar-pei pups -- at $2,000 each.
The rage began. Today there are more than 50,000 shar-peis.
The price has come down to as little as $100, a sign that the
fad is about played out. And that's only the half of it.
   "The shar-pei is a veterinarian's dream," says Michael
Marder, a Manhattan vet. "I'm seeing a lot of health and
behavioral problems, not life-threatening but chronic," he
says. Skin trouble is especially common.
   Ethel Petry, of Central Point, Ore., is familiar from an
owner's standpoint with the shar-pei's potential for
ailments. She chose her shar-pei puppy largely because his
front paws were "broken down," and she was afraid the
flat-footed dog would be destroyed.
   Timothy, now three years old, cost her a hundred bucks.
But he was no bargain. His doctor bills have been at least
five times that. He contracted a bad case of mange, and he
tends to be sickly. "He can be playing with you one minute,"
Ms. Petry says, "and come down with a temperature of 104
degees the next."
   Efforts to fix the dog's feet failed, and the little pads
on his paws never toughened up. So, "Timothy is a grass-dog.
I never walk him on the street," says his owner. He travels
by car from his backyard to the park for outings. And at
least once, Ms. Petry has had to carry Timothy in her arms to
keep him off the pavement. Still, she says, "We get along."
   Fortunately, passe power dogs seldom seem to end up at the
pound, abandoned by owners who have traded up to a newer
model. Marjorie Stein, manager of adoption services for the
North Shore Animal League in Port Washington, N.Y., says she
sees few of the exotic breeds: "A chichi dog has a much
better chance of getting a home by word of mouth. Generally,
somebody wants it."

FT  29 AUG 92 / Please leave me alone, Fergie: Dominic Lawson wishes the
royals would stop interfering with him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS 'royal tapes' business is the last straw,' said my taxi driver, and I
had to agree. The ever-encroaching invasion of privacy must cease. It is
time that the royal family stopped intruding on our private lives. We may be
only subjects but even under a monarchy we have some rights, above all the
right to be left alone to lead our private lives in peace and quiet, away
from the glare of royal publicity.
The monarch herself, of course, we cannot avoid. Every time we attach a
stamp to an envelope we are obliged to lick the back of the Queen's head, as
if we were a corgi seeking an approving royal pat. Falling asleep at the end
of the day's television on BBC1, one is obliged to wake up and stand to
attention as the national anthem is played at full blast by the BBC Symphony
Orchestra, whose members, I gather, call the tune 'royalties'.
Then there are the intrusive royal garden parties. We live near Buckingham
Palace, so perhaps I am unduly sensitive. But none of our other neighbours,
not even the inhabitants of Victoria's numerous bail hostels, cause as much
local disturbance and disruption.
Of course one can leave London to avoid the din around the Palace. We favour
the south of France, around St Tropez. But this year the Duchess of York and
her financial adviser got there first, and the place now resembles
Bedlam-by-the-sea.
I cannot understand why, when members of the royal family can stay in
countless castles, all with walls high enough to hide behind and thick
enough to soundproof the most amorous affairs, some of their number should
still choose to cavort in a way which we cannot help but see, in gruesome
colour, all over our servants' newspapers.
Worse still was the return of the errant duchess. Again, perhaps I have been
unlucky, but did she and her exuberant friends have to make such a din at
Foxtrot Oscar while we were trying to enjoy a quiet dinner next door at
Tante Claire?
I suppose the rot started in the 1960s, when the Queen - doubtless following
bad advice, rather than acting on her own sound instincts - agreed to make
the royal household into media stars with the BBC film The Family. Suddenly
these remote and austere figures intruded for the first time into our homes,
like uninvited house guests.
In recent years this publicity-seeking has developed in a distinctly
down-market direction. We had the Duchess of York's characteristically
bizarre television promotion, It's a Royal Knock-Out, not to mention the
interminably over-promoted Budgie the Helicopter books.
While the Prince of Wales's publications have been less intrusive, indeed
tastefully obscure, it came as a shock to turn on one's television to see
the heir to the throne cavorting about in the highlands and islands with the
popular TV personality Selina Scott. I would not question the prince's
choice of companion - I, too, consider Scott to be a woman of rare beauty
and intelligence - but could not the future king have left us in peace,
rather than forced us to watch the two of them at peak-time and grind our
teeth in envy at his good fortune? To encourage such resentment is to foment
revolution and the overthrow of the monarchy.
But, as the taxi driver said, the saga of the royal tapes is the final
straw. I have no idea whether the tape purporting to be of the Princess of
Wales talking to a male admirer is in fact a recording of the princess's
voice or not, and the official line from the palace is that they have no
idea either.
But let us suppose that the tape is genuine, as The Sun claims. Surely the
royal family with its enormous and untaxed wealth, can afford a private
telephone exchange. Surely they realise how easy it is to get a crossed line
on British Telecom's outmoded system. How many innocent members of the
general public must over the years have suffered the irritation of suddenly
hearing snatches of conversation between members of the royal family who
ought to know better.
No wonder a retired bank manager, exasperated at having his calls
interrupted, finally lost his temper, recorded his latest crossed royal
line, and handed it to The Sun.
Perhaps this incident will finally teach the royal family their lesson. If
they will only go back to their castles, fill their moats, pull up their
drawbridges and leave us alone, then we will once again love, cherish and
admire them.
God Save The Queen.

   ``Happy Birthday Grandmother England,'' read a
banner carried by one of thousands of admirers outside the London
home of the Queen Mother, who celebrated her 90th birthday Saturday.
   Crowds of fans, some of whom had camped out overnight to get a
better viewing position, were rewarded when she stepped onto the
geranium-framed balcony about 11 a.m. to wave and smile. The Band
of the Coldstream Guards played ``Happy Birthday'' as she appeared.
   The mother of Queen Elizabeth II then emerged to greet the crowd
around Clarence House, the mansion that has been her London home
since she was widowed 38 years ago.
   Dozens of children gathered around her, offering balloons and
bouquets of daisies, zinnias, lilies and baby's breath. She gently
patted the shoulder of each.
   Looking cool and relaxed despite the hot weather, she spent
nearly a half-hour shaking hands and saying ``Thank you'' to the
crowd lined up along police barricades on the mansion's grounds.
   ``It's been marvelous. Everybody has been so kind,'' she said.
   She then walked beyond the house gates, despite the objections
of nervous security guards, to visit with the crowd.
   Nearly anything associated with her pleased the crowd, which
even cheered when her corgi dog appeared at the door to the house.
   ``For me, she is everything that belongs to Britain. She's the
figurehead ... the grandmother to us all. She's absolutely
wonderful,'' said Emily Coughlin, who had waited outside since
Thursday.
   After the appearance, the Queen Mother was joined for lunch by
her daughters, Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret, and her
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

   Kevin Costner, Lloyd Bridges, Goldie Hawn,
Harrison Ford, Jane Fonda, Steve Martin and Danny de Vito seem to
realize it's not easy being green.
   So they're among the big Hollywood stars pumping money into the
sweeping ``Big Green'' environmental initiative on California's
November ballot.
   Entertainers have contributed much of the $1.4 million raised to
support Proposition 128, according to reports filed last week with
the state.
   The initiative, Proposition 128, would phase out the use of
pesticides known to cause cancer, eliminate use of gases that
damage the ozone layer and forbid the cutting of old redwoods. It
also would impose stricter rules to prevent oil spills and set up a
new state agency to enforce environmental laws.
   Opponents, including chemical manufacturers, farmers, grocers
and other business people, say it would fail to clean the
environment while driving up food and energy costs.
   ``If I'm Bruce Willis and I make $6 million a picture it's not
going to hurt me to pay 70 cents more for a gallon of gas,'' said
Don Schrack, a spokesman for the No On 128 Committee.

   Cancellation of local showings of a revival
of the hit musical ``The Fantasticks'' starring Robert Goulet has
prompted the touring company to sue a downtown theater.
   Fantasticks Touring Co., a part of Pace Theatricals Inc. of New
York, filed a lawsuit Friday in Hennepin County District Court. The
suit alleges that publicity for the show was mishandled and seeks
more than $220,000 in damages from the Minneapolis Community
Development Agency, which owns the Orpheum Theater, and from
Theater Live!, its operator.
   According to the lawsuit, the touring company and the Orpheum
agreed in May to present ``Robert Goulet starring in The
Fantasticks.'' Eight performances were scheduled between June 25
and July 1.
   ``The Fantasticks'' is the longest-running show in U.S. theater
history, having opened in a New York off-Broadway theater in May
1960. The musical was supposed to open its first national run in
Minneapolis, but after the shows were canceled, the debut was moved
to Dallas.
   The lawsuit names as defendants Fred Krohn, Theater Live!
president; and Krohn's financial partners, identified in the
complaint only as John and Jane Doe.
   The lawsuit alleges that Krohn and the others failed to carry
out the publicity plan and informed the touring company on June 20
that they would stop promoting the performances. On June 21, the
performances were canceled.
   Krohn said an agreement was never signed and that ``the deal was
in a state of flux before the show.'' He said he had not received a
copy of the lawsuit.

   Detroit Piston John Salley debuts this weekend
with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra _ narrating ``Casey at the
Bat.'' And he says that's as close to baseball as he wants to come.
   ``I don't like the idea of this white thing coming at your head
90 miles an hour,'' said Salley, a forward on the two-time National
Basketball Association champion team.
   Salley said he was happy to do the show, though.
   ``I got time, plus it's cultural. I like all music except heavy
metal,'' he said.
   And his ultimate goal in music?
   ``I just one day want to be able to go to a club, see a piano
and entertain everybody,'' he said. ``I can't say I can sing, but I
can talk a lot of words.''

<HEAD>Tower Of Windsor Castle Damaged By Shifting Foundations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDSOR, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 800-year-old Round Tower at Windsor
Castle, one of Queen Elizabeth II's homes, has been damaged by
shifting foundations, the Department of the Environment said today.
   The castle overlooking the River Thames is reportedly the
queen's favorite home and is one of Britain's top tourist
attractions. The monarch's royal standard is flown from the tower
when she is in residence.
   ``There has been a slight movement to the Round Tower at Windsor
Castle. We are looking into it,'' the government department said in
a brief statement.
   The statement added that the cause was not known and gave no
details about the extent of the damage.
   The Daily Telegraph, which first broke the story, described the
damage to the five-story tower as serious following a shift in its
ancient foundations.
   The London newspaper said the tower moved two weeks ago,
bringing down plaster, causing cracks to appear in the stonework
and jamming a door and two windows.
   It said the queen had inspected the tower. Buckingham Palace
said in a statement: ``The queen is obviously concerned and is
being kept informed.''
   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, live for much of the
year at Buckingham Palace in London but they and their family spend
each Christmas at Windsor Castle. Windsor is 21 miles west of
London.
   The Round Tower is the most imposing feature of the castle. The
foundations of the tower and the rest of its lower part were built
by King Henry II in 1172. The upper part was added 6{ centuries
later in the reign of King George IV.
   The Round Tower is built on a mound thrown up by the Saxons, the
Teutonic invaders who conquered Britain between the 5th and 7th
centuries. They ruled until their army under King Harold was beaten
at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 by Duke William of Normandy, who
then became King William I of England.
   The original castle was built by King William around 1070.

   President Bush had lunch with Queen Elizabeth II
on Thursday, sampled the splendor of Buckingham Palace and smiled
for the cameras at her majesty's command.
   The royal event began with a glitch over the delayed opening of
Barbara Bush's car door, but by the time lunch ended 30 minutes
behind schedule there were smiles all around and the queen told the
president: ``I hope to see you again soon.''
   When the presidential limousine pulled up to the palace's
red-carpeted Grand Entrance, Bush jumped out. But nobody opened
Mrs. Bush's door until the queen, frowning and shaking her head,
raised her voice and said: ``Open it.''
   A U.S. Secret Service agent complied immediately and Mrs. Bush,
wearing an emerald green dress, emerged smiling as though nothing
had happened.
   It was the Bushes' first taste of British royal hospitality and
the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, brought out one of
Britain's biggest tourist attractions _ the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards in their red tunics and bearskin hats.
   The president arrived at Buckingham Palace from talks with Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher at her Downing Street residence.
Escorted by Philip, he inspected a 100-strong honor guard mounted
by the Scots Guards after their band played the U.S. national
anthem.
   ``That was so beautiful,'' Bush told his hosts. ``I have never
heard `The Star-Spangled Banner' being played better.''
   Then he added hastily: ``with all respect to the Marine band.''
   Both couples then went inside, chatting animatedly as they
walked through a few of the palace's 600 rooms on their way to
cocktails with the 30 other luncheon guests.
   Between cocktails and lunch, the Bushes and their royal hosts
slipped out for a quick look at the mainly 17th century Dutch
masterpieces in the palace picture gallery.
   ``It's just us. It's very quiet,'' Bush said in a joking
reference to the cocktail hubbub he left behind.
   As they approached photographers, the queen, wearing a blue and
white striped silk dress, told Bush with a grin: ``Smile.'' He
obeyed.
   Luncheon was served in the ivory and gold Music Room overlooking
the 45-acre palace garden. The magnificent domed room with 18 blue
and gilt columns has been used for many royal christenings
including those of Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, and
Charles' heir, Prince William.
   Flanked by the queen and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Bush
sat down to a meal of smoked salmon mousse, duck with honey and
brandy sauce, broad beans, asparagus and potatoes, artichoke salad
and mango ice cream.
   The three wines included two which the queen served Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife Raisa when they lunched
together at Windsor Castle in April. They are an Alsatian white
Gewurztraminer Dopff 1983 and the queen's private port, Royal
Vintage 1955.
   Buckingham Palace said the queen's choice of wines was
``coincidence.''
   The guests included Mrs. Thatcher's husband Denis, Secretary of
State James Baker III, his British counterpart Sir Geoffrey Howe,
Terry Hands, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Theater,
and Charles Wilson, editor of The Times of London.
   When former President Reagan went to Buckingham Palace just a
year ago for tea with the queen, a U.S. television reporter shouted
questions to him, breeching accepted behavior at formal royal
occasions.
   To avoid a repetition, reporters at the entrance were made to
stand behind a sound-proof glass screen.

   Mikhail Gorbachev today had lunch with
Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle and invited her to visit the
Soviet Union.
   Her office said the queen told Gorbachev she would like to
accept, but her foreign travel is fixed years in advance.
   She would be the first British sovereign to visit the Soviet
Union since the Russian royal family, her cousins, were murdered
after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
   ``Thanking Mr. Gorbachev, Her Majesty explained that the program
for her visits were fixed a number of years in advance. She hoped
it would be possible to visit the Soviet Union in due course,'' a
Buckingham Palace statement said.
   The announcement came as the Soviet leader left Windsor Castle
for London's Heathrow Airport to return home at the end of a
40-hour visit to Britain.
   Earlier, Gorbachev and his wife Raisa drove to the majestic
castle on the Thames River in drizzling rain.
   Maj. Nicholas Parsons invited the Kremlin leader in fluent
Russian to inspect a guard of honor of bearskin-capped Coldstream
Guards.
   The queen, in bright pink skirt and cape, and her husband,
Prince Philip, greeted her guests on the castle doorstep.
   Gorbachev was the first Soviet leader since 1967 to meet the
queen, and by putting the royal seal on his 40-hour visit to
Britain, he clearly hoped to enhance the benign image he is trying
to implant in Western minds.
   Windsor Castle, the palace 20 miles west of London, has been a
royal residence for more than 800 years, and the queen took the
Gorbachevs on a tour of some of its rooms and held a lunch in their
honor.
   The 34 guests, including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
her husband Denis, ate smoked salmon cornets filled with crabmeat,
layers of fillet of beef, duck puree and sliced artichoke, all
baked in pastry.
   Earlier today, Gorbachev delivered a major televised policy
speech in the oak-paneled, chandeliered splendor of Guildhall, for
800 years the seat of London city government.
   Like many of Britain's archaic institutions, the Guildhall's
power is more in its looks than in its powers. Like Queen Elizabeth
II, the Guildhall and its lord mayor are restricted largely to
ceremonial duties.
   The Gorbachevs arrived at the Guildhall in a 24-car motorcade
through the congested streets of the City, London's financial
district, where the lord mayor, Alderman Sir Christopher Collett,
waited, resplendent in black, gold-braided robes and three-corner
hat.
   Gorbachev was escorted into the building in a procession led by
the mayor, the sergeant at arms and officials bearing a sword and a
gold mace, symbol of city authority.
   A trumpet fanfare announced the Gorbachevs' entry into the hall,
and they stood beside Mrs. Thatcher and her husband Denis as the
Soviet and British anthems were played.
   An array of dignitaries packed the hall, ranging across the
political spectrum from Mrs. Thatcher through Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie to Bruce Kent, chairman of the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament.
   Pikemen, musketeers, sheriffs and city elders in blue robes
stood by to complete the pageant.

<HEAD>Intruder Arrested In Buckingham Palace Mews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drunken youth penetrated security devices
designed to protect the royal family and was arrested about 200
yards from Buckingham Palace, Scotland Yard said early Monday.
   The Yard, headquarters of the metropolitan police, said the
incident occurred Sunday morning. It said no further action was
planned against the youth, who was released after being cautioned
for being drunk and disorderly.
   The Yard declined to give the youth's name, address or age. It
also would not detail how he got into the royal mews, which serves
as stable and garage for Queen Elizabeth II's 30 carriage horses,
coaches and cars.
   He was arrested in the mews, about 200 yards from the palace.
   The mews is normally entered from Buckingham Palace Road through
a huge pair of doors set in a high wall topped with spikes, barbed
wire, alarms and remote control cameras.
   The palace said the queen was not at Buckingham Palace at the
time of the intrusion.
   She was at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London, where the
royal family often prefers to spend weekends.
   Security at 650-room Buckingham Palace and its 45 acres of
grounds was improved after an unemployed drifter, Michael Fagan,
climbed a drainpipe in 1982 to reach the queen's bedroom, sat on
her bed and spoke to her before he was nabbed.
   A jury found Fagan innocent of stealing a bottle of Californian
wine which he drank during a break-in at the palace earlier in
1982. He was never charged with breaking in to the palace because
it was regarded as trespassing, a civil offense, and the palace
wouldn't take him to court.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev followed in the
footsteps of the czars and came to Queen Elizabeth II's castle on
Friday, then asked the question Britons have been speculating about
for months.
   He asked the monarch if she would come to Moscow. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said the queen gave ``a very definite yes.''
   Winding up his two-day visit, the Soviet leader sampled
old-fashioned British pageantry _ first in the oak-paneled splendor
of the Guildhall, for 800 years the seat of London city government,
then in majestic Windsor Castle overlooking the River Thames.
   Elizabeth will be the first British monarch to visit the Soviet
Union since the revolution that ousted the czars and brought the
communists to power.
   The invitation has great implications because of the close
kinship of the Russian and British royal families. Czar Nicholas
II, a cousin of the queen's grandfather, was murdered with his
family in 1918, ending the Romanov dynasty.
   The queen's reaction sounded somewhat guarded. A Buckingham
Palace statement said: ``Thanking Mr. Gorbachev, Her Majesty
explained that the program for her visits were fixed a number of
years in advance. She hoped it would be possible to visit the
Soviet Union in due course.''
   But Mrs. Thatcher, whose government has the final word on
approving or rejecting a visit, said: ``It's a very definite yes.''
She added the queen was ``very positive, very glad, very happy''
about the invitation.
   In November, a month before Gorbachev originally was scheduled
to visit Britain, reports of a Soviet prospective invitation to the
queen started circulating and Mrs. Thatcher let it be known she
thought it was too soon to give such a resounding stamp of approval
to the Soviet leader's reform plans.
   At a news conference in London Friday night, Soviet officials
were asked whether the palace or British government had insisted
the Soviets apologize for the treatment of the Russian royal family
before the queen accepted the invitation.
   Yevgeny Primakov of the Soviet Institute of World Economic and
International Politics said there were ``no preconditions on either
side.''
   He said Soviets are reasessing their history but added: ``This
is not the point. This is an invitation to a head of state of a
country with which we are trying to find points of convergence.''
   Gorbachev was driven to Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London
_ the first Soviet leader since 1967 to visit the queen.
   In drizzling rain, he took the Royal Salute from the Guard of
Honor mounted by the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards. The captain
then reported to Gorbachev in Russian and the Soviet leader,
carrying his hat in his hand, reviewed the troops clad in gray
greatcoats and bearskin hats.
   The queen, wearing a pink cape and matching skirt, then took
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, on a quick tour of the palace _ past
relics from the Crusades, medieval knights on horseback, King Henry
VIII's suit of armor, and a painting of the Russian Emperor
Alexander I. Gorbachev beamed in recognition.
   The party made a brief detour to enable Gorbachev to look at a
malachite vase given to Queen Victoria by Czar Nicholas I.
   Nicholas I was the first of the czarist cousins to come to
Windsor, spending three days in June 1844 as Victoria's guest.
Alexander II, the future Alexander III, and the future Nicholas II,
were also entertained at Windsor by the British royals.
   Buckingham Palace said Gorbachev invited the queen to visit the
Soviet Union over a lunch of smoked salmon, pastry filled with
layers of beef, duck puree and artichoke and avocado salad, and
three wines.
   The 34 guests included Mrs. Thatcher and her husband, Denis, and
the queen's youngest son, Prince Edward, who will be visiting
Moscow next week with the National Youth Theater.
   Lord St. John of Fawsley, a constitutional expert, said the
invitation ``will cement the very warm relationship between
ourselves and the Soviet Union. I think it will put an end to all
tensions that could have come from the memories of the
assassination of the czar and I think the queen will have a very
ecstatic reception.''
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's peerage,
said the queen should insist that the Soviets disclose where Czar
Nicolas II and his family are buried, and that she be allowed to
pay her respects.
   ``The fact that the queen could see the graves of her relations,
and repair the damage done after the Russian Revolution in a
Christian and religious way, would perhaps bring these countries
closer together than anyone ever thought possible,'' he said.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s computer business and its Unix operating system got a big boost Friday when the company won an estimated $929 million Air Force contract. 

   The award provides AT&amp;T with much-needed credibility in the computer industry, analysts said, and is likely to be used by the telephone giant as a major marketing tool. 
AT&amp;T executives said the contract with options runs for eight years and could be worth more than $4.5 billion if the Defense Department and civilian agencies order their authorized limits for equipment, software and services. 

   The Air Force contract, one of the government's largest computer orders ever, had been closely watched by the computer industry. 
The size of the contract helped create a major industry fight over future computer standards, because the Air Force required bidders to offer systems compatible with Unix, an operating system developed and licensed by AT&amp;T that has become increasingly popular as the base level of software controlling operations on engineering workstations, many minicomputers and some personal computers. 

   Digital Equipment Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc., for instance, didn't bid after protesting against the Air Force's requirement of compatibility with AT&amp;T's latest version of Unix-Unix System V. 

   Robert Kavner, president of AT&amp;T's Data Systems Group, said he hopes the contract will help AT&amp;T reach an agreement with the Open Software Foundation, a computer group challenging the company's control of Unix. 
The group has pledged to develop a system using International Business Machines Corp.'s Unix version, AIX, which isn't fully compatible with Unix System V. AT&amp;T, in turn, has formed a group to push Unix System V. 

   "This bid doesn't decide the entire marketplace," Mr. Kavner said. 
"But it is an incremental affirmation of our operating system. 
I hope those in OSF will continue to ship Unix System V and feel more and more comfortable it's the route to go." 

   How much business AT&amp;T actually will get from the contract isn't clear. 
Capt. Warren Sypher, a spokesman for the Air Force Communications Command, which announced the contract, said he understood its value to be $929 million over eight years. 
However, AT&amp;T executives said that the Pentagon agencies covered by the contract are authorized to spend about $4.5 billion, and that the $929 million estimate covers only the first two years. 

   Whatever its final value, the win gives AT&amp;T's computer business a shot in the arm. 
AT&amp;T's current computer revenue is about $1 billion annually, analysts estimate, and the unit, which has had losses totaling billions of dollars, isn't expected to become profitable until late next year at the earliest. 

   "They certainly need whatever they can get" in computer orders, said Richard Toole of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
"But I really think their problems in computers will have to be solved by acquisition." 
Mr. Kavner said the contract will help AT&amp;T's Data Systems Group turn profitable sooner than his budget now plans. 

   Air Force officials said IBM, Planning Research Corp., Honeywell Inc., Lockheed Corp. and Zenith Electronics Corp. also bid on the contract. 
One Air Force spokesman said bidding was so competitive that prices were cut by 70%; the Air Force originally estimated its initial purchases would cost $3.5 billion, the spokesman said. 

   An IBM spokesman said the computer giant is disappointed it didn't win. 
"We are going to ask the Air Force for a debriefing to understand why," the spokesman said. 
Any protests would be filed with the General Services Administration, Air Force officials said. 

   Warren G. Corgan, vice president of AT&amp;T's Federal Systems Division, said the contract operates as a catalog, with AT&amp;T supplying a list of about 250 items, including AT&amp;T's 3B2/600 minicomputers, software, maintenance, systems integration and other work. 

   Defense Department agencies will buy the estimated $929 million of gear in the first two years, but can continue buying hardware for an additional three years and maintenance for an additional six years, Mr. Corgan said. 
AT&amp;T has been asked to ship the first 16 minicomputers to the Air Force by Jan. 3, he said. 
The agencies may buy as many as 20,000 AT&amp;T minicomputers, according to AT&amp;T. 

   Meanwhile, Mr. Corgan said, civilian agencies can select items from the catalog after the first year of the contract. 
He estimated that buying by civilian agencies could boost purchases by 10% to 20% above the $4.6 billion of authorized spending by Defense Department agencies. 

   AT&amp;T executives said about 60% of the revenue from the contract will be for AT&amp;T items, which it will start shipping in volume in next year's second quarter. 
AT&amp;T also will supply the government with gear and services from other companies. 
Control Data Corp., for instance, will supply magnetic disk drives, and TRW Inc. will supply engineering and networks linking computers. 

   AT&amp;T last won a major government computer contract three years ago, when it beat IBM for a three-year contract from the National Security Agency with an estimated value at the time of $946 million. 
"This contract dwarfs the NSA contract," Mr. Corgan said. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, AT&amp;T shares rose 75 cents to close at $28.

<HEAD>Princess Beatrice To Be Christened Dec. 20</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Princess Beatrice, the 3-month-old daughter of the
Duke and Duchess of York, will be christened by the Archbishop of
York on Dec. 20, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
   The christening will take place in the historic Chapel Royal in
London's St. James's Palace, where Queen Victoria and Prince Albert
were married in 1840 and where royal christenings occasionally have
taken place.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, will wear the royal
family's christening robe of Honiton lace and will be baptized at
the silver gilt Lily Font, the palace said.
   The font was made for the christening in 1840 of Princess
Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria, and it has been used
to baptize Queen Elizabeth's four children and grandchildren. The
christening robe has been worn by all royal babies since the baptism
of Victoria's eldest son, Prince Albert Edward, in 1842.
   The christening will take place shortly after the princess'
father, Prince Andrew, returns to Britain. A Royal Navy lieutenant,
he is serving on board the destroyer Edinburgh which has been in the
Far East.
   Princess Beatrice, born Aug. 8, is the first child of the prince,
the queen's second son, and the former Sarah Ferguson.
   Buckingham Palace said the royal couple chose Dr. John Habgood,
the archbishop of York and second-ranking prelate in the Church of
England, rather than the Archbishop of Canterbury, the church's
spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of ``personal
and appropriate'' reasons.
   The queen, as Princess Elizabeth of York, was also christened by
the then- archbishop of York but in the chapel at Buckingham Palace.

<LEADPARA>  Is she or isn't she the world's richest woman? And should she or shouldn't she
pay taxes on her income, just like everyone else? Those brash questions about
Queen Elizabeth II were raised in Parliament this week by Liberal Party Member
of Parliament Simon Hughes, in a move that reflected the opinion of a majority
of citizens.;    More than 70 percent of the British, polls show, believe her
income should be subject to taxes. Or as Hughes put it, "When so many people
in my (London) constituency are scraping along and asked to contribute tax on
very low incomes, it seems grossly unfair that the person with the highest
income escapes. And there's no reason a modern constitutional monarch
shouldn't pay taxes."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COUNTING QUEEN ELIZABETH'S MILLIONS
ESTIMATES PLACE MONARCH'S WEALTH AT $7.4
BILLION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The queen's personal net worth has long been a matter of considerable
speculation and argument, since, unlike U.S. heads of state, she is not
required to make public the amount of her wealth and she has not volunteered
the information. Estimates range on the high side -- Fortune magazine
estimates it at $7.4 billion, with an annual income of perhaps $3 million a
day; Buckingham Palace snorts that such a sum is "grossly exaggerated." There
also is a more modest estimate that her income is $35 million annually.;   
Over the years, researchers have tried to estimate the queen's personal
capital and income. Those assets are different from the institutions of the
monarchy, including the crown jewels in the Tower of London and the official
residences of Buckingham Castle, Windsor Castle, and Holyrood Castle.;    As
far as current official income goes, she receives from the British government
-- in what is called the Civil List -- 7.9 million pounds, or about $12.5
million. That sum is much more than her royal household expenses, giving her a
comfortable surplus this year. (Her employees, incidentally, pay taxes on
their salaries.);    But the queen has other major resources: Whatever money
she inherited from her father, King George VI; a vault full of precious jewels
-- crowns, tiaras, diamonds, rubies, emeralds; Faberge eggs; and the royal art
collection with 900 Leonardo Da Vinci drawings, 26 Van Dycks and works by
other masters. There is also one of the world's most valuable stamp
collections.;    Further, she owns hundreds of thousands of prime agricultural
acres, as well as valuable property in central London. Then there are Balmoral
and Sandringham castles with 64,000 acres between them. Not to be forgotten
are the royal stud farms and stables.;    The queen's major source of income
may be her private investments, which have accrued tax-free over a long
period. In 1971, to quiet speculation, the palace let it be known that her
investment portfolio in stock shares did not exceed 50 million pounds.;   
Taking an even lower figure of 35 million pounds, Andrew Morton, author of
"Theirs Is the Kingdom: The Wealth of the Windsors," consulted experts who
estimated that, if reasonably wisely invested, the portfolio would be worth
600 million pounds today. He estimates the queen's personal wealth at 1.2
billion pounds.  </TEXT>

   What do you do when the company you
founded is bought by foreigners for $310 million?
   If you're Mary Tyler Moore, you keep working. And you make some
charities very happy.
   Miss Moore said Wednesday the sale of MTM Entertainment Inc.,
the production company she co-founded, will free her to boost
contributions to the arts and to the fight against diabetes. A
diabetic, Miss Moore is international chairman of the Juvenile
Diabetes foundation.
   Just how much money does the 50-year-old actress get from the
sale of the company that bears her initials to Television South PLC
of Britain?
   ``Enough so I don't have to learn to type, after all,'' was all
she'd say.
   Sale or no, Miss Moore is set to appear in a new MTM series
slated to make its debut on CBS this fall, assuming the
scriptwriters strike is settled.
   The as-yet unnamed romantic comedy will feature Miss Moore as a
divorced mother working for a New York politician. In the series,
she marries a blue-collar worker from New Jersey with children of
his own.
   ``These children are going to be real children,'' she promised.
``They're not going to be cartoon characters. They're not going to
be little munchkins with quips.''

   Joan Kennedy, former wife of U.S. Sen.
Edward Kennedy, faces a hearing Aug. 5 on charges of drunken
driving, a court official says.
   Attorney Patrick Butler entered a plea of innocent on behalf of
Mrs. Kennedy in Barnstable District Court on Wednesday, said
Clerk-Magistrate Omer Chartrand. Mrs. Kennedy, 51, did not appear
in court.
   A hearing was scheduled for Aug. 5, Chartrand said.
   Centerville police arrested Mrs. Kennedy Tuesday night after she
drove into a chain-link fence along a road near the Cape Cod beach,
according to Lt. William Arthur.
   Mrs. Kennedy was not injured in the accident, he said. Police
towed and impounded the car.
   Mrs. Kennedy, who joined Alcoholics Anonymous, was divorced in
late 1983. She lives mostly in Boston.

   Lawyer Melvin Belli wants his Rumproast.
Not the dish, the dog.
   Belli, who is in the midst of a heated marital dispute, returned
to his mansion last weekend to collect some things. Little
Rumproast, also affectionately known as ``Rumpy,'' wasn't one of
them.
   His estranged wife, Lia, said he could pack up three of the
couple's pooches, but said their Italian greyhound was staying put.
   ``I just wanted to have a little watchdog here,'' she said,
adding that she let her husband take the other dogs because he
can't sleep without them.
   Belli said it's not fair. He said that because of concern about
``Rumpy's tears on being separated'' from the rest of his canine
family, he'll take legal steps to get the dog back.
   ``All I want is that the dog be with the other dogs; the dogs
hate her (Lia),'' he said. ``I slept with those dogs for the past
five or six years when I kicked her out of my bed.''
   Lia Belli filed for a legal separation last week.

   Oliver P. Morton, Indiana's first dog, may
be headed for stardom in New York after finding himself at the
center of a feud between talk show host David Letterman and Josie
Orr, the wife of Gov. Robert D. Orr.
   The Orrs' Welsh Corgi may be offered an appearance on the
``Stupid Pet Tricks'' segment of ``Late Night with David
Letterman'' as part of settling the feud, which the
Indianapolis-born comedian has mentioned on the air, said Becky
Weiland, an aide to Mrs. Orr.
   Letterman also is expected to call Mrs. Orr during his program
tonight or Friday.
   The feud began with an encounter with Letterman during the
Indianapolis 500 on May 29, the governor said Tuesday.
   ``Josie told him that Oliver P. Morton can push a rock around
the floor with his nose. But Letterman wasn't interested,'' Orr
said. ``He ignored her. Then he made some remark about, `How did
she get in here?' or something like that. That's the reason she's
upset with him.''

   Actress Ava Gardner, who suffered a mild
stroke two years ago, is contemplating a return to the silver
screen, her attorney says.
   ``She's fit as a fiddle, feels strong, feels great and is
thinking about doing a picture,'' lawyer Paul Caruso said Wednesday.
   The 66-year-old actress has ``recovered tremendously'' from the
stroke in late 1986, for which she was hospitalized for two months,
Caruso said.
   He did not say what kind of role Miss Gardner was considering.
   Miss Gardner, who has lived in London for the past 20 years, was
the daughter of a poor North Carolina tenant farmer. She became a
leading lady in the 1940s and 1950s.
   She starred in 60 films, including ``The Snows of Kilimanjaro,''
``The Barefoot Contessa'' and ``The Killers.'' She most recently
was seen in the CBS-TV series ``Falcon Crest.''

presented new colors, or regimental flags, to the regiment
Wednesday at the Garrison Grounds, a grassy field behind the
downtown Halifax Citadel, a historic British fortress.
   Margaret's eight-day tour of Canada was prompted by a request 18

Harrods, London's luxury department store, today presented a new toothpaste for 
dogs that fights tooth decay and promises to give pets fresh breath. 
</P>
<P>
"Britain has nearly 7 million dogs, and their life expectancy is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
But often they have decaying teeth and gums, and their breath smells foul 
because they are fed on dog food that is soft," said Dr. Roger Mugford, an 
animal behaviorist.

Mugford told reporters at the presentation of the new Petrodex toothpaste that 
he had tried the product out himself on a long-haired Irish setter and a

   Have you ever bought English tea thinking that the
royal seal on the package means Queen Elizabeth II drinks it?
   Brace yourself for a disappointment if you did. The warrant
doesn't guarantee that she does. Actually, Buckingham Palace won't
say what Her Majesty prefers.
   ``Does that matter?'' asks Hugh Faulkner, secretary of the Royal
Warrant Holders Association. ``The fact that she might not drink it
is irrelevant. That tea goes into Buckingham Palace.''
   Nevertheless, the Economist magazine wrote recently, ``Such
labels could mislead the unwary for two reasons'' _ a warrant
holder can display the royal insignia on goods other than just
those it supplies to a palace, and warrants also go to companies
supplying palace staff but not the royals themselves.
   Warrants are dispensed by the queen, the queen mother, Prince
Philip or Prince Charles. The warrants entitle holders to put a
royal coat of arms on labels, letterheads, trucks and buildings,
along with the words ``by appointment'' to whichever royal has
given the warrant.
   The wording changes with the monarch.
   Royal Worcester, the maker of fine china, got its warrant from
King George III 200 years ago, and today is ``by appointment to
Queen Elizabeth II.''
   Other countries' surviving monarchs also grant warrants, and in
Britain the practice is centuries old.
   To win a warrant in Britain, a tradesman must have supplied the
royal household regularly for three years, and gotten paid by the
royal family for his goods or services, Buckingham Palace says.
   Various holders have more than one warrant, but only about a
dozen elite, including Harrod's department store, hold all four.
   Others, like Royal Worcester, take pride in the length of their
service to the queen, who grants the most warrants of the four
entitled to.
   The queen's list is studded with luxury goods makers, including
12 jewelers and eight champagne sellers. There also are bagpipe
makers, military outfitters, suppliers of venison, chimney sweeps,
shipping agents, clock makers, porcelain restorers, purveyors of
potted shrimp and sloe gin, suppliers of gold and silver lace,
insignia and embroidery, and a heraldic artist.
   There's even a seller of mopeds on the list.
   More practical are suppliers who sell eggs and plastic bags and
``installers of intruder alarms,'' something all the more necessary
since July 1982, when a London eccentric broke into the queen's
bedroom and woke her up.
   The lists do keep up with the times. They contain, for example,
more computer equipment makers than in the past.
   About 10 to 40 warrants are granted a year. They cost nothing.
   A Royal Household Tradesmen's Warrants Committee decides once a
year who should get a warrant from the queen or her son and heir,
Prince Charles, subject to royal approval, and announce the results
in the London Gazette, the government bulletin. Queen Mother
Elizabeth and Prince Philip consider applications throughout the
year.
   In olden times the granting of warrants was a more personal
affair. According to Royal Worcester, it got its warrant from
George III after he happened by the porcelain works and was
enchanted with the china.
   The products don't have to be British, but most are.
   ``There are very few outsiders,'' Faulkner said.
   British subsidiaries of foreign companies have won warrants,
including American ones, like Kellogg, IBM, Heinz, and the makers
of Johnson's wax.
   When companies lose their warrants _ because they aren't
measuring up, change hands, or the palace's needs have changed _
they are simply omitted from the published list.
   No official reason is given, and no figures are available
showing how many have been dropped.
   But, Faulkner said, ``people ... will notice.''
   Does a warrant help sales?
   ``Yes, it does,'' said a Royal Worcester spokesman.
   ``As you're aware, in this country the royal family is very
important. People do take note of it.''
   Cadbury Schweppes says it displays royal arms on chocolate bars
sold overseas.
   Faulkner said: ``Particularly in the Japanese market and
certainly in the American market, it doesn't hurt.''
   On the question of the queen's tea, Faulkner said: ``I wouldn't
make too much play of that particular angle. The lovely thing about
this is that people's imaginations can run wild. You don't want to
disappoint them.''
   Besides, he said, it's not something you'd bring up with the
queen.
   ``I think it would really be wrong, it would be bloody bad
manners to inquire ... what her personal likes and dislikes might
be.''

   The woman who brought a queen's comfort to the
bomb-shattered East End during World War II returned to the rebuilt
district Wednesday to celebrate her 90th birthday.
   Nearly 50 years after the German blitz, the presence of Queen
Elizabeth the Queen Mother rekindled warm memories of a bitter time.
   During the war years, the then-Queen Elizabeth picked her way
through the rubble in high heels and the pastel dresses she still
favors today, offering words of ecouragement to East Enders. They
still remember.
   ``She really did cheer us up. People were down in their depths
at the time,'' said Myrtle Lester, who as an 11-year-old spent long
hours in a damp backyard bomb shelter.
   The visit to the East End was a sentimental high point in four
months of parades and pageants leading up to the birthday on
Saturday of the ``Queen Mum,'' as she is fondly known.
   She arrived in the riverside district aboard the royal yacht
Britannia, wearing a light blue dress and matching hat with a wispy
veil, a string of pearls and a beaming smile.
   Elderly East Enders mingled with youngsters waving Union Jacks
who turned out to greet her. Alice Poyser, 69, said she remembered
well the wartime visits of the queen and King George VI.
   ``We were pleased to see her. It felt like a mother talking to
us,'' she said. Mrs. Poyser said her family was bombed out of three
successive homes.
   Several people in the crowd recalled the queen's words after
Buckingham Palace was hit by a bomb: ``I'm glad we've been bombed.
It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.''
   During the war, Prime Minister Winston Churchill advised her to
go to Canada for safety. She ignored him, and took lessons at
Buckingham Palace on how to use a rifle.
   Her daughters _ Elizabeth, now the queen, and Princess Margaret
_ stayed at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London, during the
conflict.
   The East End's shattered docks and factories have been replaced
by a huge redevelopment project that has brought new homes, shops
and offices.
   The Queen Mother unveiled a plaque honoring 76 people killed by
a bomb and revisited the shelters underneath All Saints' Church,
itself a bombing casualty in 1945. She also saw some of those she
met during wartime.
   Wednesday night, she was to be guest of honor at a birthday
dinner on the Britannia given by the queen and Prince Philip,
followed by fireworks over the Tower of London.
   The Queen Mother was born Aug. 4, 1900. Lady Elizabeth Angela
Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the ninth child of the Earl and Countess
of Strathmore, whose family home was Glamis Castle in Scotland.
   In 1923 she married the Duke of York, second of four surviving
sons of King George V.
   She became queen, quite unexpectedly, when the duke's elder
brother, Edward, abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee
Wallis Warfield Simpson.
   Biographers say the Queen Mother never recovered from her
husband's early death from lung cancer in 1952. She still refers to
him as ``the king'' and declines public appearances on the
anniversaries of his birth, marriage and death.
   Despite her age, the Queen Mother is still one of the most
active royals. Only the queen and Princess Anne make more public
appearances.

From Leicester via a national tour and the Royal Court, Sue Townsend's
comedy has passed to the West End. As you must know, both the play and the
original 'novel' are about the present royal family, imagined as reduced by
a newly republican Britain to a grim council estate in Leicester. And why
not?
Ms Townsend chooses, however, not to explore many questions. I do not mean
that she ought to have explored any of them; only that her leaving them
untouched (why has the republic treated the royals so brutally? do they
learn anything significant in their exile? do their neighbours?) restricts
her play to a simple, homely vein in a never-never land.
The time of its notional future must be just weeks away, since the royals we
meet here have done nothing newly ridiculous since the ludicrous things we
think we know about already. Though there are mischievous little sallies
about those, none is followed up, and no character develops. For the guiding
premise is only this: wouldn't it be funny if the Queen and her clan were
stuck in a council estate?
Here I should declare a disability, from birth. All Brits, one gathers,
sometimes dream about meeting the Queen (often in unlikely circumstances,
but most often over tea) - even hard-Left Brits. That suggests that she
occupies a special place in your national dream-world, somewhere far beyond
ordinary assessment. When Ms Townsend brings her on to the stage in the
Celia Johnson-ish persona of Paula Wilcox, she comes ready-made as an icon;
you can then be titillated by hints of lese-majeste, and reminders of recent
'misconduct', and by the royals' supposed incomprehension of council-estate
demotic.
Those account for nearly all the comic substance of The Queen and I; those,
and a steady dribble of knowing references. For example, Prince Philip
insists on having his tea 'in my World Wildlife Fund mug]' Ha ha. Later the
Queen remarks that she has 'never met a butcher - except Bomber Harris, of
course.' Ha ha. But I liked the stuffed but lively corgi and the baby, both
in Spitting Image style.
Thanks to television, we expect stage-royal figures to be good
impersonators. Miss Wilcox makes a shy, engaging Queen, with glints of
something shyly aggressive. There is crepitating charm from Gillian Hanna's
Queen Mum (and Crawfie); David Horovitch's Philip is a testy but kindly soul
out of sit-com, and Toby Salaman's Charles a sympathetic, full-blooded
impersonation. Lizzy McInnerney's Di looks good, though the accent is more
striving-toward-Sloane-from-below than upper-class drooping Sloanewards;
Carole Hayman's Margaret is a creature from Noel Coward's stage milieu.
Pearce Quigley is outstandingly gormless as Prince William, two other chaps
and a Mrs Newman.
Their caricatured speech betrays scarcely any common ground, so we get no
sense of an aristocracy collectively at bay in an unfamiliar real world. In
Ms Townsend's 'novels', there is something steady and unwinking behind their
cute prose surfaces. Here, that is dissipated among all the actors' turns
and the continual one-joke vignettes. But the amiability-factor is pretty
high; and if you can top it up with your own monarchical kink, you should
enjoy the show.

<HEAD>Government Acts to End Annual Row Over Royal Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attempt to end yearly budget-time rows over
the royal allowance, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Tuesday
the royal family will receive a fixed annual increase for the next
decade.
   Such an arrangement was used for about 200 years before 1975.
Then, the government began granting the royal allotment on an
annual basis as part of the national budget.
   The Civil List, as the payment is known, will rise at about 7.5
percent per year for the next decade, Mrs. Thatcher said.
   She said the royal family is ``a focus of patriotism, loyalty,
affection and esteem. It is a rare combination and we should value
it.''
   Behind her move was the wish to avoid the annual budget-day
``pay rise'' announcement, which both politicians and the royal
family found unseemly. Anti-monarchists used the budget
announcement as a chance to attack the expense of maintaining the
royals.
   Under the 1990 budget, the royal allowance totalled about $12.1
million. Queen Elizabeth II received the lion's share at $9.26
million.
   The Civil List officially repays the monarch and 10 other
members of her family for official duties. About 70 percent of the
money goes to salaries and employment costs for royal staff.
   The queen has 250 permanent full-time employees, including those
in her private office, the Buckingham Palace press office staff and
those responsible for ceremonial duties.
   Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, is not on the Civil
List. He receives undisclosed income from royal estates.
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock applauded the new
arrangement and said it would ``provide for greater continuity and
more effective planning in the financing of the royal household.''
   Meanwhile, the queen has recruited a leading London accountant
to help run her households more efficiently.
   Michael Peat, 40, a partner in the accounting firm of Peat
Marwick McLintock, was named the royal household's director of
finance and property services. He will oversee the management of
Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, St. James Palace and Kensington
Palace.

<HEAD>Princess Anne Denies Reports She's to Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Princess Anne, separated from her husband since
August, on Monday denied reports in British newspapers that she is
to divorce Capt. Mark Phillips.
   ``Divorce? It's not been mentioned,'' Queen Elizabeth II's only
daughter told reporters outside her Gatcombe Park home, British
Broadcasting Corp. television reported.
   Buckingham Palace refused to comment on the Monday reports in
the Daily Express, Daily Mail and Daily Mirror newspapers.
   Anne, 39, and Phillips, 41, separated last August after 15 years
of marriage. They have two children.
   A spokesman at Buckingham Palace, who was not identified in
keeping with British custom, said: ``I have nothing to add to what
was said at the time of the separation.''
   The palace issued a statement on Aug. 31 that said: ``Her Royal
Highness, the Princess Royal, and Captain Mark Phillips have
decided to separate on terms agreed between them. There are no
plans for divorce proceedings.''
   At the time, royal sources said the queen was ``obviously
saddened'' but understood the couple's decision.
   Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth II's younger sister, was
divorced from her husband, Lord Snowdon, in 1978.

<TEXT>
   The Duchess of York gave birth to a 7-pound,
1{-ounce daughter by Caesarean section Friday night, and mother and
child are both well, Portland Hospital announced.
   It was the second child and second girl for the 30-year-old
duchess and her husband Prince Andrew, and is the sixth grandchild
of Queen Elizabeth II.
   The new baby, daughter of the queen's second son, is sixth in
line to the British throne after her sister, Princess Beatrice of
York, who was born Aug. 8, 1988.
   Andrew was present at the delivery at 7:58 p.m. (2:58 p.m. EST),
the hospital statement said.
   The Caesarean section was carried out because the baby was in a
breech position, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. ``It was the
wrong way round,'' he said.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, had spent the last week
at Buckingham Palace in London instead of her country home. She
arrived at the London hospital nearly four hours earlier in a
chauffeur-driven car and entered through a side entrance, avoiding
photographers waiting at the front.
   Her husband joined her two hours later after driving the 150
miles from Devonport naval dockyard, where he is based as a flight
commander on the Royal Navy frigate Campbeltown.
   As tradition dictates, a notice was posted on the railings at
Buckingham Palace giving news of the birth.
   It read: ``Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York was safely
delivered of a daughter at 7:58 p.m. today. Her Royal Highness and
her child are well.''
   The birth was greeted by cheering and the cracking of champagne
corks by a small crowd of well-wishers outside the hospital.
   The Duchess of York's father, Maj. Ronald Ferguson, said at his
home at Dummer, a village 53 miles southwest of London: ``I am
delighted for the mother and daughter.''
   For Beatrice's birth, the duchess was admitted shortly after 10
a.m. and gave birth at 8:18 p.m.
   No name was announced immediately for the new baby, but she will
be known as Her Royal Highness, Princess (baby's name) of York.
   Andrew's elder brother Prince Charles, 41, is first in line to
the throne, followed by his sons Prince William and Prince Harry of
Wales. Then comes Andrew, 30, then Beatrice.
   The queen's unmarried youngest son, Edward, 26, is now seventh
in line of succession. Her 39-year-old daughter Anne, the Princess
Royal, is eighth and has a son and daughter, Peter and Zara, who
are ninth and tenth.
   The duke's ship has returned to Britain after exercises and is
to remain in home waters until July. The queen went to Windsor
Castle, 21 miles west of London, for the weekend and has been
notified of the birth.

   Fresh from the splendors of the Kremlin, President
Reagan and his wife Nancy went to Buckingham Palace for tea with
the queen Thursday and smiled aside all invitations to compare the
virtues of East and West.
   Standing on a red carpet in the marble-columned Grand Entrance
Hall of the 600-room palace, the president was asked by a reporter
whether he was happy to be out of Moscow and back in London.
   ``Let me put it very simply, I'm very happy to be in London,''
he replied, smiling wryly.
   Mrs. Reagan, whose prickly relationship with Raisa Gorbachev was
evident during this week's Moscow summit, was asked whether she was
happy to be seeing Queen Elizabeth II rather than the Soviet
leader's wife.
   ``I'm very happy to see the queen at all times,'' she replied
with a big smile.
   The hour-long tea in the queen's Audience Room overlooking the
45-acre palace gardens was a meeting of old friends. The Reagans
were guests of the royal family at Windsor Castle in 1982, and the
62-year-old monarch stayed at the Reagan ranch in 1983. Reagan
attended a Buckingham Palace dinner during the 1984 economic summit.
   The Reagans arrived at the palace two minutes late, getting out
of their limousine at the glassed-in Grand Entrance, where Prince
Charles and Princess Diana returned in a horse-drawn open carriage
after their 1981 wedding extravaganza.
   Inside the hall, the queen, hatless and wearing a sapphire-blue
silk dress, stretched out her hand and said: ``Nice to see you
again. How are you Mr. President?''
   Reagan, in a blue suit and red and blue striped tie, and the
first lady, wearing a silk two-piece dress and matching shoes in
her favorite color of red, chatted with the queen while posing for
photographers.
   Then, the queen led them along the gilt-and-white Marble Hall,
lined with sculptures and paintings mainly of her great-great
grandmother Queen Victoria, to the Audience Room, where she
receives Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for her weekly audience.
   It was just tea for three, since the queen's husband, Prince
Philip, had a previous engagement in Suffolk.
   The Reagans' greeting was watched by about 50 members of the
queen's household who stood behind a red rope in the Marble Hall.
   Outside the palace, police said about 1,500 people gathered,
cheering and waving as the Reagans drove by. The president and his
wife waved back as they swept through the iron gates.
   ``We got a beautiful warm smile. It was worth the 2{-hour
wait,'' said Barbara Lee of Minneapolis, Minnesota.
   Barbara Black of Camarillo, California, said: ``I live ... about
30 miles from Reagan's ranch, and I don't bother to visit him, and
here I am half way around the world standing in line waiting to get
a vague glimpse of him.''
   Justine Griffin, a Scot who waited outside the palace, also was
enthusiastic about the American president.
   ``I think he's a good bloke,'' she said.
   After tea, the Reagans went their separate ways.
   The president went to the Foreign Office where he was officially
welcomed by Mrs. Thatcher and a band of Welsh Guards playing the
national anthem and Irving Berlin hits.
   The first lady returned to the U.S. ambassador's residence,
Winfield House, to meet with Prince Charles, who flew back to
London from a series of public engagements in Lancashire.
   Mrs. Reagan and the 39-year-old heir to the throne have met
several times previously in Washington and London, and the palace
said they share an interest in social and human rights issues.

Still on the subject of presents, the lull in new product launches in
Britain's royal memorabilia market seems to have ended. One company, no
doubt staffed by republicans, has produced a 'Windsor in Flames'
commemorative mug. On one side is a picture of a burning Windsor castle,
while the other has a cartoon of a monarch, plus corgis, living in a
cardboard box on the Embankment and saying 'Can you spare us Pounds 60m,
guv?'
Rather surprisingly, the Guardian carried the advert but Time Out, the
London listings magazine, rejected it. Bet that wouldn't have happened when
it was being run by the previous bunch of lefties.

TRANSIT OF VENUS: TRAVELS IN THESOUTH PACIFIC by Julian Evans Secker &amp;
Warburg Pounds 16.99, 277 pages
PILGRIM OF THE VOID by Kenneth White Mainstream Pounds 14.99, 254 pages
PRE-publication hype is getting more and more serious. Nowadays, books have
to be garlanded with pre-pub quotes. You know the sort: 'The best book on
Corgi breeding I have ever read' - Queen Elizabeth II; 'A wonderful
introduction to developing your personality. Invaluable bedtime reading' -
John Major.
The pre-pub quote that accompanies Transit of Venus is from Norman Lewis, no
less. Lewis is in the premier division of travel writers. 'Transit of Venus
is the best book about the South Seas I have ever read. Julian Evans is the
Robert Louis Stevenson of the post-nuclear Pacific,' he says.
Post-nuclear Pacific? Robert Louis Stevenson? Mid-way through the book, I
thought that Lewis had flipped; by the end, I was happily changing my mind,
for Julian Evans builds his story well and is a meticulous, vivid writer -
reminiscent of Lewis himself.
Evans starts in Sydney. He goes to New Caledonia, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga,
Tuvalu, Kiribati and finally the Marshall Islands, including the military
base at Kwajalein and the island ghetto of Kili. By the time he reaches the
Marshalls he is close to despair, and little wonder. In the Marshalls,
everyone sleeps with everyone, gets syphilis, gets treated, sleeps with
everyone else again.
The Marshallese, says Evans, do not see the point of contraception, so the
president had imported 15m tonnes of California's domestic garbage to create
lagoon landfills - 'a brilliantly simple scheme in which the government
would be paid Dollars 140m by grateful waste disposal companies and
potentially end up doubling the land area of Majuro island . . . in 10 years
time he would be able to say he was president of the biggest garbage dump in
the Pacific.' This is a bleak book. Robert Louis Stevenson or not, Evans is
honest and shrewd: a first-rate reporter.
Pilgrim of the Void is not an easy read, but perhaps the fault is mine.
Kenneth White, says his publisher, was born in Glasgow, settled in France in
1967 and holds the chair of 20th century poetics at the Sorbonne. He has won
prizes, and is an expert on post-modernity, but can't be all bad.
Pilgrim of the Void starts in Hong Kong, moves to Macao and Taiwan, then
Thailand and Japan. Here is a typical passage (the author is taking a train
from Kowloon to Shatin, to visit the 10,000 Buddha Temples): 'There was a
little beauty in the carriage, one of these beauties that grace South China,
only 16 years old, the kind of girl described in the beautiful Cantonese
phrase ham bao doi fong (flower blossom waiting open). Ah yes, lovely,
perfect loveliness - ni ho lei, little girl, ni ho lei, ni ho lei], shall I
say it a hundred times under my breath, like a prayer?' Either this is a
reasonably good travel book, or else a load of tosh. I expect I read it too
quickly. I will now read it slowly.

<HEAD>Queen Elizabeth Gives Preview of Christmas Message</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II, in a preview of her annual
Christmas message, spoke optimistically of Eastern and Western
Europe living as neighbors and an unselfish world uniting to save
the planet.
   The queen broke the tradition of keeping her message secret
until Christmas day and delivered part of it to an audience of
6,000 at London's Royal Albert Hall on Tuesday night.
   Buckingham Palace confirmed Wednesday that sections of her
speech would be included in her Christmas message to the 49-nation
Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies.
   The monarch, speaking on the ``exciting'' political and social
changes in recent months, said people in both Eastern and Western
Europe have been able to think about themselves more as neighbors.
And the key to the future was learning to ``love thy neighbor as
thyself,'' she said.
   The possibility that Christ's message might at last be heeded
could make the 1990s a time for peace and cooperation to preserve
the planet from environmental threats, she said.
   ``If we can reduce dishonesty, selfishness and injustice, the
'90s might become years of peace and tranquillity, and a time to
work together for the benefit of our planet as a whole,'' the queen
said.
   ``We must be kind to it for the sake of our children and our
children's children,'' she said.
   The queen was attending a Christmas fund-raising gala for the
Save The Children charity, headed by her daughter, Princess Anne.
   ``I usually make my Christmas broadcast to the Commonwealth from
Windsor or Buckingham Palace,'' she said. ``This year I thought I
would use the presence of 2,000 children in the Royal Albert Hall
to send this special message to the children of the Commonwealth.''
   Among the children at the gala, where a cast of 700 told the
story of the Bible from creation to the birth of Christ, were two
of the queen's grandsons: Peter Philips, 12, who is Anne's son, and
Prince William, 7, son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana.

<TEXT>
   Princess Beatrice was bapitized Tuesday by the
archbishop of York with water from the Jordan River, and she let out
just one quick cry as her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York,
watched in delight.
   The 19-week-old princess, the newest member of Britain's royal
family, got a calming pat on the back from her mother after the
archbishop poured the water on her forehead in a ceremony that made
her a member of the Church of England.
   Queen Elizabeth II, the baby's grandmother who is temporal head
of the Anglican church, smiled broadly as she led the baby and about
100 relatives and friends out of the Chapel Royal at St. James'
Palace after the christening to pose briefly for photographers.
   The blue-eyed princess, who has her mother's red hair, looked
directly into the cameras. She didn't let out a peep as she rested
in the arms of the duchess, who wore an emerald green suit and
matching hat with a wide upturned brim and black band.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the queen's fifth grandchild, was born on Aug. 8, 1988, at 8:18
p.m., considered to be lucky by Chinese astrologers.
   Poet Laureate Ted Hughes wrote what he called a nursey-rhyme hymn
woven around the six eights in her birth. It notes that the
``blessed and fortunate'' child comes into a world of ``poisoned
glut'' and ``poisoned seas.''
   The princess' baptism was delayed until after her father, Prince
Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, returned last week from a tour of
duty in the Far East.
   Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess chose the Most Rev.
John Habgood, Archbishop of York and second-ranking prelate in the
church rather than Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the
church's spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of
``personal and appropriate'' reasons _ a reference to their York
title.
   The Chapel Royal, the main surviving part of the Tudor Palace
built by Henry VIII, was also chosen by the couple, the palace said.
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were married in the chapel in 1840
and royal christenings occasionally have taken place there.
   The 30-minute private ceremony included three hymns chosen by the
parents, ``Jesus, Good Above All Other,'' ``All Things Bright and
Beautiful,'' and a Christmas touch, ``Away In A Manger.''
   The choir also sang ``Princess Beatrice's Anthem,'' composed by
Richard Popplewell, organist and choir master of the queen's Chapels
Royal, with words by the late Lord Gorell, a literary magazine
editor.
   Beatrice was dressed in the royal family's christening robe of
flowing cream Honiton lace, first worn by Queen Victoria's eldest
son in 1842.
   She was baptized at the silver gilt Lily Font, made for the
christening in 1840 of Princess Victoria, Queen Victoria's eldest
child, and used to baptize Queen Elizabeth's four children.
   Like all godparents at Anglican baptisms, Beatrice's five were
reminded of their duty to raise the princess to fight against evil
and to follow Christ.
   Her godparents are Viscount Linley, son of the queen's sister
Princess Margaret; property developer Peter Palumbo, who is chairman
of the Arts Council; Mrs. Harry Cotterell, who formerly shared an
apartment with the duchess; the Duchess of Roxburghe, at whose
Scottish home the duke proposed to the then-Sarah Ferguson; and Mrs.
John Greenall, a friend of the duchess.
   Among the guests at the christening were the queen's eldest son
and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, his wife, Princess Diana and
their two children, Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4. Queen
Mother Elizabeth, the baby's 88-year-old great-grandmother, was also
there.
   After the ceremony, the guests went to Buckingham Palace for a
tea party in the white and gold decorated Bow Room overlooking the
palace gardens. The duke, an accomplished amateur photographer, took
the official family photographs of the christening party.

   More than 800 guests attended a glittering ball
held by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday night
toate the 90th birthday of her mother this year and three
other royal anniversaries in 1990.
   The ball marked the 90th birthday of Elizabeth the Queen Mother
on Aug. 4, the 60th birthday of the queen's sister Princess
Margaret on Aug. 21, the 40th birthday of the queen's daughter
Princess Anne on Aug. 15 and the 30th birthday of the queen's
second son Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, on Feb. 19.
   Guests at what the palace called ``the dance of the decades''
included personal friends of the royals from the arts, politics and
high society and scores of other celebrities and dignitaries.
   The palace in a brief statement described it as a private
function as opposed to a formal state occasion. Almost every member
of the royal family was present to welcome the guests.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association described it
as the biggest party at the palace since the one in November 1988
marking the 40th birthday of Prince Charles, the queen's eldest son
and heir to the throne.
   Guests held dinner parties at top restaurants throughout
London's West End before driving to the palace for the ball, which
began shortly after 10 p.m.
   Because of the large number of guests, the palace picture
gallery with its valuable collection of Old Master paintings was
transformed into a ballroom.
   Its gilded ceiling was hung with blue draperies and the gallery
was lit by a starry constellation of white lights. Drawing rooms
and and the music room leading from the gallery were filled with
huge arrangements of flowers.
   Guests included songwriter Tim Rice; singer Cleo Laine; Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, the father of Prince Andrew's wife the Duchess of
York, formerly Sarah Ferguson; Mark Thatcher, son of former Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Thatcher's American wife Diane.

   Royal aide Timothy Laurence, whose letters to
Princess Anne have renewed speculation her marriage is in trouble,
was dropped from Queen Elizabeth II's entourage at the public
premiere of a new London musical.
   But Buckingham Palace stressed in a statement that Laurence had
remained on duty back at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London.
   The bachelor, a Royal Navy commander, had been scheduled to
accompany the queen, Anne's mother, to a charity performance Monday
night of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's new show, ``Aspects of
Love,'' in London's West End.
   As Scotland Yard investigated the theft of four of Laurence's
letters to Anne from the palace, speculation about her 15-year
marriage to Mark Phillips made front-page news again today in
London's royal-mad tabloids.
   Phillips, a farmer and equestrian, is a former captain in The
Queen's Dragoon Guards. Rumors his marriage to Anne is in trouble
have circulated for years and recently the two have spent up to six
months a year apart.
   They have two children, Peter, 11, and Zara, 7.
   ``Dashing queen's equerry (aide) Tim Laurence is `besotted' with
Princess Anne and believes she loves him too,'' The Sun, Britain's
largest circulation newspaper, reported today, quoting unnamed
friends of Laurence.
   ``The handsome 34-year-old Naval Commander often speaks to her
on the phone late at night, sometimes for more than an hour. And he
meets her secretly whenever possible in London or at country
homes.''
   Anne's father-in-law, Maj. Peter Phillips, denied Monday that
the marriage was on the rocks, and said he spoke to his son as
recently as Sunday.
   ``He would confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the
conversation was about horses,'' Phillips said.
   ``It's not the sort of marriage that ordinary people would
understand at all _ they spend so much time away from one another.
   ``If people are royal, they don't necessarily spend lots of time
together ... Of course their marriage is very unusual.''
   The British domestic news agency Press Association said Anne,
38, and her 40-year-old husband were reunited for six hours
overnight at their country mansion, Gatcombe Park, 90 miles west of
London, after she spent a busy day fulfilling engagements in
northwest England.
   The news agency said Anne arrived home after midnight but left
about 6 a.m. to go horseback riding. When she returned three hours
later to prepare for engagements in London, Phillips had left the
house. His business agent, Taryn Bennelick, said today he was
somewhere in Spain but gave no details.
   Anne has become the busiest and one of the most admired member
of Britain's royal family. As president of the Save the Children
Fund charity, she travels on behalf of children in poverty-stricken
and war-torn Third World countries. Phillips also travels widely on
various business and equestrian interests.
   The latest speculation about the couple's marriage began after
The Sun reported Thursday that it had been sent anonymously four
letters stolen from Anne's desk at Buckingham Palace.
   The Sun pledged not to publish the contents and said it had
turned them over to Scotland Yard.
   After a Sunday newspaper told Buckingham Palace it was going to
name the author, the palace identified Laurence.
   Royalty correspondent Richard Kay wrote today in The Daily Mail
``Anne and Mark no longer have a marriage in the conventional
sense.''
   But Kay predicted: ``There won't be any announcement of a
divorce ... For it is she... who has brought back much
respectability to the royal family at a time when popularity and
support are on the wane... Certainly the old guard at the palace
would be appalled at the thought of another divorce within the
royal family.''
   Princess Margaret, Anne's aunt and the queen's only sister, was
divorced in 1978 from Lord Snowdon, who has since remarried.

   Prince William, 7-year-old son of heir-to-the
throne Prince Charles, will go to boarding school next year,
Buckingham Palace said.
   William is to attend Ludgrove School in Berkshire county, 10
miles from the Windsor Castle country home of his grandmother,
Queen Elizabeth II, and 35 miles from his parents' London home at
Kensington Palace.
   William, who will be 8 by the time he starts at Ludgrove, has
been attending Wetherby School in London.
   The choice of the 186-student school is a break with family
tradition. Charles attended Cheam Preparatory School, as did his
father, Prince Philip.
   Buckingham Palace announced Friday that Ludgrove had been the
``joint parental choice'' of Charles and his wife, Diana.
   Another royal offspring, 15-month-old Princess Beatrice, took
her first trip abroad, Buckingham Palace announced Saturday.
   Her mother, Sarah, the Duchess of York, slipped quietly out of
the country for a private vacation in Australia with her elder
sister, Jane. The Duke of York, Prince Andrew, is taking a
refresher course in England as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot.

   Actor and animal lover Ed Asner gave a sendoff
to about 190 people with dogs before a three-mile walk to raise
money for a program that puts dogs into nursing homes as therapy
for the elderly and disabled.
   Asner, who is appearing in a production of ``Born Yesterday'' at
the Mechanic Theatre, last week visited the Keswick Home with
Sterling the cat, a regular ambassador for Pets On Wheels.
   ``I can imagine the joy you bring into the hearts and minds of
people in hospitals,'' Asner, who sported a T-shirt and kerchief
with the Pets on Wheels logo, said Sunday. ``Pets are the
four-legged flowers of our lives.''
   He was declared an honorary volunteer and presented with gifts,
including a small bag of food for his two cats back in California.
   ``It's true that actors on the road do get hungry now and
then,'' Asner joked, eyeing the bag.
   The event raised $13,500 in pledges and donations.

   The Duchess of York will extend her Australian
visit by two weeks so she can spend more time with her husband,
Prince Andrew, who is on Royal Navy duty there, Buckingham Palace
said Monday.
   The couple's 10-week-old daughter, Princess Beatrice, will
remain in England with her nanny.
   ``The duchess will be remaining in Australia for the duration of
the Royal Navy Task Group deployment,'' the palace said in a
statement.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, left Britain on Sept. 21
for a 10-day official tour to help celebrate Australia's
bicentennial.
   When the tour ended Oct. 7, she spent several days visiting her
sister, Jane Makin, who lives in Australia. She then flew to
Tasmania to join Andrew, a lieutenant on the destroyer Edinburgh,
when it docked in the state capital of Hobart.
   Andrew, second oldest son of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, is
earning his watchkeeping and ocean navigation certificates.

   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy was honored for his work to
help gain the release of Soviet refuseniks.
   Action for Soviet Jewry presented Kennedy, D-Mass., with its
Freedom Award for lobbying the Kremlin on behalf of such Soviet
emigrees as Benjamin Charny and Yuri Zieman.
   The senator told an awards banquet Sunday he is encouraged by
the recent emigration of Soviet Jews, but is cautious about
indications that several stumbling blocks to emigration may soon be
dropped.
   ``There is some reason to hope that the Soviets will finally
open the gates of emigration and end the harsh persecution of their
Jewish citizens,'' Kennedy said in prepared remarks.
   ``But nothing is certain, and as long as teachers of Hebrew are
arrested, as long as books of Jewish learning are confiscated, as
long as innocent human beings are persecuted because of their
belief in the God of their fathers, none of us can be silent or
uninvolved.''

   Queen Elizabeth arrived Monday on the
first-ever visit of a reigning British monarch to Spain with just
one obstacle clouding the horizon: the Rock of Gibraltar.
   The Queen was met at the airport by two relatives, Crown Prince
Felipe and Princess Elena, and drove with them and the Duke of
Edinburgh through streets decked with red and yellow Spanish flags
and red, blue and white Union Jacks to El Pardo Palace, the
residence for state guests, on the outskirts of Madrid.
   There she was received with full military honors by her third
cousin, King Juan Carlos, Queen Sofia and members of the government
of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   The five-day tour, which includes trips to Seville and Barcelona
and two private days on the Mediterranean island of Majorca, is
being hailed by the Spanish press as the final step in the
normalization of relations between the two countries that began
with Juan Carlos' visit to Britain in April 1986 and has been
coaxed along by members of Europe's two most important royal
families.
   The 62-year-old British monarch and the 50-year-old Spanish king
are third cousins through Britain's Queen Victoria.
   Press and radio commentators have noted that Britain is the only
country in the world with which Spain still maintains a major
dispute _ sovereignty over Gibraltar.
   The Rock was ceded to Britain by treaty in 1713 when Spain lost
the War of Spanish Succession.
   The Queen and Juan Carlos were expected to talk about Gibraltar,
but ``this will not be a political discussion, of course,'' said a
British source who asked to remain anonymous.

From the fog of London to the glitter of Hollywood to the sands of the Sahara, 
there are no boundaries for Sissy Harrington-McGill and her holistic pet food. 
Whether it's royalty's horses, a celebrity's chow chow or a sheik's camel, when 
pampered pets get hungry, their concerned owners look to El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
What started out as a small dog food business in 1974 out of 
Harrington-McGill's La Mesa home has now turned into a multipurpose pet product 
center -- Solid Gold Animal Nutrition Center at 1483 Cuyamaca St. 
</P>
<P>
So what makes the Queen of England and so many other celebrities go for the 
Gold? The answer is in the food's ingredients, some of which are said to be 
unique to the pet world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stumbled Upon Business 
</P>
<P>
According to Harrington-McGill, her introduction to the pet products field came 
by accident while searching overseas for Great Danes. 
</P>
<P>
"I bred Great Danes as a hobby," Harrington-McGill said. "After losing three of 
them to bloat, I decided to go to Germany to buy another. I visited 44 kennels 
until I found the dog I was looking for. In fact, I bought two of them." 
</P>
<P>
While there, she asked the owner of the kennel, Baron Hans-Georg von Maischack, 
if he knew what caused bloat. To her surprise, he said he had never heard of 
the canine ailment because it doesn't exist in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Bloat, according to Dean Gahring, president of the San Diego County Veterinary 
Assn., kills about 500 dogs a week in the United States. The specific cause is 
unknown, he said, but it's mainly because of gastric torsion -- where the 
stomach twists from 90 to 100 degrees or more, causing the juncture between the 
stomach and the esophagus, and the stomach and small intestines to close. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe he had never heard of it." Harrington-McGill said. "There 
wasn't even a word for it. This baffled both me and the kennel owner, so we 
began to explore the cause of bloat." 
</P>
<P>
After the two talked, they discovered that dogs in Germany and the United 
States have different diets. German dog food contains mainly fish and no animal 
fat, preservatives or soybeans. In the United States, some of the main 
ingredients are chicken, animal fat, sugar and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
Her conviction that bloat stemmed from dietary differences led 
Harrington-McGill to purchase a recipe Von Maischack had developed over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Great Danes were originally from Germany, it made sense to me that they 
should eat the food they had eaten for generations," she said. "I wasn't sure 
if diet was the main cause for the ailment, but it sounded like the most 
logical one." 
</P>
<P>
After buying two Great Danes, and with her new dog food recipe in hand, she 
returned to this country. For several months after that, she crisscrossed the 
states in search of a mill that would put together her formula. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really hard to get anybody interested in making this formula," she 
said. "It wasn't the ingredients, it was the quantity and type of kibble I 
wanted. I just wanted it for my dogs, so I only needed a little, but most 
manufacturers said they didn't work with small amounts." 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-McGill said she decided to "play it their way," and, after finding a 
receptive mill in Los Angeles, she placed a 10-ton order for small-pellet, 
hard-baked kibbles. 
</P>
<P>
Pleased with the outcome, she said she continued feeding her dogs the kibble 
and noticed how well they responded to it. Apparently, she wasn't the only one 
to notice. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was showing my Great Danes at dog shows, people would comment on their 
gleaming coats and asked what I was feeding them," she said. "That's the first 
thing people ask when they see a dog in good condition." 
</P>
<P>
After a couple of months, she had several people asking her if she could "throw 
in an extra bag of kibble" when ordering her dogs' food from the mill. 
</P>
<P>
"In the begining, I had extra bags so I gave some to my friends," said 
Harrington-McGill, who was working then as an elementary school teacher. "But, 
after a while, I had to put in larger orders to accommodate everyone." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1974, she was ordering 4 to 5 tons of kibble monthly. Realizing 
that there were tantalizing business possibilities, she decided to test her 
dog-food formula to see what form was most marketable. 
</P>
<P>
During those experiments, she said, she found that the hard-baked kibble sold 
best. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a new concept, no one in the United States had anything like it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
By 1978, when Harrington-McGill's monthly manufacturing total had reached 7 
tons, she resigned from her teaching position to give full-time attention to 
her dog-food venture. She also began selling food products for cats, horses and 
other animals. 
</P>
<P>
"You are what you eat, and that goes for animals, too," she said. "Most people 
really care about their animals, so why not give them the best?" 
</P>
<P>
Harrington-McGill started a mail-order business and offered products such as 
Seal Meal, Herbal Wormer, Natural Flea Powder and Natural Flee Shampoo. 
Initially, she ran the business out of her home and a rented warehouse, but in 
1984 she moved to her present location in El Cajon, where, in addition to the 
food, she also sells a animal accessories. 
</P>
<P>
As business grew, so did her marketing strategies. While attending a trade show 
in England, she said she sneaked through an unopen gate in the back of 
Buckingham Palace in an attempt to give her products to Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe I got in there," she said. "But, as soon as I was in, a 
guard caught me and asked me what I wanted. I quickly showed him two of my 
products and asked him if he could give the samples to Her Majesty." 
</P>
<P>
Although the guard assured her that he would do so, Harrington-McGill left 
assuming that he would simply discard her samples after she was gone. Three 
weeks later, however, she was shocked when she received a $1,700 telephone 
order from Buckingham Palace for a product called Solid Gold Golden Edge, which 
contains natural herbs believed to induce calm in animals. 
</P>
<P>
Through word of mouth, her products soon came to the attention of other royalty 
and celebrities. Shortly after the queen's order was placed, she received a 
call from a man she described as an Arab sheik asking for $2,200 worth of her 
products. Over the years, her client list grew to include such notables as 
Frank Sinatra, Zsa Zsa Gabor, William Shatner, Stephanie Powers and director 
John Frankenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her clients, however, are everyday people with the same goal in mind 
that she had at the outset: finding healthy food for their pets. Today, about 
80% of her business is conducted by mail order. The rest of her sales occur at 
her El Cajon store and other outlets throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Solid Gold is the stuff of a health-minded dog owner's dream or just 
one more entrepreneurial spin in in the crowded animal products market is hard 
to say now. Dean Gahring said he wouldn't rule it out that Solid Gold is all 
Harrington-McGill says it is, but there no studies have been done to confirm 
it. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, business has been so good, Harrington-McGill said she hasn't 
had time to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all happened so rapidly, I'm too busy to be surprised," she said. "I just 
keep working at it."

<HEAD>A Princess's Wonderful Day at Coronation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Papa looked very beautiful in his crimson robe,
but there was a terrible draft in Westminster Abbey, wrote the
little princess after her parents' coronation in 1937.
   The childhood essay of Queen Elizabeth II gets its first public
showing beginning Friday in the Queen's Gallery, where royal
treasures are displayed at Buckingham Palace.
   It's part of 271 exhibits called ``A Royal Miscellany'' showing
through Jan. 13, 1991.
   The exhibition includes everything from clocks and jewelry to
the embroidered linen overshirt worn by King Charles I as he knelt
to the headsman's ax in 1649.
   Visitors can view a lock of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's
hair, a watercolor of Balmoral royal estate by Prince Charles, and
a copy of the Mainz Psalter _ a 1457 German collection of prayers
that was the first book printed in more than one color.
   Among the displays are the neat, proper letters of the
11-year-old princess Elizabeth. They are written in a lined
exercise book that would have cost tuppence, four cents at that
time.
   ``I thought it all very, very wonderful and I expect the Abbey
did, too. The arches and beams at the top were covered with a sort
of haze of wonder as Papa was crowned, at least I thought so,''
wrote the princess.
   Elizabeth, her sister Princess Margaret and their widowed
grandmother Queen Mary had a grandstand view of the ceremony from a
royal box in the abbey, where Elizabeth herself would be crowned in
1953.
   ``What struck me as being rather odd was that Grannie did not
remember much of her own coronation. I should have thought that it
would have stayed in her mind forever,'' Princess Elizabeth wrote.
   However, toward the end, the child found the service becoming
``rather boring'' as it was all prayers.
   ``Grannie and I were looking to see how many more pages to the
end, and we turned one more and then I pointed to the word at the
bottom of the page and it said `Finis.' We both smiled at each
other and turned back to the service,'' she wrote.
   ``The princess was probably asked by her tutor to record her
impressions of the coronation,'' said Oliver Everett, director of
the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, the favorite royal residence
21 miles west of London.
   Everett, a former diplomat, selected the essay and 270 other
items for the exhibition.
   ``The library is closed to the public, but the queen takes her
guests there. As the castle is being rewired and repaired, guests
cannot be shown round so we took the opportunity to send some
interesting things to the gallery,'' Everett said in an interview
at Wednesday's preview.
   Even the prophetic thoughts of King George III after the British
defeat by the American colonists in 1781 are displayed: ``America
is lost! Must we fall beneath this blow?'' he wrote.
   But he was consoled by the thought that ``it is to be hoped we
shall reap more advantages from their trade as friends than ever we
could derive from them as Colonies.''

<HEAD>Trooping the Color: Queen Honored On Official Birthday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cavalrymen and foot soldiers in scarlet tunics and
bearskin hats paraded in the center of London Saturday to honor
Queen Elizabeth II with the Trooping the Color on her ``official''
birthday.
   The queen, who is 62, celebrated her real birthday on April 21,
but the official birthday ceremonies are held on the second
Saturday of June when the weather normally is better. The sky was
overcast and there was a damp chill in the air Saturday.
   This year, for the first time since 1973, the 1,588 men of all
five regiments of the Brigade of Guards joined the parade because
all are currently based in London.
   The guards _ Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish and Welsh
regiments _ are often scattered, seeing service in such places as
Northern Ireland and the Falkland Islands.
   Four generations of the royal family joined the ceremony this
year, riding in coaches or on horseback to the Horse Guards Parade,
an open square in Whitehall, where the queen inspected the Irish
Guards while massed bands played.
   Each year one regiment performs the honors, marching in
intricate patterns and carrying the ``color,'' or regimental
standard.
   Elizabeth, wearing a blue coat and wide-brimmed hat, arrived in
a horse-drawn phaeton and took the salute standing on a dais. It
was the second year she had used the carriage since retiring her
horse, Burmese, which she used to ride sidesaddle for the occasion,
wearing a scarlet uniform.
   The queen's 5-year-old grandson, Prince William, was with his
mother, the Princess Diana, and his great-grandmother, Queen Mother
Elizabeth, in her carriage.
   Riding horseback was the heir to the throne, Prince Charles in
his uniform as colonel of the Welsh Guards, along with the queen's
husband, Prince Philip, a colonel of the Grenadier Guards.
   On her return to Buckingham Palace, the queen appeared on a
balcony to wave to her subjects and thousands of tourists.
   Saturday's pageantry was based on the ceremony used for guard
mounting in the 18th century and was first performed on the
sovereign's birthday for King George III. But during the 18th and
19th centuries the trooping was seldom attended by the monarch.
   In 1895, the color was trooped in the quadrangle at Windsor
Castle, west of London, and Queen Victoria took the salute from a
carriage. From that year on, a senior royal person has always been
in attendance.

   News that a handsome aide to the queen wrote
personal letters to Princess Anne prompted new Page One speculation
Monday that Anne's marriage is on the rocks. But her father-in-law
denied the marriage has broken down.
   Anne herself, the 38-year-old daughter of Queen Elizabeth II,
smiled through a typically busy day of engagements.
   As Scotland Yard investigated the theft of the letters from the
princess' desk at Buckingham Palace, Britain's tabloids questioned
in banner headlines whether her 15-year marriage to fellow
equestrian Mark Phillips would survive.
   ``Can This Marriage Be Saved?,'' asked the Daily Mail. ``Anne
Divorce Crisis At Palace,'' said Today. ``Royal Marriage Crisis:
Anne Sad, Shattered, Alone,'' trumpeted the Daily Mirror.
   Maj. Peter Phillips, Anne's 68-year-old father-in-law, denied
the marriage was washed up. He told reporters: ``It's not the sort
of marriage that ordinary people would understand at all _ they
spend so much time away from one another.
   ``If people are royal, they don't necessarily spend lots of time
together. It's inevitable. Princess Anne and Mark come together and
they part, doing the various jobs which they have got to do.
   ``One does not inquire about when they last got together. ... Of
course their marriage is very unusual.''
   Phillips added, ``Mark rang me last night (Sunday). ... He would
confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the conversation
was about horses. ... The marriage side of things was not discussed
at all.''
   The three principals at the heart of the speculation remained
silent on the subject.
   Anne appeared in a happy mood as she carried out a busy schedule
of activities in northwest England including opening a $68 million
shopping center in Liverpool.
   Margaret Maguire, a shopper who talked with Anne, said later,
``She is beautiful _ a credit to her country. It is her own life
and the press should leave her alone.''
   Phillips, a 40-year-old commoner and former captain in The
Queen's Dragoon Guards, spent the day at the couple's Gatcombe Park
estate in western England.
   Royal Navy Cmdr. Timothy Laurence, the 34-year-old bachelor who
wrote the stolen letters, was at Windsor Castle, continuing with
his normal duties as an equerry, or aide, to the queen, Buckingham
Palace said.
   Rumors of trouble in the princess' marriage have circulated
since 1981. In recent years, she and her husband have spent up to
six months a year apart.
   Anne has become the busiest and one of the most admired members
of the royal family, undertaking grueling travels on behalf of
children in poverty-stricken and war-torn Third World countries.
Phillips has also traveled widely for a variety of business and
equestrian interests.
   On their 15th anniversary on Nov. 15, Anne attended a Buckingham
Palace ball while Phillips was giving riding lessons in Australia.
   Britain's tabloids have tried to link Anne to a former bodyguard
and actor Anthony Andrews, and Phillips to one of his stable girls,
a Canadian public relations executive and Pamella Bordes, a former
Miss India who worked as a researcher in the House of Commons.
   The latest rumors began after The Sun, Britain's
largest-circulation tabloid, reported Thursday that four letters
stolen from Anne had been sent anonymously to the paper and turned
over to Scotland Yard.
   After a Sunday newspaper told Buckingham Palace it was going to
name the letter-writer, the palace identified Laurence, who served
on the royal yacht Britannia before become a top aide to the queen.
It described him as a friend of the princess' but refused to
disclose the contents.
   The Daily Mirror, which called the letters ``highly personal,''
said Monday that the princess had visited Laurence's home in
Winchester at least half a dozen times, sometimes with her two
children, Peter, 11, and Zara, 7.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage,
said: ``The matter cannot be left hanging in the air like this.''
   There is a precedent for a royal divorce. Anne's aunt, Princess
Margaret, the queen's only sister, was divorced in 1978 from Lord
Snowden, who has since remarried. Anne herself is seventh in line
to the throne, far enough down the line of succession not to create
problems for the monarchy if she were to divorce.
   Nigel Dempster, Britain's best-known gossip columnist who writes
in The Daily Mail, said Anne and Phillips haven't divorced because
neither wants to marry someone else.
   ``I think everyone including Mark and the royal family have been
aware that the marriage as such had been over for a very long
time,'' he told the BBC.

   All, it would seem, was bliss at Buckingham Palace.
   Prince Charles and Diana emerged unscathed from a spate of rumors
about their marriage. Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, are happily
raising a baby. Prince Edward gave up military life and apparently
found peace with a theater company.
   Queen Elizabeth II was the picture of grandmotherly contentment.
   But now, suddenly, shocking headlines! Headstrong Princess Anne
and her shy commoner husband are splitting up. Is the British royal
family in trouble?
   Not really. It has survived worse crises, only to grow in
prestige and popularity. And compared with the scandals that beset
some of their ancestors, the separation announced Thursday of the
queen's daughter from Capt. Mark Phillips is small potatoes.
   ``Many, many royal marriages have been very unhappy indeed,''
says Michelle Brown, curator of the Royal Britain Exhibition.
``There have been lots of royal divorces in the past, and many
people far more miserable than Capt. Phillips and Princess Anne seem
to have been.''
   Like the unfortunate Sophia Dorothea, whose husband, George I,
locked her in a castle for 32 years for being unfaithful to him in
1694.
   Or, more recently, the drawn-out saga of Princess Margaret, the
queen's younger sister, whose marriage to Lord Snowdon ended in
divorce in 1978.
   And then there was 19th-century George IV, whose attempts to
divorce Caroline of Brunswick became a prolonged and disgraceful
public spectacle.
   Anne and Mark, who have two children, do not plan to divorce,
Buckingham Palace says.
   While most newspapers ran the split on the front page Friday, The
Independent ran just one paragraph on page 2. The Independent simply
doesn't believe the royals matter. Others enjoy them as soap opera.
   ``No scriptwriter could wish for a better cast,'' the columnist
Godfrey Smith has written: Queen Elizabeth II as ``everyone's
favorite mum,'' Prince Margaret the ``willful younger sister,''
Prince Philip ``the cantankerous father,'' ``interesting children
(cheerful Charlie, randy Andy, educated Edward and angular Anne),
all sorts of in-laws (divine Diana, problem-girl Princess Michael),
grandchildren galore...''
   There is, however, genuine sympathy for Anne.
   Her marriage in 1973 to Phillips, televised from Westminster
Abbey, was dubbed a storybook romance, but rested mainly on a shared
passion for horses, and marital strife has been rumored for eight
years.
   Anne's short temper and caustic tongue earned her an unpopular
image that only changed in the 1980s through her quiet, sustained
and often courageous work on behalf of the world's needy children.
   She may never rival Princess Diana in looks, and as seventh in
line to the throne she is unlikely to become Queen Anne. But she is
blessed with wit, poise and intellect, and at 39 she is by far the
most interesting of the British royals.
   ``We are very possessive about our royal family, and we were all,
in a sense, guests at that fairy-tale wedding 15 years ago,'' The
Times editorialized Friday. ``The queen's daughter has never been a
fairy-tale princess, however, and the monarchy is the stronger for
it.''
   Indeed, the line was taken by some newspapers that the marriage
was a sham, and that its end came as a relief.
   Other European countries also treasure their royals, and scandals
are far fewer. Belgium hasn't had any problems since King Leopold
III married a commoner in 1941 without his government's approval.
Holland's Princess Irene scandalized Protestants by converting to
Catholicism to marry a Spaniard, but her divorce 17 years later
barely caused a ripple. The Swedish and Danish royal families are
squeaky clean.
   So, for the most part, is the British family. But when it does
arise, divorce is always an emotional issue, from much-married Henry
VIII four centuries ago to Edward VIII, who had to abdicate in 1936
to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson.
   ``It was only since Queen Victoria and Prince Albert set up this
wonderful sort of epitome of the perfect family that the pressure
existed,'' curator Brown told London Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   ``Before then, royal marriages had all the rough and tumble and
all the problems of any other marriage and nobody tried to pretend
otherwise.''

   PITTSBURGH -- When it comes to publicity, Mellon Bank
Corp. keeps shooting itself in the foot.
   First, the Pittsburgh bank offended Nabisco Brands Inc.
with a full-page advertisement depicting an Oreo cookie minus
the cream. Nabisco, a unit of RJR Nabisco Inc., viewed the ad
as a violation of the Oreo icon.

   Now, a new Mellon ad for a "Phone In &amp; Win $10,000" game
has sent Buckingham Palace into a tizzy. The ad features a
photo of Queen Elizabeth II, her forefinger pointing at
something. "Your forefinger can get you five figures," the ad
proclaims. Different versions of the ad, which began running
in local publications last month, feature photos of former
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and former Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev pointing their forefingers.
   In the U.K., commercial uses of the queen are simply not
tolerated. "It's not done, at least not by reputable firms,"
says Nick Brown, a spokesman for the British Embassy in
Washington. Offending companies receive tersely worded royal
reprimands, often from the Lord Chamberlain's office at
Buckingham Palace. Although the admonitions don't carry the
force of law, Mr. Brown says they tend to discourage
companies from improperly using the royal family's images.
Foreign companies aren't exempt from the consequences of
British indignation. The British Embassy sent a letter to
Mellon this week requesting the ad be withdrawn.
   What's the big deal? British comics have long made the
queen a butt of ridicule. Consider, for example, the raunchy
irreverence of Monty Python. Mr. Brown objects to the
comparison. "That's different from trying to use the queen or
the royal family for commercial gain," he says, adding a bit
defensively that "we've got a sense of humor. I'd say
probably more than a lot of Americans have. We're not afraid
of being satirical about public figures. A lot of that goes
on in Britain. But this is about whether it's right to use
images of members of the royal family to try to sell a
product."
   A Mellon spokesman says the bank pulled the offending ad
before hearing from the British government. The decision was
made, he says, after several customers complained about the
light-hearted treatment of Queen Elizabeth and Mr. Gorbachev.
No one seemed to mind with Mrs. Thatcher.
   Mellon doesn't view the tiff with Buckingham Palace as yet
another publicity gaffe on Mellon's part. Indeed, it believes
the publicity surrounding the Oreo cookie incident worked to
Mellon's benefit. Mellon eventually redid the ad, that time
with the cream intact.
   The bank staunchly defends the ad agency that created both
offending ads, Werner, Chepelsky &amp; Partners, Pittsburgh.
"What you want to do with advertising is provoke a reaction,"
the Mellon spokesman says.
