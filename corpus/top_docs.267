   Rain fell over parts of the Northwest today, while fair weather
prevailed across much of the rest of the nation.
   Today's forecast calls for rain over the Upper and Lower
Rockies, from Colorado into Montana and North Dakota, and scattered
storms in Texas and the Midwest.

Michigan, parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley, eastern Texas and
Oklahoma.
   Showers and storms developed along a cold front extending from
Minnesota to Colorado. Rain also fell over the northern Plains and
the southern Rockies.
   Storms over the Texas Panhandle spawned a tornado and produced
golf ball- size hail south of the town of McLean.
   Forecasters said more severe weather was likely today in
Oklahoma after a tornado caused extensive property damage in
Shattuck.
   Fair skies prevailed from the Southeastern states into the Ohio
Valley and the mid-Atlantic coast.

   Bone-chilling cold in the West collided with a rare winter warm
front over the East today, generating heavy snow, sleet and rain
that caused serious flooding in parts of the South.
   A slew of winter weather warnings and advisories were posted
from coast to coast as the Arctic front that froze most of the West
last week edged toward the Atlantic.
   Snow fell today in the Ohio Valley, and was forecast for the
northern Cascades and Rocky Mountains, northern Plains and Great
Lakes region.
   Heavy rain was expected in the East, Southeast and Appalachian
states.
   Subfreezing temperatures were common throughout the West and
Midwest.
   After record highs throughout the East on Sunday, including 71
degrees as far north as Washington, D.C., and highs in the 60s into
southern Maine, temperatures cooled considerably today.
   By Christmas Day, East Coast highs were likely to peak around 30
degrees. A cold snap continued in the West, but frigid temperatures
were expected to moderate somewhat.

   A blast of frigid air continued to move through the nation's
midsection today, as thunderstorms were pushing out the warm
weather that the East has had since the weekend.
   Tornadoes in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas and
Kentucky caused hundreds of injuries and many deaths Wednesday.
   Wintery weather swept into Michigan, bringing snow that put a
chill on the opening day of deer season and was a factor in an auto
accident in which four teen-agers were killed.
   Temperatures early this morning fell to freezing in Chicago and
Peoria, 30 in Rockford and 33 in Decatur as a light snow dusted
central Illinois.
   On Wednesday, temperatures dipped into the teens and single
digits from eastern Montana through the Dakotas to northwestern
Minnesota by early evening. Winds gusting to 40 mph produced wind
chill readings colder than 25 degrees below zero.
   There were dozens of reports of large hail and damaging winds in
Kentucky, Alabama and Mississippi on Wednesday, while thunderstorms
produced heavy rain across parts of the Ohio Valley, Tennessee and
the central Gulf Coast states.
   In Ohio, thunderstorms produced an inch of rain in half an hour
in Fairfield, 1.75 inches of rain in 20 minutes at Wayne, and 1.7
inches of rain in 20 minutes at Trenton.
   Snow fell across the upper Mississippi Valley and western
sections of the Great Lakes region Wednesday night, with heavy snow
today along the southern shore of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan.
   Up to a foot of snow was expected to fall today in upper
Michigan and storm warnings and watches were in effect for lower
Michigan and northern Indiana. Gale warnings were in effect for
Lake Superior and Lake Michigan.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 92 degrees at McAllen, Texas.

   Rain fell across the South early today, and a cold winterlike
blast with some snow hit the northern United States.
   Much of the nation was under cloudy skies. Temperatures early
today along the lower Eastern seaboard and Gulf coast were in the
60s.
   Rain fell along the mid-Mississippi valley, central Alabama and
the South Carolina coast.
   Temperatures dipped into the high teens and low 20s from
Montana, across the Great Plains and into New York state.
   Snow fell in Boston, Buffalo, N.Y., and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.,
as well as in Denver. Up to a foot of snow was likely in
California's northern Sierra Nevada.
   Light snow mixed with ice was expected in parts of the northern
Plains. Snow was likely in Wyoming.
   Rain fell in Oregon early today, and a cold front moving in from
the Pacific was expected to bring heavy snow later in the day to
the mountains of Oregon and Northern California.
   The nation's high on Thursday was 84 degrees at Alice,
Kingsville and McAllen, Texas.

   A storm that dumped up to 10 inches of snow on Michigan's Lower
Peninsula headed out of the state today, leaving cloudy skies and
low temperatures.
   The tail of the storm produced flurries in the Detroit area and
rain elsewhere in Michigan.
   More snow - up to five inches - was forecast today across the
Midwest into Wyoming, Utah and Colorado.
   The Northeast looked for early rain, followed by mostly, sunny
windy weather. Mostly sunny skies were forecast for the far West,
Southwest, Texas and Southeast.
   Winds of 60 mph and stronger were forecast through tonight in
California's Sierra Nevada.
   Stormy weather is forecast through Wednesday in the northwest
gulf of Alaska, with winds of 115 mph expected through the Barren
Islands.
   The high temperature for the nation Monday was 86 degrees at

   Floodwaters in north-central Texas were receding early today,
while the northwestern tier got snow and rain dampened parts of the
South and Midwest.
   Tornadoes spawned by thunderstorms touched down Friday near
Magee, Miss., and near the Texas towns of Waco, Coolidge, Groesbeck
and Hearne, the National Weather Service said.
   At least 200 homes in the Texas community of Horseshoe Bend,
which is ringed by the rain-swollen Brazos River, remained under
water Friday, authorities said.
   Water stood 4 feet deep in the streets of Brownwood, Texas,
receding slowly. Lake Brownwood couldn't handle 16 inches of rain
since Wednesday, authorities said.
   ``It's going to be a long-term thing, two or three weeks minimum
before businesses are back in operation,'' Brownwood Mayor Bert
Massey said.
   ``It's the worst disaster to ever hit Brownwood. We're talking
about millions upon millions of dollars in damages in the business
district alone,'' he said.
   Hail also battered Texas, including hailstones nearly an inch in
diameter southeast of Dallas and north of Kerens. Hail the size of
golf balls fell on Hillsboro and several other Texas cities.
   Rain early today fell in St. Louis, Des Moines, Iowa, Little
Rock, Ark., Nashville, Tenn., Birmingham, Ala., Boise, Idaho,
Medford, Ore., Spokane, Wash.
   Rapid City got snow.
   The National Weather Service posted a winter storm warning for
today over the western mountains of Montana. Snow advisories were
posted today elsewhere in Montana and parts of Idaho, Washington
state, Oregon and Wyoming.
   Unseasonably cold temperatures, with snow in higher elevations,
were predicted today for the northern Sierra Nevada region and the
northern mountains of California.
   Utah could receive a foot of snow in higher mountains by Sunday
night.
   High temperatures Friday from the northern Atlantic Coast to the
upper Great Lakes were milder than usual. The weather service said
more than 36 high temperature records for the date were broken or
tied.
   The new temperature records include a high of 86 degrees in
Bridgeport, Conn., 89 degrees in Cape Hatteras, N.C., and 92
degrees in Boston.
   The high Friday in the Lower 48 states was 105 degrees in
Borrego Springs, Calif.

   Thunderstorms produced hail and high winds in the South, and
skies were dry most everywhere west of the Rockies.
   Storms were severe Sunday in portions of Texas, Mississippi,
Alabama and North Carolina, the National Weather Service said.
   Hail the size of golf balls fell in Andrews, Texas; Highland
Home, Ala.; Wheeling, W.Va., and De Kalb, Miss. High winds downed
trees and power lines in Alabama.
   Winds gusted to 58 mph in Montgomery and a trailer home was
overturned near Ansley in Alabama. Charlotte, N.C., was whipped by
gusts of 78 mph.
   The weather service said thunderstorms spawned a tornado near
Winters, Texas.
   Virginia and Louisiana also received thunderstorms.
   Light rain and drizzle fell over New York state and Vermont.
Light rain ahead of a cold front extended from Illinois to upper
Michigan.
   Showers were scattered over Arizona and Aouthern California. Dry
weather prevailed elsewhere in the West, with fair skies over much
of the Central Plains.
   The high Sunday in the Lower 48 states was 89 degrees in Miami.

   Rain fell in the eastern half of the nation and in the Upper
Plains early today, flooding portions of Ohio.
   Rain and showers extended from Cleveland to Buffalo to Richmond,
Va., and from Casper, Wyo., to Spokane, Wash. Thunderstorms looped
down from Kansas to the Georgia coast and up to South Carolina.
   On Monday, wet, stormy weather advanced across the southeastern
quarter of the nation, spinning off at least four tornados.
Lightning killed one person in Galveston Island, Texas.
   Heavy rain overnight flooded parts of eastern and south-central
Ohio, leaving many roads impassable.
   Floodwaters up to 6 feet deep swamped Murray City, forcing the
evacuation of at least 50 residents, authorities said. The flooding
shoved one building off its foundations, caved in a hillside and
swept equipment out of a firehouse.
   ``The streets are a mess. In 1968 we had a flood, but it was
nothing like this,'' said firefighter Bob Koon. ``We got the trucks
out, but a lot of the other stuff is gone.''
   Tornadoes touched down near Atlanta, southeast of Houma, La.,
and west of Huntington, W.Va.
   At Morehead in eastern Kentucky, a twister overturned several
light aircraft and a small hangar at Morehead-Rowan County Airport
and apparently carried off two other planes, state police said. It
also downed power lines, destroyed a small office and damaged two
houses. No injuries were reported.
   Hail fell at Maiden, N.C., Midway, W.Va., Baldwin, Ga., and
North Knoxville, Tenn.
   Today's forecast called for rain in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming
and across the Northeast. Storms were expected in Kansas, Oklahoma,
northern Texas, northern Florida and along the coasts of Georgia
and South Carolina.
   A high of 73 in Nome, Ark., broke the town's Memorial Day record
of 70 degrees that had stood for 27 years.
   The nation's high was 99 at Beeville, Texas.

   Rain dampened southern New England today and searing heat
gripped the Plains and eastern Rockies.
   Temperatures were expected to approach 110 degrees in Nebraska
and Kansas. Unseasonably warm weather also was expected in
Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri.
   Today's forecast also called for rain in Idaho, Montana and
southern New England and storms in southern Texas, Georgia and
Alabama and from Minnesota to Missouri.
   Strong thunderstorms were scattered across the eastern half of
the nation from Pennsylvania to Alabama on Sunday.
   Storms produced baseball-size hail at Driver and Chesapeake,
Va., and at Middlesboro, Ky., where winds downed trees and power
lines and destroyed a home.
   Temperatures rose above 90 in most areas between the southern
Atlantic Coast and the high Plains, with readings above 100 in
Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado and Montana.
   Two dozen cities reported record highs for the date. Charleston,
S.C., equalld its July record of 103 degrees.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 125 at Death Valley, Calif.

   Thunderstorms today soaked Louisville, Memphis, and Nashville,
Tenn., and Pittsburgh. Rain also fell in Cleveland, Detroit,
Chicago and Indianapolis.
   More rain was forecast for north and central Texas, where the
release of rain-swollen reservoirs has caused heavy flooding, loss
of life and widespread agricultural damage.
   Flood watches were posted for today over much of New York into
Vermont.
   Skies were fair over much of the lower Eastern Seaboard. Western
skies were patchy with clouds.
   On Wednesday, damaging tornadoes touched down southwest of
Magnolia, Ark., and southeast Worth County in Georgia.
   Torrential rains and winds of up to 50 mph hammered Kentucky
late Wedneday night, battering at least 15 homes at a trailer park
outside Elizabethtown and injuring several residents.
   Flooding continued in parts of Illinois, Missouri and Louisiana.
   Baseball-size hail fell near Fouke, Ark., and hail the size of
golfballs fell at Fairview, W. Va., and Sullivan and Villa Ridge,
Mo.

   Rain was widespread across the Deep South today and was
scattered across the Midwest and northeast.
   Rain and rising temperatures melted snow across much of the
higher elevations in western Washington state, causing rivers to

Oregon coasts. High wind alerts were issued in eastern Wyoming, the
Columbia basin of Oregon and the Idaho panhandle.
   Gusts of 70 mph were recorded in eastern Wyoming on Thursday

<HEAD>Rain Spreads Across East; Clear and Cooler Elsewhere</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michigan and Ohio residents awakened to a rainy Thanksgiving
Day, with the precipitation expected to spread as far south as
Texas, while most of the West and Midwest basked in clear but
cooler weather.
   The rain, spreading from the Great Lakes region, along the
inland edges of several East Coast states and into the South, was
caused by an unusually cold front of air from the north colliding
with a warm front moving up from the South.
   The conditions also brought rain to Kentucky early today and
cloudy or foggy skies to Massachusetts, New York, the Carolinas,
Florida, Georgia and Oklahoma.
   Clear skies blanketed most of the rest of the country, but a
winter storm watch was in effect in the Pacific Northwest. Strong
winds were reported in parts of Oregon and snow was expected
tonight in Washington and Idaho.
   Highs were in the 40s and 50s across the Northeast and Great
Lakes region, dipping into the 30s along parts of the Canadian
border. Highs were in the 60s and 70s in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic
and most Western states, with highs in the 70s and 80s in the
South.
   High temperature for the nation Wednesday was 89 degrees at
McAllen, Texas. Other reports as of 5:30 p.m. EST:

   Thunderstorms moved into the South early today, and for the third
straight day were over parts of the Ohio Valley, the central Plains
and Mississippi Valley.
   Rain fell in the southern tip of Florida and the coastal Pacific
Northwest.
   Showers also dampened the Great Lakes region, as a warm front
moved up from the Gulf of Mexico. The front was expected to be
pushed east by the jet stream and bring evening thunderstorms to
much of New England.
   There were mostly clear skies and fair weather in the West.
   Early today, thunderstorms were over central Georgia and the
coast of South Carolina. Thunderstorms also were over Iowa,
Nebraska, Indiana and Michigan.
   Thunderstorms developing along a warm front produced severe
weather in the central Plains and the mid-Mississippi Valley on
Thursday.
   The storms over eastern Kansas spawned at least three tornadoes,
two in Missouri, two in South Dakota
   Almost 1{ inches of rain deluged Max, S.D., in 30 minutes.
   Golf-ball size hail was reported in eastern Nebraska, eastern
Kansas and southern Illinois.
   Winds gusted to 80 mph over central-western Iowa.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies prevalent from California to the western edge of the Plains.

   Hurricane Hugo ripped into South Carolina today and rain and
thunderstorms that spun off of the storm were scattered across much
of the eastern United States, while an arctic cold front bore down
on the Great Lakes.
   Skies were clear over most of the West.
   Showers and thundershowers were reported Thursday from the Gulf
Coast north into the Ohio River Valley and into New England.
Thunderstorms also struck the lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas.
   The Great Lakes region was expected to usher in autumn Saturday
with a chill. A cold front approaching the area today could drop the
mercury 20 degrees overnight, according to the National Weather
Service, and frost is likely.
   Hurricane winds over 100 mph knocked out power to the entire city
of Charleston, S.C. and cracked the roof at City Hall. The storm
ripped off roofs and snapped and uprooted trees in parts of the
state.
   Temperatures elsewhere Wednesday afternoon climbed into the 90s
in much of Florida, the 80s across the south, the 90s in southern
Texas and the 80s and 90s in the desert Southwest.

North Dakota today, and sharply colder temperatures were expected
by week's end in much of the nation east of the Rockies.
   Warm and moist air ahead of the arctic mass was expected to
bring severe thunderstorms, damaging winds and even tornadoes from
the Mississippi Valley into the Southeast.
   Snowfall totals of 3 to 8 inches were expected today in
northwest Wisconsin, with winds blowing and drifting the snow. More
than a foot of snow was possible in upper Michigan.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing this morning across the
Dakotas and 40 mph winds produced wind chill readings of 15 to 35
degrees below zero.
   Light snow fell Tuesday night over Minnesota, eastern North
Dakota, northwest Wisconsin, and parts of Colorado. Up to 4{ inches
of new snow blanketed some ski areas, with winds of up to 50 mph.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the lower and
middle Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic Coast on Tuesday night.
   Temperatures warmed above 70 degrees Tuesday across the Atlantic
Coast, with highs in the 80s across Florida.
   Nineteen cities _ including Syracuse, N.Y.; Tampa, Fla.; Tulsa,
Okla., and Dallas _ reported new record high temperatures for the
date.
   Temperatures also warmed into the 70s and 80s in the Southwest
but were in the 30s across much of the northern Plains, the upper
Mississippi Valley, and across northern Maine.

<TEXT>
   Unseasonably warm weather swept across the eastern third of the
nation today, breaking records set nearly 100 years ago, and snow
fell in the West.
   A strong cold front moving eastward pushed rain ahead of it and
brought cold in its wake.
   Rain fell in Chicago, Indianapolis, Memphis, Tenn., and
Louisville.
   Just after midnight Buffalo, N.Y., hit 70 degrees, breaking the
old record for the date by 2 degrees. That record was established
94 years ago.
   The forecast in the Northeast called for temperatures to climb
well into the 60s and likely top 70 degrees in New York City and as
far north as Boston.
   The Ohio Valley had temperatures in the high 60s today, and
forecasters said temperatures would plunge about 20 degrees as the
day progressed.
   In the Midwest, temperatures dropped in the 20s. Snow was
falling today in Des Moines, Iowa, and Minneapolis.
   Snow also fell in Salt Lake City.
   Rain was likely in the Pacific Northwest.

<TEXT>
   Rain sprinkled the eastern third of the nation early today and
temperatures cooled in the Pacific Northwest after a scorching day
of temperatures shooting well past the century mark.
   The northern Plains, Rockies and desert Southwest were mostly
dry, but severe thunderstorms, with a chance of tornadoes, were
expected in eastern Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi.
   Heavy showers also could develop in the Virginias.
   At midnight Thursday, temperatures had dipped to 83 degrees in
Pendleton, Ore., and to 79 at Boise, Idaho. Earlier in Washington
state, Pasco hit 116, Hanford reached 110 and it was 108 in Walla
Walla.
   Torrid temperatures were expected to cool in the Northwest
today, and thunderstorms over eastern Washington state were moving
toward Montana.
   In the Southwest, temperatures were likely to soar past 100.
   Death Valley, Calif., had a high of 125 degrees on Thursday, and
in Arizona, Bullhead City and Lake Havasu City hit 116.
   Rain fell across much of the Northeast early today, and was
scattered across the South and Ohio Valley. Rain also fell in parts
of the Midwest.
   A cold front extending from the Great Lakes was likely to push
cool air across the Plains to northern Texas, bringing unseasonably
cool temperatures.
   Moist air from the South will collide with a stationary front
stretching across the Appalachias from western Tennessee to
northern Virginia. Heavy rains were expected just north of the
front.

   Scattered rain pelted the nation from the eastern seaboard to
the Mississippi River early today, and heavy thunderstorms were
likely in the central Appalachians and Ohio Valley.
   Mostly dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   Another hot day was expected today in the West, following a week
of scorching temperatures and heavy electrical use.
   Unseasonably cool and damp weather in the Northeast was likely
to subside and New England was likely to have warm, dry weather.
   Today's forecast called for sunny and dry weather from the Great
Lakes to the northern plains of Texas.
   Partly cloudy skies and some scattered rain were forecast for
the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians, and thunderstorms were
likely to unleash heavy rains in some areas, bringing a chance for
flooding.
   Thunderstorms were likely over the southern Rockies, with some
flash flooding possible in desert regions. Flooding also was
possible in the South.
   In Northern California temperatures climbed past 100 degrees in
many areas on Friday, and thunderstorms brought heavy rain showers
in the Sierras.
   Record electricity use was reported in the region.
   Red Bluff and Redding had highs of 111 degrees; it was 108 in
Fresno and Paso Robles; 107 in Sacramento; 106 in Stockton and 103

   After a final spell of rain in the Cascade Range today, clearing
skies and colder temperatures were expected to ease flooding that
caused property damage and prompted evacuations in northwest
Washington and British Columbia.
   Days of heavy rains and melting snow in the mountains caused
rivers and streams to overflow, and flood warnings remained in
effect this morning.
   The worst property damage was along the Nooksack River east of
Bellingham, where a house and two trailers, a highway bridge and a
minor railroad span were swept away.
   Rain slackened overnight Thursday, but the National Weather
Service said heavy rains in the central Cascade mountains today
could raise river levels again.
   High winds, meanwhile, continued along the eastern slopes of the
Rocky Mountains on Friday. In Montana, winds were 35 to 50 mph,
with gusts of more than 100 mph along the front range west of
Choteau.
   Rain showers extended from the Pacific Northwest to Montana. In
the East showers were also scattered across New York state,
southern New England and northern Pennsylvania.
   Thunderstorms were over extreme southeastern New England. A
thunderstorm at Nantucket Island in Massachusetts produced wind
gusts to 58 mph.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation Friday, with
fair skies in much of the southern and western United States.
   But high temperatures were only in the 30s in the upper
Mississippi Valley and the upper Great Lakes region.
   Temperatures warmed into the 60s and 70s Friday in the northern
Plains and the Pacific Northwest and into the 80s across much of
Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and across the Florida
Peninsula. Temperatures soared into the 80s and 90s in the
southwestern deserts.
   The high Friday was 96 degrees at Thermal and Palm Springs,
Calif.
