   Rupert Murdoch's NEWS CORP., which sold its television interests in Australia just two weeks ago so it could take over the country's biggest media company, is returning to the television business there. 

   Transactions announced yesterday would give News Corp. a 15% holding in television stations in Sydney and Melbourne -- the country's two biggest cities -- and in the smaller cities of Lismore and Coffs Harbor. 

   Earlier this month, News Corp. sold its television stations in Melbourne and Sydney, plus some small newspapers, radio stations and a recording concern, to Westfield Capital Corp. for the equivalent of $561.3 million. 
Westfield, in turn, plans to sell the media interests to a company controlled by its Northern Star Holdings Ltd. 

   Northern Star plans to put its current television operations in Lismore and Coffs Harbor into this unit, keep a 75% stake, and sell 15% of the unit to News Corp. for an undisclosed sum. 

   News Corp. said its Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. unit will "enjoy a close association" with Northern Star's television company. 

   In order to buy Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd. earlier this month, Mr. Murdoch was forced to sell his television stations in Australia because foreigners aren't allowed to own more than 15% of an Australian television station. 
Herald, Australia's biggest media group, owned television and radio stations, as well as newspapers and magazines.

   Australia's third national commercial-television network was formed when QINTEX LTD. acquired TV stations in the nation's three biggest cities from JOHN FAIRFAX LTD. for 780 million Australian dollars ($554 million). 

   Fairfax, one of Australia's biggest publishers, will retain an interest in the network by acquiring as much as 15% of Qintex. 
Qintex, a media, resorts and property concern, already owned some smaller TV stations. 

   The agreement, in which Fairfax is selling its stations in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, follows an accord earlier this year in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. sold its TV stations to Northern Star Holdings Ltd. and acquired 15% of Northern Star. 
Also this year, the entrepreneur Alan Bond formed the country's first commercial network by acquiring several stations from Kerry Packer, another Australian businessman. 

   The transactions followed a liberalization of government curbs on media ownership.

FT  08 JUN 93 / International Company News: IEL sells undertaker business

INDUSTRIAL Equity (IEL), the Australian investment group, has sold Pine
Grove, Australia's biggest undertaker, for ADollars 102m (USDollars 69.3m).
The buyer is Service Corp, the US funeral company.
IEL, which is part of the Adsteam group, said the sale would yield a book
profit of about ADollars 25m, and the proceeds could be used for payments to
shareholders.
The purchase is the first outside North America by Service Corp, estimated
to be the world's largest funeral company. It will add about ADollars 47m to
its revenue. Pine Grove controls between 13 and 16 per cent of the
Australian funeral market.
Mr R. Waltrip, chairman of Service Corp, said the acquisition represented
the beginning of a truly global company. The deal is subject to Australia's
Foreign Investment Review Board.
IEL is also in the throes of selling its Woolworths supermarket chain, which
is the subject of a planned ADollars 2.45bn public flotation.
Westpac Banking, the big Australian bank, plans to sack 12 per cent of the
staff at its head office for New Zealand operations, Reuter reports from
Sydney. Westpac currently employs 700 people at the Wellington office.
The decision to make staff redundant follows a review of the bank's
operations by an independent consultant.
The review 'identified a number of activities and structures that are no
longer necessary for the current market environment and have been dispensed
with', the bank said.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Australia's banks reveal
diverse results - The ripples from Westpac's property write-offs are
spreading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seldom has an Australian bank reporting season produced such a diversity of
results. In the space of a few days, six-month results have cast Westpac as
the poor relation, ANZ as the battling improver and the National Australia
Bank as a comfortable top performer.
The banks' experiences with Australia's crop of failed entrepreneurs have
been well-chronicled. The big banks, including the 70 per cent federal
government-controlled Commonwealth Bank, were naturally the most injured by
corporate failures and falling asset values.
But the stock market did not begin to suspect until a few months ago that
one bank out of the big four had performed substantially worse than its
rivals. Its worst fears were confirmed last week when Westpac reported a
thumping ADollars 2.65bn (USDollars 2bn) bad debt write-off.
That pushed Westpac into the first loss in its 175-year history, a ADollars
2.3bn pre-tax deficit and forced the bank to turn to shareholders with
potentially Australia's largest share issue, aimed at raising ADollars
1.2bn.
Worse still, it appears the bank needs the funds to avoid falling below the
Reserve Bank's prescribed capital adequacy ratios later this year when about
ADollars 700m in future tax benefits can no longer be counted as assets for
prudential purposes.
The drama of Westpac's losses, which mainly reflected an overhaul of its
extensive property portfolio, is likely to place the bank at a competitive
disadvantage against its peers for some time to come.
It was a drama singularly lacking from the National and ANZ earnings
reports, which had a strong 'business as usual' flavour. The ANZ and the
National did however appear to react to the Westpac shocks by making a point
of detailing their own more modest property exposures.
The ripples have spread quickly from Westpac's property write-offs, with
Australia's biggest home builder Jennings Industries effectively placing
itself at the mercy of its bankers earlier this week following a total
write-off of its stake in a ADollars 650m Melbourne property development.
Ownership of the project has reverted 100 per cent to Westpac, but the
Jennings write-offs, among other factors have caused its major shareholder,
New Zealand's biggest company Fletcher Challenge, to foreshadow a NZDollars
400m (USDollars 215m) property write-down in the current year.
And yesterday, Australia's second biggest life office, the National Mutual,
had the long-term rating of its finance company lowered from A1 to A3 by
Moody's Investor Services, the US credit rating agency.
'The oversupply of commercial real estate throughout Australia will likely
result in additional property write-downs, further affecting National
Mutual's reserve position,' Moody's analysts said.
While Westpac remains Australia's biggest bank measured by total assets, the
accompanying table indicates its position is far inferior to its rivals on
almost all important counts.
Most notably, the bank's large ADollars 8.19bn problem loan portfolio - more
than the ANZ and the National combined - poses the danger that its
write-offs will remain larger for the next few years.
The National's superior position has resulted largely from its ability to
control its finance offshoot. The National was the only bank whose finance
arm was in the black for the half-year, with its Custom Credit operation
turning a ADollars 68m loss into a ADollars 6.4m profit.
Finance offshoots are where much of the big banks' problems have resided.
Witness Westpac's ADollars 850m capital injection into its Australian
Guarantee Corporation subsidiary which lost ADollars 719m. ANZ's Esanda
operation lost almost ADollars 34m.

FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Westpac facing new uncertainty
as MD is fired
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corp-oration, the troubled Australian bank, was yesterday
facing further uncertainty after the board fired Mr Frank Conroy, managing
director, after only 14 months in the job.
Mr John Uhrig, who took over as chairman following an earlier board
reshuffle in October, said a new managing director would be appointed from
outside the bank within a month.
Mr Uhrig said that Mr Conroy had resigned following agreement among
directors that the bank's restructuring programme needed to be controlled by
'someone who comes fresh to the task'.
This contrasts starkly with the strong support for Mr Conroy expressed by Mr
Uhrig and the rest of the board when the bank's restructuring plan was
announced last month.
Yesterday's board meeting was the first attended by Mr Kerry Packer, the
publishing entrepreneur, who acquired a 10 per cent stake in Westpac in
November through Consolidated Press Holdings (ConsPress), his private
company.
Analysts said it was clear that Mr Conroy had refused to bow to pressure
from Mr Packer and Mr Al Dunlap, ConsPress managing director, for bigger
cuts in staffing and assets.
Similar suggestions have been made by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest
financial institution, which owns 15 per cent of Westpac and also has two
seats on the board.
Westpac, once Australia's biggest bank, has faced growing problems over the
last two years as a result of bad debts which culminated in a loss of
ADollars 1.56bn (USDollars 1.07bn) for the year to the end of September.
The bank was humiliated by the failure of a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue in
October, which closed 72 per cent under-subscribed, leaving nearly 300m
unwanted shares in the hands of sub-underwriters.
Five directors resigned shortly after the rights issue debacle, including
Sir Eric Neal, chairman.
Mr Conroy's frank approach to the bank's problems appeared to have won the
support of the markets, reflected in an improvement in the share price from
a low of ADollars 2.39 in November to ADollars 3.03 on Wednesday.
However, the shares rose 1 cent to ADollars 3.04 after the announcement of
Mr Conroy's resignation, suggesting that investors share Mr Packer's view
that restructuring could be accelerated.
The programme announced by Mr Conroy included cutting costs and increasing
revenue by ADollars 300m this year; cutting the expenses-to-income ratio
from 70 per cent to 58 per cent over three years; and reducing corporate
risk assets by ADollars 10bn by 1995.
Westpac has confirmed that the cost-cutting programme could include a
reduction of up to 60 per cent in head office staff.
The bank is also reviewing its regional operations in the south Pacific and
North America.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Kmart acquires stake in
Australian grocer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KMART, the US retailer, has put itself into the forefront of the battle to
rationalise the Australian grocery industry by paying ADollars 20.5m
(USDollars 13.7m) for a 10.8 per cent stake in Independent Holdings, the
South Australian wholesaler.
Kmart, which controls just over 20 per cent of Coles Myer, Australia's
biggest retailer, revealed itself yesterday as the buyer of a parcel of 3.2m
Independent shares traded at ADollars 6.45 earlier this week.
The Kmart move follows the recent purchase of a 19.9 per cent stake in
Independent by Davids Holdings, the privately-controlled Australian grocery
wholesaler. Foodland Associated, another big Australian grocery group, also
controls 18.5 per cent of Independent.
The Kmart purchase was seen yesterday by analysts as a move friendly to
Coles Myer, which has recently moved to block acquisitions in the grocery
industry which is one of its major supply sources.
Earlier this year, Coles acquired a 15 per cent stake in QIW, a Queensland
grocery group, helping to thwart a hostile take over attempt by Davids
Holdings. The Trade Practices Commission said yesterday it would hold an
inquiry into Kmart's acquisition of Independent shares.
At its Michigan headquarters, Kmart remained tight-lipped about the share
purchase. Although the company has been putting increased emphasis on
international opportunities recently, and purchased stores in the Czech
Republic and Slovakia last year, it described the Independent stake was a
'non-strategic investment'.
Kmart declined to say whether it had discussed the share purchase with Coles
Myer.
In the context of Kmart, one of the largest retailers in sales terms in the
US, the funds involved in the purchase are extremely modest. Kmart's assets
at end-January, for example, were put at almost Dollars 19bn.

   Rupert Murdoch, whose takeover bid for Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd. faces a higher offer from Robert Holmes a Court, is likely to either sweeten his bid or negotiate with Mr. Holmes a Court to divide the assets of Australia's biggest media group, analysts said. 

   Moreover, Mr. Murdoch apparently can block Mr. Holmes a Court's bid in its current form. 
Mr. Holmes a Court's bid, which is being made through his J.N. Taylor Holdings Ltd., is contingent on receiving acceptances representing 90% of Herald &amp; Weekly Times's stock. 
But Mr. Murdoch's News Corp. already holds 12% of the media concern. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Holmes a Court on Wednesday offered the equivalent of $8.58 a share, or a total of $1.32 billion, converting the Australian dollar at its current rate, for Herald &amp; Weekly Times. 
That topped an offer made earlier this month by Mr. Murdoch that at the current exchange rate is valued at $7.92 a share, or $1.19 billion. 

   Both men, who are two of Australia's best-known takeover specialists, have failed in earlier bids for the media group, Mr. Murdoch in 1979 and Mr. Holmes a Court in 1982. 

   Herald &amp; Weekly Times officials said they hadn't yet decided whether to recommend the Holmes a Court bid to shareholders. 
J.N. Taylor Holdings said its bid won't proceed unless the Herald &amp; Weekly Times board recommends it. 
It added that any material changes in the structure or assets of Herald &amp; Weekly Times would make its offer invalid. 

   The Herald &amp; Weekly Times board recommended the Murdoch bid on the day it was announced, but only on the condition that a higher offer didn't materialize. 
Officials of Mr. Murdoch's News Corp. said that they were studying the Holmes a Court offer and that it was too early to comment. 
In New York, News Corp. said it would respond in a week or two. 

   But in Australia, David Fayle, News Corp.'s company secretary, noted that the 12% stake News Corp. holds in Herald &amp; Weekly Times would prevent Mr. Holmes a Court from proceeding under the 90% requirement that his bid includes, unless News Corp. chose to tender its stock to Mr. Holmes a Court. 
Mr. Murdoch acquired the 12% stake on Dec. 12 from Industrial Equity Ltd., a New Zealand-controlled investment company. 

   If Mr. Murdoch does sweeten his bid, analysts said, he might raise it to as much as $9.24 a share. 
On the Sydney Stock Exchange Wednesday, Herald &amp; Weekly Times rose as high as $8.58 -- matching Mr. Holmes a Court's offer -- before closing at $8.51, up 26.4 cents on the day. 
The exchange was closed yesterday for Christmas. 

   In addition to a cash offer, the Holmes a Court bid includes two alternatives. 
Under one, Herald &amp; Weekly Times holders may exchange every four of their shares for seven J.N. Taylor Holdings 5% convertible notes. 
Under the other, they may exchange every four shares for seven J.N. Taylor Holdings convertible preference shares. 
The preference shares are convertible into ordinary shares five years after they are issued but don't carry voting rights. 

   Mr. Murdoch's bid also contains alternatives to his cash offer. 
Herald &amp; Weekly Times holders may choose to receive two News Corp. shares for every three Herald &amp; Weekly Times shares held. 
Alternatively, they can exchange every three Herald &amp; Weekly Times shares for two 5% five-year notes that are convertible into News Corp. stock. 

   Mr. Murdoch's offer marks the first time that he is willing to dilute his hold on News Corp. to make an acquisition. 
If all the Herald &amp; Weekly Times holders opted for the share portion of the offer, his stake in News Corp. would be diluted to 33% from the current 49%. 

   If Mr. Murdoch's takeover succeeds, he will control about 75% of daily newspaper circulation in Australia and, if regulators don't intervene, will have a monopoly on daily papers in several major cities. 
Although Australia has legislation regulating broadcast holdings, including recently proposed laws prohibiting cross-ownership of broadcast and print media in the same market, it doesn't have any laws specifically governing print media ownership. 

   Under broadcasting rules, television stations can't be controlled by a foreign national. 
The Federal Court already is looking at ownership of News Corp.'s two stations in light of the Australian-born Mr. Murdoch's change to American citizenship last year to comply with U.S. media-ownership regulations. 
Mr. Murdoch also will have to sell the two Herald &amp; Weekly Times TV stations if his takeover bid is successful, because he will own newspapers in the same market. 

   By contrast, Mr. Holmes a Court's Australian media interests are modest. 
They include a weekly newspaper and a television station in Perth, another television station in Adelaide, some radio stations, and some suburban and regional papers.

   Two large Australian banks confirmed they purchased stakes in one another's stock but denied that merger talks are under way. 

   National Australia Bank Ltd. said it acquired "several parcels" of shares in rival Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., and ANZ Bank said it acquired "one package" of shares in National Australia Bank. 

   Trading in the two Melbourne-based banks' shares surged on the Australian Stock Exchange last week on merger rumors. 

   Adelaide Steamship Co., an investment company that owned an estimated 10% of ANZ, 15% of National Australia Bank and 8% of Westpac Banking Corp., recently sold some of its holdings. 

   Some analysts said those sales might have sparked the cross-buying by ANZ and National Australia Bank. 
Some analysts say they expect ANZ and National Australia Bank eventually to merge. 
There also is speculation that Sydney-based Westpac could merge with government-owned Commonwealth Banking Corp. if the government decides to sell it. 

   ANZ, National Australia Bank, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank are the four dominant banks in Australia.

   SYDNEY -- Australian Mutual Provident Society, the biggest
insurance and investment concern in Australasia, announced a
"long-term strategic alliance" with Westpac Banking Corp.
   Among the arrangements, AMP will buy Westpac Life Ltd.,
Westpac's life insurance unit. In turn, Westpac will buy the
consumer-banking business of Chase AMP Bank Ltd., a
commercial bank owned by AMP and Chase Manhattan Bank of the
U.S. The Chase Manhattan Corp. unit eventually will acquire
full ownership of Chase AMP's wholesale banking operation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Exact prices haven't been set, but preliminary indications
are that the two major elements of the agreement will involve
the payment by AMP to Westpac of 200 million Australian
dollars (US$152.2 million) for Westpac Life and the payment
by Westpac to Chase AMP of about A$30 million for Chase AMP's
consumer-banking business.
   Separately, the government declined to permit AMP to
increase its shareholding in Westpac to 15%. Australian
government regulations limit shareholdings in banks to 10%,
although the treasurer can give an exemption to go as high as
15%. AMP, a mutual concern owned by policyholders, now has a
stake of about 7% in Westpac.
   The link between AMP and Westpac is part of a trend for
Australian banks and insurance companies to form alliances
amid a tough, recessionary Australian market.

   The duel between Rupert Murdoch and Robert Holmes a Court for Australia's biggest media company, Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd., is likely to be delayed by a combination of regulators' demands and the year-end holidays. 

   Mr. Holmes a Court's Christmas Eve bid, equivalent to $8.65 a share, or a total of $1.33 billion, converting the Australian dollar at its current rate, was announced just before the nation's stock market closed for the rest of the week. 
It has triggered a fresh inquiry by the Trade Practices Commission, which has been scrutinizing the $7.98-a-share, or $1.19 billion, offer by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. earlier this month. 

   Mr. Holmes a Court is thought to be more interested in the television assets of Herald &amp; Weekly Times than its newspapers. 
Before he made the bid, he unsuccessfully approached Mr. Murdoch about buying Herald &amp; Weekly Times's TV stations. 

   Mr. Holmes a Court's bid, through his Bell Group Ltd. unit's J.N. Taylor Holdings Ltd., won't proceed unless the Herald &amp; Weekly Times board recommends it. 
The board earlier recommended the News Corp. bid, provided a higher offer didn't emerge. 

   Both bids also are conditional on 90% acceptance. 
However, Industrial Equity Ltd., a New Zealand-controlled investment concern, agreed to sell its stake of about 12% to News Corp. before Mr. Holmes a Court's bid. 
But Mr. Holmes a Court has said he might waive the 90% condition if that stake were the only obstacle to his winning the company. 

   A Herald &amp; Weekly Times spokesman said directors will meet "in due course" for the purposes of making a recommendation, "but such a meeting would be delayed by the difficulty of getting all the directors together during the holiday period." 

   The Australian Journalists Association has called for an independent inquiry into the bid for Herald &amp; Weekly Times. 
The government, however, has signaled its reluctance to intervene in the battle. 

   Although Mr. Holmes a Court's existing Australian media interests aren't as extensive as Mr. Murdoch's, they pose potential problems under the government's recently proposed restrictions on the holding of broadcast and newspaper interests in the same market. 
It is likely Mr. Holmes a Court would have to restructure the holdings of Herald &amp; Weekly Times if his bid is successful.

   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. of Australia raised its stake in Allied-Lyons PLC to 11.08% from 7%, and Allied-Lyons said Bond's intentions appear "questionable." 

   Bond, a Perth, Australia-based group that has become the world's fifth-largest brewer through acquisitions, declined to comment. 
Allied-Lyons, a big British food and drink maker, said it regarded further purchases as "unfriendly," and added that it "regrets that Bond Corp. has decided to take this action without explanation of its intentions." 

   Allied-Lyons made its announcement late yesterday. 
Its shares were quoted in late London trading at 468 pence ($7.88), up four pence. 

   The verbal jousting could signal yet another battle for control of valuable food and drink brand names. 
Alan Bond, the entrepreneur who controls about 53% of the Australian company, has said he wants Bond Corp. to be at least the No. 2 brewer in the world within five years. 

   But a takeover of Allied-Lyons would be a big bite. 
The British company is valued at #3.41 billion ($5.74 billion) at its current stock price, and the company has aggressively promoted its image and operations to the public and shareholders since Elders IXL Ltd., Bond's big Australian brewing rival, made an unsuccessful bid for Allied-Lyons in 1986. 

   Allied-Lyons also said yesterday that it had proposed "and brought close to conclusion" a joint venture with Bond -- which would be 60% owned by Allied-Lyons and 40% by the Australian company -- to buy certain Bond brands and develop their sales in Europe. 
It didn't say what Mr. Bond's response had been, or what would happen now that he had raised his holding in Allied-Lyons.

FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Westpac running out of time to
get its act together - The difficulties still facing the troubled Australian
bank after the latest upheavals

WESTPAC, Australia's biggest bank, is not known for its sense of irony. But
there must have been a few wry grins in the bank's Sydney headquarters on
Wednesday when National Australia Bank (NAB) announced it had completed
precautionary checks on the books of Bank of New Zealand.
The announcement confirmed NAB will proceed with its proposed NZDollars
1.48bn (Dollars 796m) acquisition of BNZ, which will propel it past Westpac
as Australia's biggest bank in terms of global assets. Westpac directors,
meanwhile, were wondering how many of them would have to fall on their
swords to satisfy the markets' lust for boardroom blood.
Westpac has a special place in Australian banking history as the country's
oldest bank. But it has paid a heavier price than the other leading banks
for the ill-considered dash for growth in which they indulged in the mid to
late 1980s.
Westpac's problems came to a head in May, when it wrote off ADollars 2.65bn
(Dollars 1.91bn) against bad debts, of which ADollars 2.1bn reflected a
revaluation of its ADollars 6.3bn property portfolio. The write-offs left
the bank with pre-tax losses of ADollars 2.2bn for the six months to March,
compared with profits of ADollars 313m a year earlier.
Mr Frank Conroy, managing director, expected the substantial write-off to
ease investors' fears about Westpac's exposure to corporate failures and the
weak property market. At the same time, Mr Conroy sought to strengthen the
bank's balance sheet by raising ADollars 1.2bn through a 3-for-10 rights
issue at ADollars 3 per share.
However, the rights issue merely compounded Westpac's difficulties.
Executives watched in horror as the bank's share price slid from ADollars
3.87 on the day it was announced to ADollars 2.99 on the day it closed. Not
surprisingly, the issue fell ADollars 880m short of target after investors
took up rights to only 111m of 405m shares on offer, leaving CS First Boston
and its sub-underwriters to take up the shortfall.
On a wider front, Westpac has been taking a public relations beating as
Australian newspapers and television stations have relentlessly pursued
allegations of fraud by bank officials in connection with a controversial
foreign exchange loans scheme which left many borrowers heavily indebted
after the Australian dollar collapsed in the late 1980s.
Westpac strongly denies criminal activity by any of its staff in relation to
foreign loans. But the bank has also been identified by the New South Wales
Independent Commission Against Corruption as one of a number of banks and
insurance companies which illegally trafficked in confidential government
information on customers.
Against this background, Mr Conroy admitted earlier this week that the bank
was aware of concern among institutional investors about the composition of
the board. But until mid-morning yesterday, both Mr Conroy and Sir Eric
Neal, chairman, resolutely refused to say whether resignations could be
expected.
Sir Eric, deputy chairman since 1987 and chairman since 1990, was the main
target for a dissident shareholders' group led by Mr Gavin Solomon, a Sydney
solicitor, which has gained credibility as Westpac's problems have worsened.
The group also sought the departure of Sir Neil Currie, a director since
1987 and deputy chairman since 1991, and several other long-serving
directors. However, there was no pressure for the departure of Mr Conroy.
In the event, the board surprised the markets by announcing the resignation
of five directors, a third of the total, including both Sir Eric and Sir
Neil.
Westpac shares rose 1 cent on the announcement, to close at ADollars 2.86.
However, few observers expect a significant improvement in the short term
because of the large volume of shares overhanging the market and continuing
worries about the bank's exposure to the deteriorating commercial property
market.
Mr Conroy has forecast improved profits in the second half, and conceded
that the markets will need to see at least three successive good half-year
results from Westpac before the crisis of confidence in the bank can be said
to be over. However, analysts say there is still a chance that Westpac may
be forced into further large write-offs.
Mr Scott Hawker, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in Sydney, says: 'There is a
view emerging that while Westpac was conservative in May when it made those
big write-offs, market conditions have undoubtedly deteriorated since then.
'There is at least a chance (of further major write-offs) because they will
look very bad, having said they have taken all the pain, if ANZ or another
bank comes out with further write-offs. At the least, Westpac's solid level
of provisioning will have to continue. There is little room for them to cut
back.'
Mr John Uhrig, who replaces Sir Eric as chairman, had little to say about
future strategy yesterday, preferring to concentrate his fire on the media,
which many Westpac officials blame for precipitating the crisis. Mr Uhrig
also had no answer to awkward questions about why other long-serving
directors were remaining on the board.
However, Mr Uhrig has built a solid reputation as chairman of CRA, the
largely British-owned mining group, and the consensus among analysts was
that he and Mr Conroy should be able to convince investors that enough blood
has been shed to demonstrate the board's contrition for past mistakes.
That will not be good enough for Mr Solomon, who made clear that he would
continue his campaign for a vote on the continued incumbency of all
directors at the next annual meeting, due in January. However, he is
unlikely to persuade the institutions who own most of Westpac's shares to
support a further upheaval.
The only other bright spot for Westpac is that federal government
regulations prevent any other financial institution mounting a takeover
attempt to take advantage of its weakness. But that will change if, as
expected, the conservative opposition parties win the next federal election,
due by mid-1993.
If that happens, NAB may be sorely tempted to double its asset base by
bidding for its erstwhile big brother. Which gives Westpac about a year to
get its house in order.

   Rupert Murdoch's takeover offer for Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd., Australia's biggest media group, encountered potential obstacles from another possible bidder and the Australian government. 

   Herald &amp; Weekly Times directors met with the Australian takeover specialist Robert Holmes a Court on Friday amid speculation that he would launch a counteroffer, even through the board of the Melbourne-based media group last Wednesday approved a bid, equivalent to $1.18 billion, by Mr. Murdoch's News Corp. 

   Meanwhile, the government's Trade Practices Commission said it is investigating the ramifications of a successful takeover by Mr. Murdoch, which would make News Corp. by far the largest media group in Australia. 
Bob McComas, the commission chairman, said that if the bid succeeds, Mr. Murdoch may have to sell some of his newspaper interests in the states of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. 
Mr. Murdoch has said he will sell Herald &amp; Weekly Times television stations in Melbourne and Adelaide to satisfy government regulations if his bid succeeds. 

   But the threat of an offer by Mr. Holmes a Court seems the more formidable opposition to Mr. Murdoch. 
Mr. Holmes a Court, who failed in a 1982 takeover effort for Herald &amp; Weekly Times, said the talks were preliminary and would continue. 
He wouldn't rule out a counteroffer but said he agreed with the board to keep the talks confidential. 
Mr. Holmes a Court, who is known for his long-runnning pursuit of Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's largest concern, recently sold a stake in USX Corp. of the U.S. after fueling heavy trading in the company's shares. 

   In New York, a News Corp. spokesman said, "We'd heard rumors of an impending offer and we'll have to see what our position will be if the offer materializes." 
He noted that while the Herald &amp; Weekly Times board accepted News Corp.'s bid, the acceptance was contingent on no better offer for the company coming forward. 

   In another development, the chairman of Industrial Equity Ltd., an Australian company that holds an 11.6% stake in Herald &amp; Weekly Times, said Friday that News Corp.'s offer of $7.85 a share appeared inadequate. 
Industrial Equity has also been considered a possible contender for the company. 

   Ron Brierly, Industrial Equity's chairman, said: "A bid is always an option, but we are not going to rush into an offer of that magnitude." 

   Separately, in New York, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is considering downgrading its Ba-2 ratings on two News Corp. issues, citing the bid for Herald &amp; Weekly Times. 
One issue under review is $200 million of exchangeable redeemable preference shares of Newscorp Finance N.V. 
The other is the increasing-rate exchangeable guaranteed preferred stock of Fox Television Stations Inc. 

   Moody's is examining the mix of debt and equity that would be used to make the acquisition, as well as the company's plan to sell assets for regulatory reasons. 

   Richard Sarazen, chief financial officer of News Corp., said the company believes a downgrading isn't in order. 
He noted that the purchase would be made with stock and notes convertible into News Corp. stock. 
"This transaction will be funded in the final analysis with equity, and should in fact strengthen the company rather than weaken it," he said.

   John Fairfax Ltd., attempting to establish a second television network in Australia, offered the equivalent of $239.8 million for the television interests of Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd. 

   Last month, Bond Corp. paid $666.1 million for the television operations of privately owned Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd., making it the first company to set up a network covering most major Australian cities. 

   Fairfax's offer is the second it has made to Herald, which is Australia's biggest media company, with interests in newspapers, magazines, television and radio. 
Fairfax earlier offered $1.67 billion for all of Herald, in competition with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which is offering $1.53 billion. 
News Corp. has made provisional agreements to sell Herald's television stations if its bid succeeds. 

   The separate Fairfax offer for the Herald television stations was viewed by analysts as an attempt by Fairfax to ensure that it comes out of the battle with at least some of Herald's assets. 

   The moves have been sparked in part by a proposed liberalization in government regulations that up to now have restricted a single company from owning more than two television stations. 
The government proposes instead to limit the ability of companies to own both newspaper and television operations in any major city. 
The proposals haven't been approved by parliament and might be changed before they become law. 

   Fairfax, which already owns television stations in Sydney and Brisbane as well as newspapers and magazines in several states, said it is prepared to pay $179.8 million for Herald's Melbourne television station and $59.9 million for its Adelaide station. 
As an alternative to the offer for the Adelaide station, Fairfax said it would pay $76.6 million for that station plus Herald radio operations in the states of Victoria and South Australia. 

   Herald's chairman, John Dahlsen, said after the Fairfax offer was received that the Herald board decided to call for tenders for its radio and television operations, and that an additional offer from a company he didn't identify already had been received for the Melbourne station. 

   Fairfax's group general manager, G.J. Gardiner, said the company would be prepared to reconsider its offers for the television operations if other companies make higher bids.

   Adelaide Steamship Co., an Australian investment and trading concern, joined the fight over the assets of financier Robert Holmes a Court's former corporate empire. 

   Adelaide Steamship told the Australian Stock Exchange late yesterday it has acquired an 11.4% holding in Bell Resources Ltd. through stock-market purchases. 
It didn't disclose the price it paid or the reasons for the investment, and company officials weren't available for comment. 

   Bell Resources is 43%-owned by Bell Group Ltd., Mr. Holmes a Court's former flagship that is the target of a takeover bid by Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond. 
Mr. Bond's Bond Corp. Holdings bought 19.9% of Bell Group in April and last month announced it was bidding for the rest of the company, except for a 19.9% stake held by the State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia. 
It estimated the cost of the offer at $520 million Australian dollars ($417 million). 

   Also last month, Bond Corp. disclosed plans to merge Bond Corp. and Bell Group companies to form Australia's second-biggest stock-exchange-listed company, which could control assets of more than A$11 billion (US$8.82 billion). 

   Early yesterday, Bond Corp. said it has acquired slightly more than 45% of Bell Group, mainly through stock-market purchases, and had won two seats on the Bell Group board. 

   Analysts say Adelaide Steamship Managing Director John Spalvins, one of the country's most active entrepreneurs, wants to be dealt into the split-up of Mr. Holmes a Court's assets. 

   His move conceivably could block Bond Corp.'s proposed merger with the Bell companies, analysts say. 
Speculating on possible outcomes of Mr. Spalvins's move, they say Bond Corp. might opt to buy Adelaide Steamship out of Bell Group. 
Or, Adelaide Steamship might try to negotiate to acquire some Bell Group assets, such as its 15% stake in British bank Standard Chartered PLC, or its shares in Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's biggest company, they say. 

   Bond Corp.'s plans for Bell Resources, which must be approved by shareholders in the companies, also have run into resistance among institutional investors. 
They want a cash offer rather than stock in Bond Corp. that they would get through a share-exchange proposal. 

   Kerry Packer, Australia's richest man, and Sir Ronald Brierley, a millionaire New Zealand investor, already have made a joint run at Bell Resources and been bought out by Bond Corp. at a large profit.

FT  02 OCT 92 / Westpac chairman and four directors quit after criticism

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairman and four directors of Westpac Banking Corporation, Australia's
biggest bank, resigned yesterday in the face of criticism from the markets
and financial institutions.
Sir Eric Neal, chairman, Sir Neil Currie, deputy chairman, and three other
long-serving directors had accepted responsibility for heavy losses and bad
debts which had halved the bank's share price.
Westpac's problems came to a head last week when a ADollars 1.2bn (Pounds
488m) rights issue closed 72 per cent undersubscribed, forcing the
underwriters to take up shares worth about ADollars 860m. This followed a
disastrous first half in which the bank incurred pre-tax losses of ADollars
2.2bn after writing off ADollars 2.65bn against bad debts, including a
ADollars 2.1bn write-down of its property portfolio.
Westpac said Sir Eric would be replaced by Mr John Uhrig, chairman of CRA,
the mining group 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK. Sir James Balderstone,
chairman of the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution, was
appointed deputy chairman.
None of the departing directors was available for comment. Mr Uhrig said
they had resigned voluntarily 'on the basis of the need to demonstrate board
responsibility'. He would not comment on why a number of other long serving
directors had not resigned.
Mr Uhrig said there would be no immediate change in the bank's strategy of
cutting costs, improving efficiency and resuscitating its battered public
image.
Analysts said the resignations would help stimulate market support for
Westpac's shares, which have collapsed from ADollars 3.87 in August to less
than ADollars 3, about half the level of two years ago.
Westpac has suffered deteriorating losses for the last two years as falling
asset prices have exposed the poor quality of many loans and property
investments made during a period of rapid expansion in the late 1980s.
The mass resignation follows strong private pressure for tough action from
institutional investors, and a campaign against the bank by dissident
shareholders and much of the media.
The Australian Financial Review yesterday called for the resignation of the
entire board.
Westpac shares closed one cent higher at ADollars 2.86 on the Australian
Stock Exchange.

FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Foster's wooed in ADollars 5.7bn
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<TEXT>
SA BREWING, the Australian drinks and manufacturing group, yesterday
proposed an ADollars 5.7bn (USDollars 4.3bn) merger with Foster's Brewing,
the brewing, pastoral and finance group formerly controlled by Mr John
Elliott.
The merger would create Australia's fifth biggest company, and largely
resolve the financial problems of Mr Elliott's International Brewing
Holdings (IBH), a private company which owns 38 per cent of Foster's.
Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing chief executive, said he had 'initiated and
developed' the proposal, which is conditional on the appointment of SA
Brewing nominees as chairman and chief executive of the merged group.
However, the merger also forms the central element of a debt rescheduling
plan presented yesterday by IBH to its banks. IBH has debts of about
ADollars 2.5bn, acquired to finance the purchase of Foster's shares now
worth ADollars 1.6bn.
The board of Foster's said it would consider the offer, but is almost
certain to reject it. The board is understood to have turned down a similar
approach from SA Brewing in March.
The offer will also face scrutiny by the Trade Practices Commission, which
indicated that it was concerned about the possibility of a further reduction
of competition in the highly concentrated beer market.
The plan provides for a new holding company to issue one share for each SA
Brewing share, and one for each 1.5 shares in Foster's. There would be no
cash alternative.
The offer values Foster's shares at a premium of three cents to last night's
closing price of ADollars 1.90. SA Brewing shares would be worth ADollars
2.90, compared to the market price of ADollars 3.07.
However, SA Brewing believes the deal would unlock substantial extra value
for shareholders by removing the uncertainty about IBH's financial position,
which has depressed Foster's share price for the last two years.
This would be achieved through the reduction of the IBH stake in the merged
company from an initial 28 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
IBH would exchange its rights to about 14.5 per cent of the merged group for
perpetual convertible notes, exchangeable for shares after two years. The
merged group would then underwrite the sale by IBH of about 6 per of its
remaining holding.
If its bankers approve, the deal would provide IBH with about ADollars 345m
in cash for immediate payment of overdue interest, and allow it to secure
the bulk of its debt against the convertible notes and remaining shares. IBH
would also gain a reliable stream of dividend and interest payments.
SA Brewing said the 'significant financial strength' of the merged group
would provide 'substantial benefits' to shareholders of both companies. Mr
Wilson said the deal was expected to take at least five months to conclude.
The merger is dependent on the approval of the directors and shareholders of
both companies, and the creditors of IBH, led by Hongkong Bank Australia,
Citibank, and BHP, Australia's biggest company.
SA Brewing is a diversified Adelaide-based company, which dominates the
south Australian beer market, and has substantial interests in home
appliances and packaging.
Foster's, Australia's biggest brewer, owns Courage in the UK and half of
Molson Breweries in Canada.
The group has been in turmoil since losing a record ADollars 1.3bn in
1989/90, largely as a result of write-offs connected with non-brewing
activities acquired during Mr Elliott's reign as chairman and chief
executive.
The group has since sought to refocus itself as a pure brewing operation,
but has been unable to dispose of non-core assets worth about ADollars
2.8bn. The board warned last week it may be forced to write-down the value
of non-core assets again this year, which could affect its ability to pay a
dividend.

   The global stock-market crash could be pushing Australia's richest man, international takeover artist Robert Holmes a Court, into a cash bind. 
Despite his troubles, though, the usually tight-lipped Mr. Holmes a Court is hinting he is more inclined to buy than sell. 

   The price collapse has slashed hundreds of millions of dollars off the market capitalization of Mr. Holmes a Court's major listed companies, Bell Group Ltd. and Bell Resources Ltd. 
An announcement early last week that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. was withdrawing as lead manager of a one billion-Australian-dollar ($679 million) bond issue for Bell Resources, which was to have reduced the company's interest bill, has further shaken investor confidence. 

   Though prices of both Bell companies recovered slightly this week in a stronger Australian stock market, the two are significantly below their 1987 peaks. 
Moreover, prices have fallen far more than the market average and than several other high-flying entrepreneurial stocks. 
Alan Bond's Bond Corp., John Elliott's Elders IXL Ltd., Australian-born Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Larry Adler's FAI Insurances Ltd., for instance, haven't been hit nearly as hard. 

   Mr. Holmes a Court, who earlier this year became Australia's first billionaire, has watched his personal wealth sag; some estimates put his paper losses at more than $600 million. 

   Mr. Holmes a Court controls about 45% of Bell Group, which, in turn, owns 42.5% of Bell Resources. 
Bell Group closed yesterday at 3.05 Australian dollars, down 73% from its 1987 peak of 11.30 dollars. 
Since Oct. 19, when the world stock crash began, the price of Bell Group stock has plunged 69%, nearly twice as fast as the 36% decline in the All Ordinaries index. 

   Bell Resources shares have also tumbled, closing yesterday at 1.67 dollars -- 79% below the year's high of eight dollars and 67% below on its pre-crash price. 

   Investor speculation has focused on Bell Resources, and its biggest assets -- a 30% stake in Broken Hill Proprietary Co. and 10% in Texaco Inc. (BHP is Australia's biggest company in terms of market capitalization; the big U.S. oil concern is currently in bankruptcy proceedings.) 

   Because many of Bell Resources' assets are stakes in other listed companies, which provide dividends but no access to cash flow, investors are speculating that the Great Acquirer, as Mr. Holmes a Court is known, is heading for a cash squeeze in 1988. 
"The group is asset-rich but isn't obtaining a high operating cash flow from its assets," said John Bartley, an analyst at Potter Partners, a Melbourne-based brokerage. 

   While Bell Resources' 1987 pretax earnings of about 400 million dollars should be enough to cover this year's interest bill, which some analysts expect to exceed 200 million dollars on debt of more than 3.6 billion dollars, next year could tell a different story. 
If share prices remain depressed, profits from stock-trading operations -- a big contributor to earnings -- aren't likely to be as buoyant. 
That is putting pressure on Mr. Holmes a Court either to reduce his debt load through sales of assets or to acquire a cash cow. 

   Ian Story, an analyst at BZW Meares in Sydney, estimated Bell Resources' 1988 interest bill at 300 million dollars and the company's earnings, based on its current structure without any share-trading profits, at 248 million dollars. 
He said the proposed Merrill Lynch bond issue would have trimmed the 1988 interest bill by about 80 million dollars before tax. 

   Despite all this, Mr. Holmes a Court has indicated he will use his ample access to credit to shop around for yet more acquisitions. 
In the just-released Bell Group annual report, written after the Oct. 19 crash, he seeks to reassure shareholders that he is still on the prowl. 
Bell has "held substantial lines of credit in place over the last 12 months which will allow us to actively pursue our goals," he says. 

   Already, rumors are swirling in the stock market about what Mr. Holmes a Court may go after next. 
Speculation is that Bell Group, whose holdings include media, gold and insurance interests, will seek the rest of Pioneer Concrete Services Ltd., an Australian building-products and resources group in which Bell acquired a 17% interest in August. 
A cash bid probably would have to be made at four dollars a share and would cost Bell Group about two billion dollars. 

   As for Bell Resources, some analysts think it unlikely Mr. Holmes a Court will put up the eight billion dollars needed to acquire the remaining shares. 

   Abroad, BZW Meares's Mr. Story said Mr. Holmes a Court may shed some British holdings. 
Bell Group's 15% stake in Standard Chartered PLC may be put on the block, providing Mr. Holmes a Court could recoup his investment, originally 340 million dollars. 

   But he might bid for the British retailer Sears PLC -- paying an estimated three billion dollars to acquire the 92% he doesn't already own -- and sell Sears's low-yielding property interests, some analysts said. 
A full bid for Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, the British investment bank, could also be in the wings. 
Mr. Story also said Mr. Holmes a Court might be looking for a buyer for his Texaco stake, though he doesn't think the Australian investor would take a loss. 
He paid an average $37 a share; Texaco fell $3.25 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday to close at $31, one day after the Texas Supreme Court affirmed Pennzoil Co.'s $10.3 billion judgment against the company. 

   Those who have been on the other side of transactions with Mr. Holmes a Court, however, warn of red herrings. 
"The only thing predictable about Robert is when he's normally trying to indicate one thing, he's going to do another," said an investment banker.

FT  05 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Australian bulls pay for misplaced
hopes - The economy let them down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been a good year for bulls in Australia. Time and again, brokers
have forecast a sustained rally, only to retreat hurriedly as the All
Ordinaries index resumed its downward trend.
At yesterday's close of 1,435.2, the index was 13.1 per cent lower than at
the end of last year, and down more than 37 per cent since the all-time high
of 2,300 in October 1987.
The bulls have reason to feel hard done by. Most of the misplaced optimism
was based on slowly improving economic fundamentals following Australia's
emergence from recession in the last quarter of 1991.
As the federal government keeps pointing out, Australia's economic cycle is
ahead of most of the rest of the world, and its annualised GDP growth rate
of 2.1 per cent is now one of the fastest in the OECD.
But the market has remained stubbornly unmoved, in spite of three cuts in
official interest rates and a substantial fiscal boost delivered in two
expansionary economic statements earlier this year.
With the benefit of hindsight, the lack of response suggests that the market
had fully discounted the prospects of a return to economic growth by the end
of last year.
Investors may have been disappointed by the slower-than-forecast pace of
recovery, and disturbed by the signs of impending currency and current
account difficulties which have accompanied it.
They may also have been put off by the sea of red ink which has spilled from
the books of most of Australia's big companies as the impact of the 18-month
recession works its way through the accounts.
Hardly a corner of the economy has emerged unscathed. Of the 24 sectoral
indices quoted by the Australian Stock Exchange, only three are higher than
at the end of last year. And two of those - chemicals and property trusts -
have barely moved.
The only real success story has been the media index, which is up more than
50 per cent, mainly because of a spectacular improvement in the share price
of News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, film and broadcasting
group.
The media index has also been helped by the performance of John Fairfax, the
newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group, and
Nine Network, the television group controlled by Mr Kerry Packer.
Significantly all three groups are recovering from earlier reverses.
However, the media index makes up only about 9 per cent of the All
Ordinaries index, and its performance has been overshadowed by the collapse
elsewhere in the market.
The gold index is down more than 11 per cent, diversified resources 26 per
cent, developers and contractors 26 per cent, building materials 23 per
cent, transport 23 per cent, banking and finance 25 per cent, and alcohol
and tobacco 37 per cent.
There are some hopeful signs for the future. The Australian dollar has
declined by more than 13 per cent this year on a trade weighted basis, which
makes local stocks cheaper for overseas buyers.
Corporate net profits increased by 26 per cent in the three months to the
end of September, to a level 37 per cent above the low point of the
recession in mid-1990.
However, earnings before interest, tax and depreciation rose by only 6.4 per
cent, suggesting that most of the improvement in net profits flowed from
lower interest rates and cost cutting, rather than higher sales or margins.
Apart from the media groups, few major companies made an unambiguous return
to the good financial health in the full-year reporting season which ended
last month.
Exceptions included Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest company;
Amcor, the packaging and paper group; CSR, the sugar and building materials
producer; and Mayne Nickless, the transport, security and health group.
But many big companies continued to disappoint, including TNT and Brambles,
the transport groups; the miners CRA and North Broken Hill Peko; Goodman
Fielder Wattie, Australasia's largest food producer; and Pacific Dunlop, the
diversified manufacturer.
Worst of all, the banking sector is still showing the strains of recession
and falling property prices. The conservatively-managed National Australia
Bank produced an improvement, but Commonwealth, Westpac and ANZ all reported
disappointing or disastrous results.
The market was also badly hit in October by Westpac's ADollars 1.2bn
fully-underwritten rights issue, which closed 72 per cent undersubscribed,
leaving millions of unwanted shares overhanging the market.
In the absence of an unexpected acceleration of economic recovery, the
market is likely to mark time over the next few months in the hope of
improved results in the interim reporting season beginning in February.
The more optimistic bulls are still forecasting the long-delayed rally,
which some claim could take the index to 1,800 by the middle of next year.
But nervous investors should be aware that bears are tipping a floor of
1,250 before a sustained recovery begins.

NATIONAL Australia Bank, one of Australia's four major national trading
banks, has reversed two years of falling earnings to achieve a 12.3 per cent
increase in net profits to ADollars 405.6m (USDollars 307.2m) for the six
months ended March, 1992.
The Melbourne-based group, which is holding its interim dividend at 22 cents
a share, says doubtful debt charges fell from ADollars 455.7m to ADollars
412.6m.
Mr Don Argus managing director, points to 'some tentative signs of economic
recovery'.
National's report was in marked contrast to Wednesday's half-year results
from Westpac, Australia's biggest trading bank, which declared a ADollars
1.67bn loss following huge property portfolio write-offs.
The major point of contrast was the performance of the two banks' finance
offshoots. National's Custom Credit turned a ADollars 68.7m loss into a
ADollars 6.4m profit, but Westpac's Australian Guarantee Corporation
incurred a ADollars 719m loss, mainly as a result of property exposure.
National's UK and Irish banking operations acted as the main brake on
earnings with a contribution declining by almost 28 per cent to ADollars
120.1m. The operations include the Clydesdale, Northern Yorkshire and
National Irish groups.
National's Australian trading and savings banks incurred a modest 0.3 per
cent earnings fall to ADollars 279.8m following a 3.1 per cent rise in bad
loan charges to ADollars 212.1m.
The UK and Irish banks bore the brunt of the bad loans with write-offs
rising from ADollars 97.5m to ADollars 201.4m. The biggest contributor was
Yorkshire Bank where charges jumped from ADollars 62.9m to ADollars 156.2m.
The most tangible sign of pessimism in National's result was an increase in
problem loan provisions from ADollars 3.86bn to ADollars 4.25bn on the
widest definition.
But Mr Argus did address the matter of property valuations in the wake of
the Westpac shock. He said the continued decline in property values in
Australia remained a major influence on the group's provisioning and
write-offs.
Mr Argus indicated that National's Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 7.9 per
cent at March, against a reserve bank minimum requirement of 4 per cent.

National Australia Bank and Westpac, two of Australia's largest commercial
banks, yesterday reported interim figures which emphasised the continuing
improvement in bad debt experience. They also demonstrated some pick-up in
the business lending market.
NAB, reckoned to be the strongest of Australia's big four banks, announced a
profit of ADollars 868.8m (USDollars 634.2m) after tax for the six months
until the end of March. This included a ADollars 63.8m abnormal item
relating to a disposal, but still represented a sharp increase on last
time's ADollars 507.3m, which also included a ADollars 32.9m abnormal
surplus.
NAB attributed the improvement to a higher level of business loan demand in
Australia and New Zealand, a decline in operating expenses, and a further
'significant' reduction in the charge for bad and doubtful debts.
The two biggest geographical divisions - Australian operations and
businesses in the UK and Ireland (which include the Clydesdale, Northern,
Yorkshire and National Irish banks) - posted net profits of ADollars 509.9m,
against ADollars 325.9m last time, and ADollars 233.6m against ADollars
157.2m, respectively. The New Zealand group made ADollars 37.9m.
Westpac reported a ADollars 320.9m profit after tax, against a loss of
ADollars 204.6m a year earlier. In its case, the drop in the bad and
doubtful debts charge was more marked, although the figure remains much
higher than at NAB. The charge in the half-year was ADollars 379m compared
with ADollars 799.7m.
Westpac's gross problem assets stood at ADollars 5.5bn at the end of March,
compared with ADollars 8.57bn a year earlier.
Westpac said restructuring at the bank had helped to push its expense/income
ratio down to 60 per cent in the six months. It said it was 'well-placed' to
achieve its target of 58 per cent in the 1995 financial year.
Westpac is increasing the interim dividend by 33 per cent to 8 cents a
share. NAB has declared a full-franked interim dividend of 35 cents a share,
up from 24 cents.

FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: ConsPress takes 8.27% stake in
Westpac Banking

CONSOLIDATED Press Holdings (ConsPress), Mr Kerry Packer's privately-owned
publishing group, yesterday emerged as the buyer of an 8.27 per cent stake
in Westpac Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank.
The shareholding, worth ADollars 434m (USDollars 299.3m) at last night's
closing price of ADollars 2.99, is close to the 10 per cent ceiling placed
on individual shareholdings by Westpac's deed of settlement and federal
banking law. ConsPress could move to 15 per cent ownership of Westpac, but
only with the approval of both the board and Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer
(finance minister).
Mr Packer, who is travelling abroad, was not available for comment. Mr Al
Dunlap, managing director of ConsPress, said Westpac was 'a very good
company, with great potential'. Mr John Uhrig, Westpac chairman, said the
bank was very pleased to have Mr Packer as a shareholder. He said the
ConsPress holding would add stability to the share register.
Mr Packer was also welcomed by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest
financial institution, which owns 15 per cent of Westpac. Mr Ian Salmon,
managing director, said Westpac was 'a strong company with an excellent
future, and it is pleasing that Mr Packer shares that view'.
ConsPress said it had acquired the rights to 145.16m Westpac shares since it
began buying in mid-October. The stake comprises 4.61 per cent of Westpac's
ordinary shares and 3.66 per cent in the form of options.
Buying by ConsPress pushed Westpac shares briefly above ADollars 3
yesterday, for the first time in two months. The shares fell back in later
trading to close 1 cent higher on the day.
ConsPress has been rumoured to be acquiring Westpac shares since the failure
in October of the bank's ADollars 1.72bn rights issue. The issue closed 72
per cent undersubscribed, leaving many sub-underwriters holding unwanted
shares.
Analysts said Mr Packer's investment was likely to provide a significant
lift for the shares, which fell to a low of about ADollars 2.65 last week
after the group announced a record net loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year
to September. The shares were trading at about ADollars 4.50 at the start of
the year.
ConsPress gave no indication of its motives in buying Westpac shares.
Analysts said Mr Packer would probably seek a seat on the board, but would
be prevented from seeking control by the law and the bank's deed of
settlement.
Mr Packer may be counting on a takeover bid for Westpac by one of the other
three Australian banks, National Australia Bank (NAB), Australia and New
Zealand banking Group (ANZ) and Commonwealth Bank.
The banks are excluded from the legal restriction on bank shareholdings, but
are prevented from bidding for each other by a separate government policy
which bans mergers between the six largest financial institutions.

   Police said today they found nearly 100
pounds of heroin in the water tanks of a yacht and broke up a Hong
Kong-based drug ring by employing police officers as crew members.
Authorities said it was Australia's biggest heroin bust.
   In simultaneous raids overnight Friday, police arrested 21
people in Sydney and Hong Kong and seized 96 pounds of high-grade
Thai heroin with an estimated street value of $40 million.
   Seven people were arrested in Sydney and 14 others in raids on
60 premises in Hong Kong, Detective Inspector Cliff Foster said.
   In the ruse, two police officers were able to get jobs as crew
members aboard a 50-foot ketch that authorities suspected was being
used to ferry drugs, said Detective Inspector Mike Howard of the
Royal Hong Kong Police Force Drug Squad.
   Foster said the probe began in June after authorities were
tipped off that a large quantity of heroin was en route from Hong
Kong to Australia.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Westpac Banking Corp., as part of a
strategic alliance formed last year, said it will allot
Australian Mutual Provident Society 73,146,000 new Westpac
common shares.
   The move will expand AMP's share in Westpac to about 15%
from 10%. The allotment to AMP, Australia's biggest insurance
and investment concern, is valued at A$4.13 (US$3.09) a
share, or A$302 million for the entire parcel. The allotment
is expected to be completed in about two weeks.

<TEXT>
   In trading yesterday on the Australian Stock Exchange,
Westpac shares rose four Australian cents to A$4.22.
   Australian regulations limit shareholdings in banks to
10%, unless the treasurer makes a concession, which he did in
the case of the strategic alliance. However, Treasurer John
Dawkins ruled yesterday that Westpac and AMP may hold
combined stakes of only as much as 10% in other banks. He
said the two organizations must reduce their combined
shareholdings in other banks within six months.
   Advance Bank Australia Ltd. had sought clarification on
the 10% limit in the case of Westpac and AMP. Earlier this
week, Advance Bank said the two have a combined shareholding
of 15.9% of its ordinary shares.

   CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia is producing nearly 90%
of its oil needs and, despite the Middle East conflict, is
"well placed" to meet its requirements, the government said.
   Alan Griffiths, minister for resources, said Australia's
oil self-sufficiency rate is up from 65% in 1983, when the
Labor Party government took office. He contended that
government deregulation of crude-oil marketing and strategies
to increase exploration have helped improve self-sufficiency.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Production from Australia's biggest fields in Bass Strait
is declining, while output from northern offshore fields is
rising. Australia imports some oil, but overall is a net
exporter of energy, because it is the world's biggest coal
exporter and sells liquefied natural gas, uranium and
light-crude oil.
   The price of domestically produced crude is kept close to
international levels. Mr. Griffiths said Australia can't
artificially restrict prices for crude, because such controls
would cause producers to export more crude, reduce
exploration and force up oil imports.
   But Canberra has insisted that oil companies slow the rise
in retail prices of gasoline since the Gulf conflict boosted
world prices. Yet gasoline prices could rise four Australian
cents a liter next week, the Service Station Association
said. Gasoline already costs more than 80 cents (66 U.S.
cents) a liter in some parts of the country. A liter is equal
to 0.26 gallon.
   Mr. Griffiths said Australia has relatively low taxes on
gasoline, and cited data showing Australian gasoline users
have been paying about 74 Australian cents a liter, compared
with the equivalent of 1.62 Australian dollars (US$1.34) in
Italy and A$1.31 in France.

FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Takeover drive puts TNT on road
to profit - The Australian transport group is winning back investors'
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Peter Abeles, chief executive of TNT, the Australian transport and
express mail group, has a message to the markets: after a year of hectic
deal-making, the group has sorted out its problems and is on track for a
return to profit.
Sir Peter, 68, flew back to TNT's Sydney headquarters from Europe this week
with three deals in his pocket. He believes these will put an end to
investors' concerns about the group's profitability and liquidity.
He also made clear his intention to go on managing the company, which he
transformed during the 1970s and 1980s from a small haulier into an
international shipping, aviation and trucking conglomerate.
'I have no plans to retire; I have not got time for it,' he said in response
to rumours that he intended to hand over management to one of TNT's younger
executives.
Under Sir Peter's guidance, TNT expanded rapidly through the 1980s, from
revenues of ADollars 1.7bn (USDollars 1.29bn) in 1984 to ADollars 4.5bn in
1990. At their peak, the shares were worth well over ADollars 4 on the
Australian Stock Exchange.
However, the group ran into trouble early last year when institutional
investors began to worry about the high level of debt incurred to finance
growth.
With bank debt and subordinated loans totalling ADollars 2.2bn, compared
with shareholders' funds of ADollars 1.1bn, TNT looked vulnerable to the
growing recession in its main markets in Australia, the US and the UK.
There were also worries about the group's entrepreneurial nature and its
close relationship with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which was then
struggling to cope with severe financial problems.
Like Mr Murdoch, Sir Peter had shown himself willing to take big risks. In
the UK, for example, TNT's big breakthrough came when its trucks carried Mr
Murdoch's newspapers through the picket lines at News Corp's non-union
printing plant in London's Docklands.
Sir Peter has also been noted for dramatic moves into new markets, usually
in an attempt to establish domination as a precursor to improving margins
through economies of scale.
In one spectacular deal, he bought five years' production of the British
Aerospace 146 Quiet Trader, amounting to 72 aircraft at about ADollars 30m
each. Only 24 were destined for TNT's own transport activities - the rest
were to be leased to other users.
Investors were also specifically concerned about Ansett Transport
Industries, which runs Australia's biggest domestic airline, and Ansett
Worldwide Aviation Services, an aircraft leasing company.
The Ansett companies are jointly owned by TNT and News Corp, and both looked
likely to suffer falling revenue as the recession and an over-supply of
aircraft reduced demand.
Concern about the group was triggered by declining profits in 1989 and 1990
as European losses and the onset of recession squeezed margins. But it was
not until the shares fell to a low of 75 cents in January last year that the
board reassesed its growth strategy.
Since then, TNT has simplified its structure by refocusing on its three core
areas of international express, domestic express, and commercial
distribution.
It has sold holdings in non-core businesses such as Foster's Brewing Group
and Normandy Poseidon, the Australian resources group, and substantially
allayed fears about the exposure of the Ansett companies.
The group made a net loss of ADollars 197m in the 12 months to June 1991 and
a further ADollars 51m loss in the six months to appears to be over, and
investors have begun buying the stock again, propelling it to nearly
ADollars 2 in recent trading.
The key to TNT's revived confidence is four big deals, three of which were
concluded last week. The deals are:
The flotation of 70 per cent of TNT Freightways, the group's US trucking
business, to raise ADollars 400m;
The acquisition of Chronoservice, a leading French express carrier, which
fills a gap in TNT's network of domestic express businesses in Europe;
A sub-contracting agreement with Federal Express, the US carrier, for the
delivery of inbound packages to 10 European countries;
The setting up of GD Net, a Dutch-based joint venture which will merge the
express mail and parcel activities of TNT and the post offices of Sweden,
the Netherlands, France, Germany and Canada.
The FedEx deal, which cost less than USDollars 18m, removes a big competitor
from the European market and gives TNT access to additional revenues of up
to USDollars 100m, although the group says it does not expect to retain the
whole of FedEx's business.
However, the most significant deal is the formation of GD Net, which is
expected to generate additional revenue of USDollars 120m in the first year.
That will, in 1992-1993, help propel the European business into profits for
the first time.
In addition, the deal allows TNT to remove ADollars 600m in long-term debt
from its balance sheet, helping reduce the ratio of long-term debt to
shareholders' equity to about 1.3 or 1.4 to 1 from from 2.2:1 in 1990.
'We are on the way to a 1:1 debt to equity ratio by 1993. The majority of it
has been done, and there is no question but that we will meet that target.
Our debt has come down tremendously,' Sir Peter said.
TNT puts much blame for the group's problems on the 'unsophisticated'
Australian market, which executives believe failed to understand the express
business.
'The way we were perceived in Australia had a major impact on us overseas -
the post office deal nearly collapsed three times because of the perception
which built up, and other deals were also affected,' Sir Peter said. 'It did
not matter how many times we said we could pay our bills, people just did
not believe it.'
TNT says it sees no indications that the recession in its main markets is
easing, but hopes for a rapid return to profitability once the European
international activities move out of losses. 'That will remove the biggest
drag on our profits,' Sir Peter said.
He refused to say when profits might return to the record level of ADollars
274m, achieved in 1988. But he suggested the improvement might be more rapid
than expected. 'We don't want to wait five years. We want to do it fast,' he
said.

   CANBERRA -- Commonwealth Bank Corp. of Australia,
currently 100% owned by the federal government, will issue
shares to selected investors and use the funds to acquire
State Bank of Victoria, the government announced.
   It said the acquisition of State Bank of Victoria for 1.6
billion Australian dollars (US$1.33 billion) will make
Commonwealth Bank the third-biggest in Australia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   State Bank of Victoria, which is owned by the Victoria
state government, was offered for sale because its investment
banking unit, Tricontinental Holdings Ltd., incurred losses
and huge bad debts over recent years. The state government
couldn't afford to cover the losses and settle
Tricontinental's debts without selling the bank.
   Commonwealth Bank's acquisition doesn't include
Tricontinental.
   Paul Keating, Australia's treasurer, said State Bank of
Victoria's debt of A$2.7 billion would have extinguished its
entire capital base of $A1.6 billion. That could have had
implications for the stability of Australia's financial
system unless State Bank of Victoria was acquired by a
stronger bank, he suggested at a news conference.
   Mr. Keating took the opportunity presented by the bank's
problem to pursue his aim of selling at least parts of
government businesses to reduce public-sector debt. Partial
privatization of government businesses is supported by some
members of the ruling Labor Party, including Mr. Keating and
Prime Minister Bob Hawke, but bitterly opposed by the party's
left-wing faction, in particular.
   Labor Party officials already had called a meeting for
Sept. 24 to decide whether the government can privatize parts
of its telecommunications concerns and airlines, which need
capital injections.
   Mr. Keating said Sunday that Commonwealth Bank "cannot
finance the acquisition from its existing capital base, and
the (federal) government isn't in a position to augment that
capital base from its budget.
   "Therefore, the equity base of Commonwealth Bank will need
to be augmented with private capital roughly equivalent to
about 30% of the Commonwealth Bank's existing capital base,"
he said.
   The federal government will retain control of Commonwealth
Bank. Australian investment institutions such as pension
funds are likely to invest in Commonwealth Bank, but other
banks can't buy shares in the bank.
   Mr. Keating said the acquisition doesn't have any
implications for the federal government's budget, announced
last week, or the overall public-sector borrowing requirement
that he plans to keep in balance this fiscal year ending June
30, 1991.
   The Victoria state government, also run by the Labor
Party, was under pressure from its members to sell State Bank
only to government-controlled Commonwealth Bank, rather than
to an investor-controlled institution. The state government
rejected a slightly higher offer for State Bank from Westpac
Banking Corp., contending that the Commonwealth Bank offer
was better because it includes certain federal tax benefits
for the state.
   Don Sanders, managing director of Commonwealth Bank, said
the merger "will create the strongest financial-services
group in Australia."
   The move wouldn't be possible without the federal
government's giving the bank the ability to issue equity
capital, Mr. Sanders said in a statement.
   The federal government will maintain its guarantee of
Commonwealth Bank's liabilities, including deposits. The
acquisition is subject to due-diligence checks by
Commonwealth Bank, as well as government and central bank
approvals and certain legislation.
   Commonwealth Bank's most-recent published accounts for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1989 show total assets at A$60.66
billion and group capital and reserves totaling A$3.98
billion. Operating profit after tax rose 74% to A$475.9
million from A$273.4 million.
   State Bank of Victoria dominates retail banking in that
state, Australia's second-biggest, so the acquisition greatly
strengthens Commonwealth Bank's competitive position in
Victoria. Indeed, State Bank is the fifth-biggest bank in the
country, with more than 500 branches and A$24 billion of
assets.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Management: Boardroom imports down under - A wave of
American executive appointments in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia has often been called the 51st state - a lighthearted reference to
the proliferation of Hollywood films, fast-food restaurants and baseball
caps. But now, at a rather more fundamental level, is American management
culture infiltrating Australian boardrooms?
The thought has been prompted by a spate of top executive appointments at
some of Australia's biggest companies. Last month, for example, the
Australian Mutual Provident, the nation's largest life insurer and a pillar
of its institutional investment community, named George Trumbull as its new
chief executive. Trumbull comes to the AMP from Cigna, the giant
Philadelphia-based insurer, where he was president of the individual
financial services division and former investment chief.
Last year Bob Joss, a former Wells Fargo executive, was appointed to head
Westpac, the oldest of Australia's 'big four' commercial banks. In 1992,
Telecom, the large state-owned telecommunications company, recruited Frank
Blount from AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, as chief executive.
This importation has seeped down to lower management levels, too. Last
month, for example, Coles Myer, one of Australia's biggest retailers,
appointed Dennis Eck to run its supermarkets division. Eck is a former
executive vice-president of American Stores and, more recently, worked for
California-based Vons Supermarkets.
But despite these eye-catching moves, executive search firms and management
consultants remain divided about how pervasive the importation of US talent
actually is. Geoff Morgan, at Morgan &amp; Banks, the executive recruitment
specialist, describes the development as 'a definite trend', pointing out
that the Trumbull/Joss/Blount appointments were all the results of
full-blown searches conducted outside Australia.
He thinks the pattern stems partly from a desire for the general management
skills and objectivity which US executives can offer, and partly from the
need for sector-specific experience. The latter element, he predicts, will
mean that the influx continues, especially in service industries where
'Australian companies don't have a great reputation', and in high-tech
fields.
This view seems well supported by Coles: it lists four specific skills where
it reckoned Eck had an edge, ranging from inventory management to
technological expertise, especially in supplier relationships. The
Australian retailer notes, too, that it has a major refurbishment programme
getting under way, and that Eck has handled more than 1,000 store overhauls.
But David Benn, managing director of consultants Korn/Ferry in Sydney -
whose strong American accent belies 20 years in Australia - reckons that the
development 'is not nearly as pervasive as the headline-grabbing stuff
suggests'.
For the most part, he suggests, US executives are being used as
trouble-shooters. 'I don't think anyone has had the brief: 'Go find an
American'. It (such appointments) tends to happen in situations where there
is a well-defined problem, and all other bets are off,' he says.
Telecom, he points out, was (and is) facing the loss of its protected
monopoly position. Westpac, having called itself Australia's world bank, had
strayed badly at home and shareholder disgruntlement was swelling.
Australia's insurance sector faces major issues like the merits of
demutualisation and increased competition.
But at least some board directors, who have the formal say over such
appointments, seem to have been wooed by the promise of broad management
objectivity. One AMP director notes that the insurer did first consider an
internal promotion, but eventually shortlisted two candidates from outside
Australia. 'We decided it was better to select someone who was unencumbered
by AMP baggage', he says.
So if these are the expectations, are they realistic? Where US executives
have already been installed, there are some clear signs that international
perspective has quickly come into play.
Most of the recent US appointments, for example, have put a major emphasis
on raising service levels. Joss wants the bank to take McDonald's as its
management model, and emulate the US hamburger chain's route to consistent
quality. Reaching such a target, he has acknowledged, implies a strong
training focus. He has also stressed the need for a more targeted rewarding
of performance.
Meanwhile, Telecom, which remains state-owned and therefore hugely
political, says that greater use is now being made of techniques like
international 'benchmarking', especially in finance.
But there also are some signs that cultural differences - notably,
Australia's strong egalitarian beliefs - may not make for the easiest
transition of ideas. Already, executive remuneration is in the spotlight,
and the packages offered to the new breed of executives - whether
home-grown, like Tony Berg at Boral, or imported, like Joss - have been
much-debated.
On the plus side, institutional shareholders, anxious to lift their profile
in the wake of the 1980s 'entrepreneurial' excesses, say they are
supportive, provided the structure of an option package is 'appropriate'.
The Australian Investment Managers Group is currently drawing up guidelines
on the subject and on corporate governance matters generally.
The throwaway remark of one mining industry manager, asked about a recent
non-Australian appointment in his own company, seems to summarise the
attitudes which the stepped-up executive culture has yet to alter. 'We
haven't caught the Bob Joss syndrome if that's what you mean,' he comments.
'My family has been shareholders of Westpac for years and all I can say is
he'd better be worth it.'

FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese win coal price cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN COAL exporters have been forced, for the second year in
succession, to accept a price cut for steam coal shipments to Japan. The new
price - for deliveries in the 1992-1993 financial year - is USDollars 38.90
a tonne, fob Australia, 95 cents down from the current year.
Australia is the key supplier of both steam coal, largely used for
electricity generation, as well as coking coal for the Japanese steel mills.
The contract was set up by Chubu Electric Power, the lead negotiator for the
Japanese utilities, with the Queensland coal producer MIM and Ulan and
Drayton of New South Wales. While the Australians may express some
disappointment with the price fall, it could have been much worse. A recent
spot tender from Scottish Power was awarded for Australian coal of this
quality at Dollars 31, fob.
These prices will flow on to some 17m tonnes of Australian coal burned in
Japanese power stations as well as setting the Australian price for Taipower
in Taiwan and South Korea's Kepco.
The one small gain claimed by one of the major steam coal producers last
week was that the price reduction was less - albeit marginally - than the
Dollars 1 cut for semi-soft coking coal. It is from excess coking coal,
however, that the steam coal market is now threatened.
This year's Japanese steel mill settlements saw a 10 per cent cut in tonnage
from Australian and Canada for hard coking coal and much bigger cuts for
soft coking coal. As these coals can readily double up as very high quality
steam coals and as many existing mines are planning extensive expansions in
output (for example, Australia's biggest producer, BHP-Utah, alone is
lifting production by 7m tonned to 38m tonnes over the next few years),
there is a danger that unbought coking coals, combined with expanding steam
coal production, could swamp the market.
UK coal imports in 1991 rose to 19.5m tonnes from 14.7m tonnes in 1990.
Steam coal imports - mainly for power generation - rose by 69 per cent to
9.2m tonnes. Of this 6.3m tonnes went into Liverpool, largely for PowerGen's
Fiddlers Ferry station (1.3m tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes the
previous year) and the Thames power stations of West Thurrock and Tilbury
(both National Power) and Kingsnorth (PowerGen).

   Australia's Sale of Commonwealth Banking Stake
   Is Test of Plans to Sell Other Government Assets

   SYDNEY, Australia -- The government's planned float of
part of Commonwealth Banking Corp. will be by far the biggest
ever initial public offering in Australia -- and a litmus
test for the ruling Labor Party's controversial program to
sell a clutch of government assets.
   The listing of about a 30% stake of the bank could raise
as much as 1.6 billion Australian dollars (US$1.24 billion),
though industry analysts are betting that figure probably
will be scaled down to just over A$1 billion. By comparison,
the amount of capital raised from new listings on the
Australian Stock Exchange has averaged A$2 billion a year
during the past four years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While bank officials are tight-lipped on details of the
planned new listing, they do say that they aim to have a
prospectus available around mid-May, in time for the shares
to be traded on the stock market by the end of June.
   Foreign investors, though, will have to bide their time.
The company's Commonwealth Bank unit, a big housing lender,
is one of the Labor Party's most sacred cows, and party
stalwarts were reluctant to let even a portion of it go. The
reluctance is reflected in several of the rules governing the
partial privatization, one of which bars non-Australians from
taking up shares in the initial offering. They will be free
to trade in the shares once they are listed, however.
   The success of the Commonwealth Bank issue is crucial to
the Labor Party's efforts to make the country more efficient
by selling off parts of government-owned assets.
   "If the first one gets off the ground with a bad start, it
makes all the others even more difficult," says Bryan Madden,
research director at Prudential Securities Inc.'s Australian
office.
   That, in turn, would deal a blow to the stock market,
which is counting on the government's privatization program
to bolster its standing. Selling government assets to the
public "would have a positive impact on the liquidity of our
stock market," says Laurence Cox, chairman of the Australian
Stock Exchange.
   Several bank analysts believe that the government, in
order to reduce the chances of the float fizzling, will pitch
Commonwealth Bank shares to the public at a lower price than
they otherwise might.
   Philip Leslie, Commonwealth Bank's chief manager of
finance, won't comment on the amount to be raised or the
proposed price of the shares. But he does say that rules
governing the float prevent the bank from raising more than
A$1.6 billion from the 30% stake. That arrangement grew out
of Commonwealth Bank's bailout last August of troubled State
Bank of Victoria, which was owned by the cash-strapped state
government of Victoria.
   To pay for the takeover -- which cost Commonwealth Bank
A$1.6 billion -- Federal Treasurer Paul Keating said the bank
would have to raise funds from investors, because Canberra
couldn't afford to foot the bill.
   The takeover made Commonwealth Bank Australia's largest in
terms of domestic assets.
   At home, Commonwealth Bank claims about 25% of the
nation's bank deposits. It leads the country in housing loans
with about a third of the market in its portfolio, which bank
analysts consider virtually risk-free.
   Unlike the three other big Australian banks -- National
Australia Bank Ltd., Westpac Banking Corp. and Australia &amp;
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. -- Commonwealth Bank has few
assets abroad. It did acquire a 75% stake in ASB Bank Ltd. of
New Zealand in 1989, and it has two small investments in
National Bank of Solomon Islands Ltd. and Resources &amp;
Investment Finance Ltd. in Papua New Guinea.
   Mr. Leslie of Commonwealth Bank says that up to 5% of the
new issue is likely to be reserved for bank employees. And
while details still are being worked out, he says that "it's
reasonable to assume" that a certain portion of shares also
will be earmarked for the bank's customers.
   Besides barring foreign investors from the initial offer,
the Labor Party has laid down other long-term guidelines for
the new issue. For instance, although other Australian banks
are allowed to have cross-holdings in each other, no bank,
foreign or domestic, will be permitted to hold shares in
Commonwealth Bank. In addition, while legislation permits a
single investor to own as much as 10% of an Australian bank
(except for Westpac, which stipulates a cap of 8% on
ownership of its shares), the ceiling for Commonwealth Bank
is 5%.
   Another peculiarity, Mr. Leslie notes, is that unlike
other Australian banks, deposits and other liabilities of
Commonwealth Bank carry an explicit government guarantee.
"That guarantee will stay" even after the bank is publicly
traded, he says. And that gives the bank a competitive
advantage by reducing its cost of funds.
   Industry analysts say investors considering a stake in
Commonwealth Bank will use National Australia Bank as a
benchmark, mainly because of the similarity in perceived
quality and spread of assets and the bank's risk profile, or
relatively low level of nonperforming loans.
   Consequently, says Stephen Cleugh, who tracks banks for CS
First Boston Australia Equities Ltd., Commonwealth Bank
shares will have to be pitched close to the price-earnings
ratio of National Australia Bank to make them an attractive
alternative for local investment institutions. The shares
also will have to give a prospective dividend yield of 8% to
9%, fully franked, which means tax-free in the hands of
investors, he says. Mr. Cleugh expects the bank to try to
raise between A$1.3 billion and A$1.6 billion.
   Given National Australia Bank's strong capital-adequacy
position, particularly in the wake of a proposed A$1 billion
capital raising through a one-for-five share-rights issue
recently announced, Commonwealth Bank will be under pressure
to show a strong capital base. The rights issue will boost
National Australia Bank's so-called Tier 1 capital to nearly
7% from 5.4%. That means Commonwealth Bank, incorporating
State Bank of Victoria, will have to show at least 5.5%, Mr.
Cleugh says, well above the mininum 4% stipulated by the
Reserve Bank of Australia, the country's central bank.

   Robert Holmes a Court withdrew from his bidding war with Rupert Murdoch for Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd. in return for certain Herald assets. 

   Mr. Holmes a Court also agreed to drop all legal proceedings against the bid by Mr. Murdoch's News Corp. for Herald. 
The agreement apparently ends the battle for control of Australia's largest media group. 

   A joint statement said Mr. Holmes a Court's Bell Group Ltd. and associated companies will sell their shares in Herald &amp; Weekly Times and Queensland Press Ltd. to Murdoch companies at their latest offer prices. 
Those prices are established by News Corp.'s formal takeover offer, equivalent to $9.64 for each Herald &amp; Weekly Times share, and a verbal offer made last Friday by Mr. Murdoch of $14.78 a share for Queensland Press. 

   Queensland Press is the largest single holder of Herald shares, with a 24% stake. 
Herald, in turn, owns 48% of Queensland Press. 
Mr. Holmes a Court holds 14% of Queensland Press. 

   In return, Mr. Murdoch agreed to sell two Herald assets -- Western Australian Newspapers Ltd. and the Melbourne television station HSV7 -- to Mr. Holmes a Court for a total of $295.6 million. 

   The arrangement reached yesterday is "commercially sensible on both sides," said Peter Chegwyn, finance director at News Corp. Analysts added that Mr. Holmes a Court came out of the fight with the assets he most wanted. 

   With Western Australian Newspapers, Mr. Holmes a Court will gain control of the major Perth daily, the West Australian, which he will be able to merge with his weekly paper, the Western Mail. 
The combination of the Melbourne television station and his stations in Perth and Adelaide creates a major network with big advantages for program distribution and advertising sales. 

   Analysts also estimate that Mr. Holmes a Court's companies stand to make a gross profit of about $69.4 million on the sale of their shares in Herald &amp; Weekly Times and its associated companies to Mr. Murdoch. 

   Mr. Murdoch, meanwhile, may have to sell some assets to comply with Australian regulations against concentration of media holdings. 
In New York, a News Corp. spokesman noted that Herald assets that would be acquired by Mr. Murdoch include a television station and a newspaper in Adelaide. 
Because Mr. Murdoch already owns a newspaper in Adelaide, he may have to sell the television station and one of the newspapers, the spokesman said. 

   The tussle for Herald began Christmas Eve, when Mr. Holmes a Court's J.N. Taylor Holdings Ltd. bid $8.35 a share for Herald &amp; Weekly Times, topping the $7.71-a-share bid by News Corp. early in December. 
On New Year's Eve, Mr. Holmes a Court raised his offer to $8.68 a share. 
Mr. Murdoch's News Corp. in turn bettered that offer with a $9.64-a-share bid that now carries the recommendation of the Herald &amp; Weekly Times board. 

   "It was a question of how much pressure each could exert on the other," said John Poynton, director of a Perth brokerage, Hartley Poynton Ltd. 
"They couldn't come to an agreement early on, so Mr. Holmes a Court made his first bid, and every action since then has been calculated to produce leverage." 
Mr. Holmes a Court couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Mr. Murdoch had raised his stake in Herald &amp; Weekly Times to 16%, and Mr. Holmes a Court had put the News Corp. bid under pressure through a series of legal moves. 

   In the supreme court of the state of Victoria, Mr. Holmes a Court had challenged Mr. Murdoch's right as an American citizen to own more than 15% of Herald &amp; Weekly Times under the provisions of Australian broadcast legislation limiting foreign ownership. 
Mr. Holmes a Court also had initiated action against Queensland Press, to prevent it from accepting News Corp.'s offer for its Herald shares without a special shareholders' meeting to consider the proposal. 

   Queensland Press had been the subject of a bid by the Sydney-based media group, John Fairfax Ltd. Fairfax had offered $9.50 a share for Queensland Press conditional on the Queensland media company's acceptance of Mr. Holmes a Court's offer for Herald &amp; Weekly Times. 
A Fairfax spokesman said the company didn't have any immediate comment on the agreement between Messrs. 
Murdoch and Holmes a Court.

FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Packer's Westpac purchase keeps
the markets guessing - The Australian bank was an obvious target, but what
is Kerry Packer's strategy?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SINGLE question was reverberating around Australia's business community
yesterday: what is Kerry Packer up to? It is a question which has been asked
many times before. As usual, it prompted plenty of speculation, but few
answers.
There was little surprise when Mr Packer, the entrepreneurial owner of the
Consolidated Press Holdings (ConsPress) publishing group, emerged on
Thursday as the buyer of an 8.27 per cent stake in Westpac Banking
Corporation, the troubled Australian bank.
Market gossip had linked Mr Packer with Westpac since October, when the
bank's ADollars 3-a-share, ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 825m) rights issue had
closed 72 per cent under-subscribed, leaving dozens of sub-underwriters
holding some 290m shares.
The shares, representing about 19 per cent of Westpac's expanded share
capital, were worth significantly less than ADollars 3 in the stock market,
and were ripe for acquisition by a buyer with plenty of cash.
But why was Mr Packer willing to bail out the underwriters when so many
other shareholders, including many of Australia's institutional buyers, were
unwilling to take up their rights only a few weeks earlier?
Is he simply spending some of his cash on an undervalued recovery stock? Is
he hoping to pick up windfall profits if a rival bidder appears? Or does he
want to run Westpac?
Only three people know the answer: Mr Packer, who is believed to be playing
polo in Argentina; Mr Al Dunlap, the irascible American chief executive of
ConsPress; and Mr Packer's son Jamie, who is being groomed to inherit the
company.
None are likely to explain the strategy unless forced to do so. As Mr Packer
told a parliamentary committee last year, the affairs of ConsPress are no
business of anyone but the sole shareholder - himself.
However, Mr Packer has clearly been poised to make a major investment since
March, when he completed a reconstruction of ConsPress which left the group
debt-free with assets of about ADollars 3bn, including ADollars 1bn in cash.
He spelt out his long-term strategy in broad terms in a rare interview in
April with Australian Business Monthly, one of his own magazines.
'I believe that over the next two or three years there are going to be
terrific opportunities, and that anyone in a position such as ours will be
able to take advantage of anything that comes up,' he said.
Westpac's problems made it an obvious target. Shortly after the rights issue
debacle, five directors resigned, including the then chairman, and the bank
subsequently reported a net loss of ADollars 1.5bn for the year ended
September, after writing off more than ADollars 2.6bn against bad and
doubtful loans.
The bank's problems were reflected in its share price, which fell from
ADollars 4.52 in January to a low of ADollars 2.39 earlier this month,
presenting a rare opportunity to acquire a significant stake cheaply.
Westpac shares closed at ADollars 2.99 yesterday, suggesting that Mr Packer
has already made a small profit on his holding, which was acquired at prices
of between ADollars 2.52 and ADollars 2.93.
Mr Packer may expect the shares to continue to rise as the bank returns to
profitability over the coming year. He may also be positioning himself for
the possibility of a victory by the opposition conservative coalition in
next year's federal election. That would probably lead to an easing of
restrictions on bank takeovers and open the way for a bid for Westpac from
one of Australia's stronger banks.
However, Mr Packer is rarely a passive investor. His strategy is to buy
undervalued companies, and add value to his holding by restoring
profitability as quickly as possible. To do that, he needs control, and the
key question is what level of control he thinks he will be able to exercise
over Westpac.
By Friday evening, ConsPress is believed to have expanded its shareholding
to the 10 per cent ceiling on individual limit on shareholdings imposed by
Westpac's deed of settlement and the federal Bank Shareholdings Act.
The act allows a maximum individual shareholding of 15 per cent, with the
approval of Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), who
would have to rule that the increased stake was not against the national
interest.
Mr Dawkins' office said yesterday that Mr Packer had not requested
permission to exceed 10 per cent. However, a 1986 precedent involving Mr
John Spalvins' Adsteam group suggests he will be allowed to increase his
stake if he wishes.
A 15 per cent holding would not give Mr Packer control. But it would
probably give him two board seats, and a level of influence comparable with
that wielded by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution,
which also owns 15 per cent of Westpac.
Given his record, Mr Packer's goal would probably be to speed the bank's
return to profitability by accelerating the recovery programme announced
recently by Mr Frank Conroy, Westpac managing director.
Analysts say it is not clear how that might be done. But Mr Packer's views
appear remarkably similar to those of the AMP, which recently gave Westpac a
six-month deadline to deliver a significant improvement in performance.
Mr Ian Salmon, AMP managing director, was enthusiastic about Mr Packer's
investment yesterday, suggesting that there may be a degree of common
ground. If that were so, Mr Packer's influence could be much greater than
his limited shareholding would suggest.
For the time being, however, there are still no real answers to what
Australia's most enigmatic businessman is up to. But, barring an unexpected
collapse in the share price, he seems likely to make a healthy profit
whatever happens.

FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westpac management given year's
deadline

SENIOR management of Westpac, the troubled Australian bank, was yesterday
given a year to solve the bank's problems before facing pressure for changes
from institutional shareholders.
Mr Ian Salmon, managing director of the AMP Society, Australia's biggest
financial institution, said it had been made clear to Westpac management
that the bank's operational performance must be improved quickly.
'They will do it in the course of the next six to 12 months or I guess the
board will decide they can't do it and make some alternative arrangements,'
he said.
The AMP is Westpac's biggest shareholder with just under 15 per cent of the
stock and two seats on the board. It has supported the bank's board and
senior managers over the past two years in spite of a series of poor
results.
Mr Salmon said there was no need for further board changes following the
resignations last month of five directors, including Sir Eric Neal, the
former chairman.
However, he said the AMP would 'have something to say' if Westpac were not
moving in the right direction within six months. 'We can apply a little bit
of leverage. We have a fair shareholding. I think we would get a lot of
support,' he said.
Westpac shares fell to a low of ADollars 2.42 on the Australian Stock
Exchange after Mr Salmon's comments, but recovered to close at ADollars
2.50, down one cent on the day. The shares fell 24 cents to a nine-year low
of ADollars 2.51 on Friday, following the announcement of an unexpected
ADollars 115m (USDollars 80m) tax charge in the US.
The US tax problem followed a failed ADollars 1.2bn rights issue and a
disastrous first half, in which the bank incurred a pre-tax loss of ADollars
2.2bn after writing off ADollars 2.65bn against bad debts.

WESTPAC Banking Corpor-ation yesterday announced net losses of ADollars
1.56bn (USDollars 1.07bn) after abnormal items for the year to the end of
September, a record for Australia's four national trading banks.
The result contrasted sharply with a ADollars 675m net profit announced by
the more conservatively managed National Australia Bank. Earlier this week,
Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation revealed a net loss of
ADollars 579m.
Westpac reported net profits of ADollars 104m for the second half, but the
return to profitability was swamped by the bank's first-half loss of
ADollars 1.66bn, which followed a ADollars 2.65bn write-off against bad
loans.
The bank said second-half net profits were ADollars 268m before abnormal
losses of ADollars 106m relating to US tax, a ADollars 51m pension fund
writedown, and a ADollars 7m writedown of its 6.2 per cent shareholding in
the ANZ bank.
The directors cut the final dividend from 12 cents to 6 cents, making a
total of 18 cents a share, compared with 24 cents. The board maintained full
franking, but said future increases in dividends would depend on
performance.
The result ends a year during which five directors resigned and the bank was
given six months to improve performance by the AMP Society, its biggest
shareholder.
Westpac strengthened its balance sheet after the first half through a
ADollars 1.2bn fully underwritten rights issue, but was embarrassed when
shareholder scepticism left the issue 72 per cent undersubscribed.
Mr Frank Conroy, managing director, acknowledged that the bank would be
vulnerable to a takeover if the federal government relaxed its ban on
mergers between Australia's big six financial institutions.
Mr Conroy said shareholders were likely to be 'not very happy' with the
result. However, he said there was 'some evidence' that the bank's
profitability was starting to improve.
Profitability before tax, bad debts and abnormal items had been stable for
18 months at an annualised level of about ADollars 1.3bn. The capital ratio,
which reflects balance sheet strength, had improved from 8.4 per cent to 9.7
per cent following the rights issue. And problem assets had fallen to
ADollars 7.6bn from ADollars 8.2bn before specific provisions.
'Taken together . . . we have the foundation from which to recover our
financial performance over time, and reposition the bank to its rightful
place in the market,' Mr Conroy said.
Westpac said it intended to reinforce the recovery in profitability by
cutting costs and increasing revenue by ADollars 300m by next September;
cutting its expense to income ratio from 70 per cent to 58 per cent over
three years; and reducing its corporate lending assets by ADollars 10bn by
1995.
Westpac shares closed 3 cents higher on the Australian Stock Exchange at
ADollars 2.65, still 35 cents below the offer price for the recent rights
issue.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Australian group faces ADollars
445m break-up bid

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ADollars 445m (USDollars 324m) break-up bid was launched last night for
Foodland Associated, the troubled Western Australian retail, wholesale and
property group.
Mr Graeme Hart, a New Zealand entrepreneur, is joining forces with
Australia's Coles Myer to acquire and then divide the company.
The bid is being made by Rank Commercial, Mr Hart's private company, and is
pitched at ADollars 5.27 a share. It is conditional on a minimum acceptance
level of 75 per cent, and on approvals from Australia's Foreign Investment
Review Board and the Trade Practices Commission, the competition watchdog.
The TPC said it would 'closely examine' the offer, paying particular
attention to the role of Coles Myer. Coles is one of Australia's biggest
retail groups.
Mr Hart, a former truck-driver who has built his fortune by buying a series
of companies at knock-down prices, is believed to be one of New Zealand's
wealthiest individuals. His Rank company already owns a 14.9 per cent
interest in Foodland, most of which was acquired from a single institutional
shareholder last month.
If the offer is successful, Rank says its aim is to spin off Foodland's
substantial New Zealand assets - which include the Farmers Deka discount and
department store group, and a 57.4 per cent interest in the Progressive
supermarkets group - as a separate company, distributing shares in this
entity to Foodland's remaining shareholders.
Rank, which by then would own at least 75 per cent of Foodland, would pass
its shares in this new company to Whitcoulls, the New Zealand bookseller and
stationery group.
Rank would offer its remaining stake in Foodland, which would be reduced to
its Australian assets only, to Coles. Rank said the break-up bid was being
financed by bank borrowings, to be supplied by National Australia Bank,
Credit Suisse and Bank of America.
The bank facilities were still subject to 'satisfaction of a number of
conditions (including completion of documentation)'.

<HL> Holmes a Court Agreement to Buy Assets From Fairfax Ended by Mutual Consent </HL>

<IN> TNM PUB </IN>
<DATELINE> SYDNEY, Australia  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Group Ltd. and John Fairfax Ltd. ended by mutual consent an agreement under which Fairfax was to have sold to Bell Group assets including national daily business newspapers in Australia and New Zealand. 

   Bell Group said events beyond both parties' control frustrated their contract, which had called for the payment of about 475 million Australian dollars ($338.7 million) to Fairfax. 
Mr. Holmes a Court had been pressing Fairfax to lower the price, according to sources close to the negotiations, especially after the October stock-market crash, which has prompted asset sales by the Australian financier's companies. 

   After studying the Fairfax media operations, Mr. Holmes a Court wanted to drop the ones incurring losses. 
Fairfax and Bell Group also couldn't agree on details of printing and distribution arrangements for the newspapers. 
Bell Group doesn't have a national newspaper network and needed Fairfax to help with production. 

   Since October, Mr. Holmes a Court's companies have been shedding assets to raise money for debt payments. 
The sales have raised more than four billion dollars, though they have resulted in losses estimated at 512 million dollars for Mr. Holmes a Court's companies. 

   Fairfax also has been selling assets to cut the borrowing costs of its takeover last year by a member of the founding family, Warwick Fairfax. 
Fairfax, Australia's biggest publisher after Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., has sold its magazine division and some smaller newspapers, but it hasn't been able to complete plans to sell other assets to Mr. Holmes a Court and Mr. Murdoch. 

   Bell Group had agreed last September to buy from Fairfax the daily Australian Financial Review, the Australian paper Times on Sunday, the New Zealand daily National Business Review and other media interests. 
Late last year, Mr. Holmes a Court exercised an option to sell the Australian Macquarie radio network back to Fairfax for 158 million dollars. 

   Fairfax said it is studying ways to keep all or part of the business newspapers and the Times on Sunday. 
A Fairfax official said a foreign partner, such as the British publisher Pearson PLC, might be sought for the business newspapers. 
Pearson was negotiating with Mr. Holmes a Court to acquire at least half the Australian Financial Review before Bell Group's agreement with Fairfax was ended. 

   In London, Frank Barlow, chief executive officer of Pearson's Financial Times unit, said: "We have been informed that the Bell Group and Fairfax do not intend to proceed with the transfer of the Australian Financial Review Group. 
This does not diminish our interest in this title and we shall now be contacting Fairfax directly."

   Directors of ELDERS IXL LTD. today will consider a major shareholder's restructuring proposals, which analysts said could include selling some of the concern's Australian and British operations to its shareholders and the sale of Elders's 18% stake in Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's largest company. 

   A restructuring was proposed by AFP Investment Corp., which controls 20% of Elders's shares and Friday said it obtained options for another 14% from Goodman Fielder Ltd. and 6% from SA Brewing Holdings Ltd. 

   AFP, which said it won't exercise those options unless Elders's directors agree to a restructuring, didn't give details of its proposals. 

   Analysts said a merger of Elders and AFP also is possible. 

   AFP is an investment company with stakes in Elders, the textiles company Linter Group Ltd. and Gestetner Holdings PLC of Britain, among others. 

   Elders is one of Australia's biggest companies. 
Its Foster's beer division produces about half the country's beer. 
It controls Courage Ltd., a British brewer, and Carling O'Keefe Ltd., a Canadian brewer. 

   Elders also is an international trader of farm products and commodities, controls an Australian mining company named Elders Resources Ltd. and operates stock-brokerage and financial-services concerns world-wide.

FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Refitted Bond flagship nears
relaunch - Kevin Brown examines the new-look, slimmed-down, renamed Southern
Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond Corporation Holdings, Mr Alan Bond's quoted flagship, is likely to be
relaunched later this year following approval from the Australian Securities
Commission (ASC) for a change of name to Southern Equities.
The company's impending re-emergence contrasts starkly with the fate of Mr
Bond, the best known of Australia's 1980s entrepreneurs, who was declared
bankrupt last month after losing a year-long court battle.
Mr Peter Lucas, chairman of Bond Corp from September 1990 until last month,
says Southern Equities will bear little resemblance to Mr Bond's company.
'We have sold many of the assets to repay debts, and the group is obviously
much smaller than it was, but the really important thing is that despite all
the things that happened, we are still here,' he says.
'Sure, it is with the good grace of our creditors, but nevertheless we were
able to convince them that this was the best way forward. That is very
different to what happened to some of the other entrepreneurial groups.'
Mr Lucas, a Sydney lawyer, resigned last month after steering the group
through the traumatic 18 months since Mr Bond quit under pressure from
shareholders and creditors.
Mr Lucas's resignation clears the way for a new management team to take over
after the completion of a financial reconstruction which will transfer 90
per cent of the company's equity to creditors and bondholders.
The distribution of shares is expected to take place as soon as the
administrators of the company's scheme of arrangement finish investigating
claims from creditors, probably by the end of June.
The principal shareholder is expected to be Australian Consolidated
Investments (Acil), formerly Mr Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Resources,
which will emerge with 11 per cent of the expanded equity. Mr Bond's
shareholding will fall from 52 per cent to 5.6 per cent.
Shortly after the redistribution, the company will be renamed and its
ADollars 1.9bn (USDollars 1.43bn) debt burden will be written off in return
for a payment of ADollars 190m to creditors - an effective payout of 10
cents in the dollar.
Mr Lucas, who remains a consultant to Bond Corp and a member of the
management committee which has run the company for the last year, says
completion of the reconstruction will be the trigger for a fresh start,
following the disposal of much of the group's former ADollars 10bn in
assets.
The disposals included Bond Media, the group's television and radio arm
which was sold to Mr Kerry Packer, and Bond Brewing, once Australia's
biggest brewer, which is now controlled by Lion Nathan of New Zealand.
The value of the group's remaining assets will remain unclear until the
1991/92 accounts are published, probably in the second half of the year. But
its main assets are:
A 1.5 per cent shareholding in BSkyB, the UK satellite television business,
and convertible loan stock worth Pounds 350m (USDollars 619m). The
shareholding is mortgaged, but Bond Corp says it hopes for some return as
BSkyB moves into profit.
A 5.3 per cent stake in G. Heileman, the US brewery once owned by Bond Corp,
which was placed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after being unable
to service its debts.
About ADollars 25m in cash, mostly held by Bond Corp subsidiaries, which the
group is unable to access until the redistribution of shares has taken
place.
Land in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, some of which
could be sub-divided for property development. The group also retains small
investments in a handful of public companies.
Potential tax losses of several hundred millions of dollars as a result of
its ADollars 2.2bn loss in 1990, although it is unclear how the losses will
be treated by the taxation office.
A ADollars 500m claim for damages against the Western Australian government
and two local politicians over a failed attempt to establish a petrochemical
industry in the state.
Mr Lucas says Bond Corp remains interested in the petrochemical project,
which collapsed in September 1989 when the state government withdrew its
support following local criticism of the deal.
Bond Corp, which paid ADollars 400m to buy Petrochemical Industries (Picl)
from the Western Australian entrepreneurs Mr Laurie Connell and Mr Dallas
Dempster, claims the government acted in bad faith.
However, Mr Lucas says the group believes the project remains viable, and
wants to help the state tap the strong demand expected to develop in Asia
for the caustic soda, ethylene di-chloride and PVC the plant would produce.
'I believe Australia has got a window of opportunity in the next five years
to get this thing up and away. Sooner or later, industrial expansion in
China, Korea and Indonesia will create a huge demand for these products,' Mr
Lucas says.
'Whether Bond Corporation Holdings could be involved would depend on the
Western Australian government and the other joint venture partners. But our
discussions with potential investors indicate it could be viable.'
Mr Lucas says Bond Corp has substantial expertise which could be made
available to the Western Australian government, together with 'the capacity
to influence the potential participants'.
The state government is also believed to be considering a revival of the
project, but is unlikely to want Bond Corp to play any part unless an
out-of-court settlement of the damages claim can be reached.
Both sides deny suggestions a settlement is being prepared. Mr Lucas says
Bond Corp is 'open to compromise, but will not retire without proper
compensation'.

   Bond Corp. Holdings, which bought a 19.9% stake in Bell Group Ltd. from Robert Holmes a Court in late April, announced a takeover offer valuing Bell Group at 860 million Australian dollars (US$690.2 million). 

   Bond Corp. -- a brewing, media, property and mining concern controlled by Australian financier Alan Bond -- is offering A$2.70 (US$2.17) a share for Bell Group, compared with Friday's stock-market price of A$2.10. 

   Bell Group's holdings include a 43% interest in Bell Resources Ltd., which in turn owns 11% of Broken Hill Proprietary Co., a steel, mining and oil concern that is Australia's biggest company. 
Before selling most of his 46% controlling interest in Bell Group in April, Mr. Holmes a Court had used the Bell concerns to buy and sell stakes in dozens of companies world-wide in recent years. 

   Bond Corp.'s offer is made on condition that Bell Group and Bell Resources not sell any significant assets, and that a A$1.04 billion takeover bid for Bell Resources by two other financiers not succeed. 
In addition to its stake in Bell Group, Bond Corp. owns nearly 7% of Bell Resources. 

   The bid for Bell Resources was announced in March by a joint venture of Sir Ronald Brierley, a New Zealand financier, and Kerry Packer, an Australian publisher and investor. 
They own nearly 7% of Bell Resources. 

   Bond Corp.'s bid for Bell Group is part of a fight for control of the Bell companies that started April 29, when Mr. Holmes a Court sold 19.9% of Bell Group to Bond Corp. at A$2.70 a share and another 19.9% to the State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia at A$2.50 a share. 
Those sales sparked an investigation, still under way, by Australia's National Companies and Securities Commission. 
The regulators are concerned that control of Bell Group might have changed hands without minority shareholders being offered a chance to sell at the prices received by Mr. Holmes a Court. 

   Bond Corp. said yesterday that after discussions with the regulators, it decided to offer A$2.70 a share for all of Bell Group, other than the 19.9% held by the state government insurance concern. 
The insurance concern later indicated that it plans to sell its Bell Group shares to Bond Corp. 
An official of the regulatory commission said it approves of Bond Corp.'s offer for Bell Group.

   Rupert Murdoch's NEWS CORP. sold its two Australian television stations to WESTFIELD CAPITAL CORP. of Sydney. 
Westfield paid News Corp. the equivalent of $555 million for the stations in Sydney and Melbourne, as well as some small newspapers, radio stations and a recording business. 

   News Corp. had said it would sell the television stations and concentrate in Australia on the print media. 
The sale partially offsets the cost of News Corp.'s acquisition of Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd., which leaves Mr. Murdoch's company with about 50% of the total newspaper circulation in Australia's major cities. 

   Westfield Capital, meanwhile, enters the scramble among Australian companies to set up television networks. 
Westfield will hold its newly acquired media interests through its 20%-owned Northern Star Holdings Ltd., which already owns newspapers, radio stations and two television stations in smaller cities. 

   Westfield's managing director, David Gonski, said: "Our No. 1 priority will be to go nationwide, either by linking with other networks or by acquisition." 
Analysts said one possibility would be a link with businessman Kerry Stokes, who bought Herald's television station in Adelaide and also owns a station in Canberra and a license for a station in Perth. 

   Bond Corp. last month became the first company to set up a television network covering most major Australian cities, and John Fairfax Ltd. is in position to establish a second network after adding Herald's Melbourne station to its television operations in Sydney and Brisbane.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation had achieved 'encouraging' operating results for
the 1991-92 first quarter, chairman, Sir Eric Neal, told a long and, at
times, fiery annual meeting in Sydney yesterday.
Facing a barrage of questions from shareholders dissatisfied with the bank's
performance, Sir Eric said an uncertain economic outlook precluded more
specific profit predictions.
However, he expected the group's troubled finance arm, Australian Guarantee
Corporation, to perform this year in line with the year ended September,
1991, when it made a loss of about ADollars 220m (USDollars 164m).
'Westpac has already taken the hard decisions affecting its operations,' Sir
Eric said. 'This will allow the bank to focus on better business
opportunities and to build upon its inherent market strengths.'
'Despite the continuing poor economic conditions, Westpac's operating
results for the first quarter of 1991-92 are encouraging and, if sustained,
offer tangible proof that the worst is behind us.'
Sir Eric received some much-needed public support from Australia's biggest
investor, the AMP Society, whose managing director, Mr Ian Salmon, told the
meeting the society would immediately purchase 74m Westpac shares.
Mr Salmon said the purchase would cost about ADollars 300m. It followed
Thursday night's approval from Federal Treasurer (chancellor), Mr John
Dawkins, of a long-standing request for the AMP to lift its Westpac stake
from 10 to 15 per cent.

FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Macquarie confident after record
first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACQUARIE Bank, the privately-owned Australian banking and corporate
advisory group, yesterday announced a 13.6 per cent increase in interim net
profits to a record ADollars 26.6m (USDollars 18.2m) for the six months to
the end of September.
The result contrasts sharply with big full-year losses announced last week
by Westpac Banking Corporation and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group,
two of Australia's biggest banks.
Macquarie said the improved result reflected better trading conditions,
innovative products, and a reduction in write-offs against bad and doubtful
debts to ADollars 1.5m from ADollars 2.7m in the comparable period of the
previous year.
Mr Tony Berg, managing director, said the bank was confident the improved
result would be repeated in the second half. 'I am confident the economy is
going through a slow recovery,' he said.
Macquarie said total assets increased by 28.6 per cent to ADollars 3.04bn,
while group shareholders' funds rose to ADollars 299m from ADollars 272m at
the end of the last full year in March. The bank said its emphasis on
service and tailored banking products helped expand the branch-banking
business. The property, capital markets, money market and corporate services
divisions also performed well, although fixed interest profits were hit by
difficult conditions in the government and semi-government bond market.

the United States, distributes news and photographs throughout
Australia. It owns a 7.75 percent voting stake in Reuters Holdings
PLC, the large British news and information service.
   If Murdoch's acquisition succeeds, his company would become the
biggest single shareholder in Reuters because News Corp. already
owns a 6.8 percent voting stake in Reuters.
   News Corp., which had owned 44.65 percent of the Australian
Associated Press, said it had acquired another 8.3 percent from
Bell Group Ltd., a concern controlled by Australian investor Robert
Holmes a Court.
   News Corp. said it also had agreed to acquire a 44.65 percent
stake from John Fairfax Ltd., one of Australia's major media
companies.
   Prices weren't disclosed.
   Murdoch, a native Australian who became a U.S. citizen in 1985,
already controls about 60 percent of Australia's press and has
encountered government resistance to an expansion from government
antitrust officials.
   It was not immediately clear whether Murdoch's arrangement to
effectively acquire the Australian Associated Press would be
blocked by the government. But an official of the Trade Practices
Commission, which regulates such transactions, said it would
investigate.
   The official, who declined to be identified by name, said
elements of the sale appeared to conflict with an order issued last
year that prevented Murdoch from acquiring the parent company of
the Australian Associated Press, the Australian Associated Press
Information Services Ltd.

FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Earnings of ADollars 36m for
Fairfax at halfway

JOHN Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black's
Daily Telegraph group, has announced interim net profits of ADollars 36m
(USDollars 24.4m) for the six months to end-December.
Fairfax, which was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in May, said the
figures were not comparable with the first half of the previous year, when
the group was in receivership.
However, the group earned net profits of ADollars 27m in the six months to
June, after offsetting an income-tax liability of ADollars 11.5m against tax
credits carried over from the receivership. Sales were ADollars 388.5m
compared with ADollars 357.4m in the second half of last year.
Fairfax said it benefited from higher advertising revenue and lower net
interest costs, reflecting Australia's falling interest rates and gradual
recovery from recession.
Sales of the Sydney Morning Herald and The (Melbourne) Age increased, but
the group said the difficult business environment was responsible for a 3
per cent fall in the circulation of the Australian Financial Review.
The board said it had decided in principle to build a ADollars 300m printing
plant in Sydney, which is intended to match the improved printing facilities
installed by News Corporation, Australia's biggest publishing group.
The group said the plant would be operational by 1996, allowing improved
presentation of its newspapers and reducing production costs. 'These factors
are expected to have a significant positive impact on the long term
competitive strength of the company,' the board said.
The directors said there would be no dividend, in line with forecasts in the
flotation prospectus.
The Daily Telegraph owns 15 per cent of Fairfax, but has applied to the
federal government for permission to lift its stake to 20 per cent.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Foodland offer faces probe

<TEXT>
The Trade Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog, expects to
'look very closely' at the ADollars 500m (USDollars 365m) break-up bid
launched on Wednesday for Foodland Associated, the Perth-based retail and
wholesale group.
The bidder, Rank Commercial, a privately-owned New Zealand company, intends
to divide and sell on Foodland's assets if the offer gains 75 per cent
acceptance.
Its NZ interests would be sold to Whitcoulls, a stationery and bookshop
group, while its Australian assets would pass to Coles Myer, one of
Australia's biggest retailers.
Mr Alan Fels, TPC chairman, said a major area of concern was that Coles
might find it easier to raise prices if it took control of Foodland's
Australian assets. It would move to a very strong position in West
Australian grocery retailing and already has non-controlling interests in
independent wholesalers in other states.
However, the bidding group, which met TPC officials yesterday, said it had
no reason to think the commission would block the bid, which is being
contested by Foodland.
TPC concerns, meanwhile, failed to halt a 76 cent rise in the Foodland share
price, to ADollars 5.51 - well in excess of the ADollars 5.27 a share bid
price.
Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, has filed its
defence documents in the ADollars 4bn environmental lawsuit brought against
it by some 6,000 villagers living around the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua
New Guinea, which BHP manages. It said its defence overall did not vary from
its previous position; that Ok Tedi operates in compliance with PNG law and
with the support of its government.
Foster's Brewing, the Australian brewer, has extended its licensed
production and distribution agreement with Germany's Holsten Breweries to a
national basis. It claimed the arrangements should allow it to become the
top-selling foreign beer in Germany. It is currently in the number two spot.

FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Joss takes the hot seat at
Westpac - The problems facing the bank's new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank, has a rule that
only the chairman can be questioned by shareholders at its annual meeting.
It is a convention that will be welcomed by Mr Robert Joss, the Californian
banker appointed last week to Westpac's vacant chief executive's chair.
Mr Joss, a vice-chairman of Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based regional
bank, was not present at Westpac's vitriolic annual meeting, which ended
last week after more than 16 argumentative hours spread over two days. But
after studying Westpac over several weeks, he will know for certain what
many shareholders already suspect: that things are likely to get worse
before they get better.
Mr John Uhrig, the no-nonsense miner who took over as chairman of Westpac in
October, gave much the same message to shareholders at the annual meeting,
warning that it would be 'unwise to assume that we will not have to contend
with further setbacks.'
Westpac shareholders have become all too familiar with bad news over the
last year as the bank has been hit by a catalogue of disasters which reads
like the script for a banker's nightmare.
The year started with bad publicity about risky foreign currency loans and
embarrassing leaked letters; it continued with a failed ADollars 1.2bn
rights issue; and it ended with net losses of ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars
810.3m) for the year to September, after writing off bad debts of ADollars
2.6bn.
Five directors quit in October, including Sir Eric Neal, chairman, followed
in December by Mr Frank Conroy, chief executive, after a boardroom row over
his recovery plan. Meanwhile, Mr Kerry Packer and an associate joined the
board after acquiring 10 per cent of the shares, and promptly walked out of
their first board meeting after another row.
Mr Joss, who will inherit the mess when he arrives in Sydney later this
month, will be uncomfortably aware of the giant shadows cast over Westpac by
the enigmatic Mr Packer and the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial
institution, which owns 15 per cent of the bank.
Both Mr Packer and Mr Ian Salmon, managing director of AMP, have made clear
that they want to see a rapid improvement in the bank's fortunes. But there
seems to be little agreement about how the new chief executive should go
about it.
Mr Conroy, a long-time Westpac executive who had held the top job for just
14 months, produced a recovery plan which initially commanded the support of
the entire board.
Under the Conroy plan, the bank would have cut costs and increased revenue
by ADollars 300m by September; cut its non-interest expense to total income
ratio from 70 per cent to 58 per cent over three years; and reduced gross
assets by about ADollars 10bn from ADollars 110bn.
Mr Conroy quit because the board, under pressure from Mr Packer, wanted him
to speed up the restructuring. But the board balked at Mr Packer's plans to
put the shake-up in the hands of his American lieutenant, Mr Al Dunlap, who
has acquired the sobriquet 'chainsaw' for his zeal in slashing the costs of
Mr Packer's private companies.
Mr Joss says his broad strategy is to refocus the bank on its Australian
retail operations, which he believes can be sharpened up sufficiently to
close the gap between Westpac and National Australia Bank (NAB), which has
an expense-to-income ratio of 57.5 per cent. US analysts say he is highly
regarded for the part he played in guiding Wells to recovery from similar
problems to those that face Westpac.
'It was a team effort, but he certainly played a big part in it, and that
will stand him in good stead when he takes over at Westpac,' says Mr Ray
Soifer, banking analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
But with no clear guidance from the board, it is not clear how Mr Joss will
approach Westpac's three main problems:
Poorly-performing international assets. Westpac has about 48 per cent of
gross assets outside Australia, split fairly evenly between the US, Europe,
New Zealand and Asia. The worst performing assets are in Europe and the US,
where Westpac's inferior credit-rating, caused by its bad debt problems,
makes it impossible to compete with domestic banks.
'They need to run these assets down as quickly as they can,' says Mr Craig
Drummond, banking analyst at JB Were in Melbourne.
'But it is no good just sticking all the capital back in Australia because
of the competition from NAB. So it has to be handled very carefully.'
Poor return on assets and higher-than-average expenses. Since Mr Conroy's
departure, Westpac has indicated that it is considering reducing staff by up
to 20 per cent, or 4,000 people, to help drive down its expenses-to-income
ratio. Redundancies on this scale would bring the bank's staffing into line
with NAB, but if it is done too quickly it could damage the bank's core
retail activities.
'In spite of all its problems, Westpac's share of the domestic loans and
bills market has remained unchanged at about 17 per cent,' says Mr Drummond.
'The bank has to move quickly to protect that market share, but if it moves
too quickly it will damage the retail franchise, and that is the heart of
the business.'
Bad debts. The key problem is the weak Australian commercial property
market, which has significantly reduced the underlying assets against which
many bad debts are secured. Mr Conroy tried to clear the decks last year.
But Westpac is due to revalue its property portfolio in March, and analysts
say the crucial Sydney market has fallen by more than 10 per cent since the
last revaluation in March 1992.
The revaluation, one of the 'further setbacks' feared by Mr Uhrig, is likely
to cut a further ADollars 600m from Westpac's property portfolio.
Westpac shareholders went away from last week's annual meeting less than
convinced that the worst is over, but ready to give the new chief executive
a chance.
Can he deliver? 'Wells Fargo managers are among the best the US has,' says
Mr Campbell Chaney, banking analyst at Sutro and Co in San Francisco.
'Several have gone on to clean up other banks, and Joss is equally capable
of doing that.'
Westpac shareholders will be waiting anxiously to see whether this judgment
is correct. If it is not, Mr Uhrig can expect another rough ride at next
year's annual meeting.

FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Campbell gains 53.6% of Arnotts
with AMP stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, last night claimed victory over Arnotts,
the Australian biscuit maker, after its hostile takeover offer was accepted
by the AMP Society, Australia's biggest financial institution.
AMP said it had sold a 6.3 per cent stake in Arnotts, reducing its stake to
2.2 per cent. This reversed AMP's earlier decision to reject Campbell's
ADollars 9.50-a-share offer, which values Arnotts at ADollars 1.3bn
(USDollars 870m).
The society's change of heart increases Campbell's stake in Arnotts to 53.6
per cent, comfortably in excess of the group's target of 50.1 per cent.
Further acceptances are expected before the bid closes today.
However, Campbell will be prevented from taking control of Arnotts by a
shareholding agreement which prevents the US group from appointing a
majority of board members unless it acquires 85.1 per cent of the shares.
The agreement was drawn up when Campbell took a friendly 33 per cent stake
in Arnotts in 1985 as part of the company's defence against a hostile bid by
Mr Alan Bond's Bond Corporation Holdings.
Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chief executive, said the group would encourage
Arnotts to expand its presence in the growing Asian biscuit market, which it
claims the Australian company has neglected.
Mr Johnson, who was born in Australia, said AMP's change of mind was 'wise
and responsible'. He said it would serve the national interest by assisting
Arnotts to grow.
Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said he was 'disappointed' by the AMP's
decision, but claimed it was 'out of the question' Campbell would gain
control of the board.
The AMP move was criticised by family shareholders, who have campaigned
strongly against Campbell's offer on the grounds that it would transfer
control of important Australian consumer products to foreign owners.
Ms Alice Oppen, chairman of a shareholder lobby group and a descendant of
one of Arnotts' founders, said Campbell must have offered 'inducements' to
AMP to change its decision.
She said family shareholders, who account for more than 20 per cent of the
stock, would try to ensure that Campbell was unable to achieve control of
the board.
Mr Leigh Hall, AMP's investment manager, said the society had accepted the
offer because it believed that the bid would not be increased or extended.
AMP was 'sympathetic' to calls for Arnotts to remain Australian-owned. But
he said 'Arnotts is now more than one-half foreign-owned and. . . Campbell
will in any event have a considerable input into its operation.
'Given this position, AMP considers that the size of the minority Australian
element is no longer a relevant issue.' Arnotts shares closed 1 cent lower
at ADollars 9.51.

<HL> Herald Apparently Is Won by Murdoch;
Other Firms Scramble for TV Networks

   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. apparently won the battle for Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd., Australia's largest media group. 
But the reshaping of Australia's media industry will continue, as the scramble to set up television networks intensifies with the sale of Herald's stations and the impending sale of those owned by News Corp. 

   News Corp., Herald and John Fairfax Ltd. reached an agreement Friday under which Fairfax purchased Herald's Melbourne television station for the equivalent of $214.3 million. 
Fairfax also acquired most of Herald's smaller newspapers in the state of New South Wales, as well as News Corp.'s Tamworth, New South Wales, paper, for a total of $30.1 million. 
In return, Fairfax withdrew its bid for Herald and dropped all legal action against News Corp.'s competing Herald offer. 

   The agreement paves the way for News Corp. to take control of Herald. 
Mr. Murdoch's company has acquired nearly 70% of Herald's shares, and the end of legal actions means he can step in to control the Herald board. 

   Fairfax also will ask the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to stop an investigation into News Corp.'s takeover of Herald. 
The tribunal still might continue its investigation, which is based on Mr. Murdoch's U.S. citizenship and Australian regulations prohibiting control of television stations here by foreigners. 
But analysts believe such a move isn't likely now that Herald has sold its television operations and Mr. Murdoch has said News Corp. will sell its two television stations as well. 

   News Corp. emerged from the transactions as the biggest newspaper publisher in Australia, with about 50% of the total newspaper circulation in the major cities. 
In addition to its own publications, which already cover most of Australia, Mr. Murdoch's company will retain Herald newspapers in Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart, and Adelaide, as well as a string of Herald suburban newspapers, several magazines and printing and distribution operations. 

   Analysts said the price paid by News Corp., while difficult to determine exactly, makes the complicated transactions a bargain for the Murdoch-controlled company. 
After selling the television operations of News Corp. and Herald, Mr. Murdoch might end up paying about $536 million to $670 million to greatly expand his newspaper-publishing empire. 

   The active bidding for the Herald broadcasting operations pushed their prices well above earlier offers for the stations. 
That effectively reduces the cost to News Corp. of acquiring Herald, because it gives Herald additional cash that will go to News Corp. when it takes control of Herald. 

   Fairfax, meanwhile, is in position to lead Australia's second television network with its acquisition of the Melbourne station. 
It already owns television stations in Sydney and Brisbane. 
Last month, Bond Corp. became the first company to set up a television network covering most major Australian cities, when it acquired the television operations of privately owned Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd. 

   Robert Holmes a Court, a businessman with television stations in Perth and Adelaide, might join with Fairfax to establish a national network, analysts speculate. 
Mr. Holmes a Court, under a previous agreement, is to get the Herald newspaper business in his home state of Western Australia, but failed in his bid for Herald's Melbourne television station. 

   But the carving-up of Herald also strengthened a competitor of Fairfax in the race to establish television networks. 
Herald will sell its other television station, in Adelaide, plus radio stations in the states of Victoria and South Australia, to businessman Kerry Stokes for $87.1 million. 

   Mr. Stokes owns a television station in Canberra and a license for a station in Perth. 
He also is expected to be a bidder for News Corp.'s two television stations, which could make him the leader in a third national network. 

   The buyer of the News Corp. stations is likely to be announced today. 
If another company wins the race for News Corp.'s television stations, that bidder is expected to team with Mr. Stokes to form the third network. 
The two News Corp. stations are expected to be sold for a total of about $502.4 million. 

   The carving up of Herald was sparked in part by a government proposal to liberalize laws that currently limit a company to owning only two television stations. 
That liberalization, if approved by parliament, would encourage creation of national networks, which would boost profitability for station owners. 

   The government also proposes to reduce the ability of one company to own both a television station and a major newspaper in any city. 
Such a change could present problems for Fairfax, which now will own a television station and a newspaper in Melbourne. 

   Some further redistribution of Australia's media business therefore is likely as the television networks are established and rulings are made on newspaper-television cross ownership. 
Owners of the few independent television stations that remain might sell those businesses if they bid for the News Corp. stations but fail in those offers. 
And Mr. Holmes a Court, who comes out of the Herald carve-up with few of the spoils, still might fight to improve his position, analysts say.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- The closing of bids last week for
Australia's debt-burdened Fairfax newspapers touched off an
even more contentious debate over the expected sale of some
of the country's most prestigious media assets and fanned
speculation the sale could involve an initial public stock
offering.
   John Fairfax Group Pty. Ltd. has been on the auction block
since December 1990, when bank creditors -- mainly Australia
&amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., ANZ, and Citibank of the
U.S., a unit of Citicorp, who were owed about 1.2 billion
Australian dollars (US$954 million) -- forced the heavily
indebted publisher into receivership.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since then, various foreign and domestic consortia have
been jockeying to gain control of the string of newspapers.
   Together the papers account for about 20% of newspaper
circulation in Australia and form the second-largest
publishing group. They are the main opposition to Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp., which controls about 65% of the
nation's newspapers.
   Public debate has raged for months over what is in the
national interest and, therefore, who should control the
Fairfax newspapers. In an apparent effort to have a say in
picking the winner, Australia's ruling Labor Party government
has tried to avoid setting a firm ceiling on the level of
foreign ownership of newspapers. Prime Minister Bob Hawke has
said the government wants to maintain "flexibility" regarding
the ownership of Fairfax.
   The ultimate decision on that front will rest with
Treasurer John Kerin, who generally is the final arbiter of
foreign investment in Australia. He has said he will favor
proposals that restrict foreign control of voting equity to
around 20%.
   The ownership debate became particularly intense last week
as Fairfax journalists staged a 24-hour strike to picket ANZ.
They called on Australians to close their bank accounts at
ANZ if the bank sold John Fairfax Group to a consortium that
includes Kerry Packer, who owns a national television network
and is the dominant magazine publisher as well as the
country's only billionaire.
   The journalists say they fear that Mr. Packer -- who has
been known to intervene in editorial matters -- might
interfere at Fairfax. A spokesman for Mr. Packer's bid says
these fears are unfounded.
   Baring Brothers Burrows &amp; Partners Ltd., a small Sydney
investment bank advising the bank creditors on the sale,
didn't return telephone calls for comment. But Mr. Murdoch's
national paper, The Australian, ran a front-page story
outlining details of a proposed initial public offering of
John Fairfax Group, which would be partly underwritten by
investment bank CS First Boston Australia Equities Ltd. The
proposed listing would raise A$1.5 billion.
   People familiar with Fairfax's current financial situation
estimated that amount would pitch the offer at more than 11
times the publisher's 1992 cash flow.
   News of the 11th-hour prospective listing, which would be
attractive to bank creditors because they might reap a higher
price than through a private sale, didn't surprise some of
the other bidders. "You don't have to be a genius to work
that out," said Neville Miles, an investment banker advising
Mr. Packer's consortium. It is designed, he contended, to
keep the bidders "on their toes."
   Baring Brothers Burrows hasn't given any indication when
it will name the winning bid, participants involved in the
bidding said.
   According to participants, only three groups have made
offers for John Fairfax Group. The secret bids are widely
believed to be around A$1.3 billion -- just enough to repay
the bankers, but insufficient to pay off approximately A$500
million owed to U.S. investors who bought Fairfax's
high-yield junk bonds. Separately, some of those bond holders
are suing Citibank, ANZ and John Fairfax Group over the
purchase of those securities.
   Mr. Packer is part of a group headed by Canadian publisher
Conrad Black, who publishes the London Daily Telegraph, among
other publications. The BlackPacker consortium is known as
Tourang Ltd., and would see Mr. Black holding 20%, Mr. Packer
14.9% and U.S. investment group Hellman &amp; Friedman 15%. The
rest would go to Australian investment institutions and the
U.S. junk bond holders in lieu of their debt claims.
   Because of Mr. Packer's involvement, Tourang's bid also
faces the scrutiny of antitrust regulators and those
responsible for cross-media ownership rules.
   Another bidder is a consortium headed by Tony O'Reilly,
the H.J. Heinz Co. chief executive officer who also has
publishing interests in Australia and Ireland. And the third
bidder is an all-Australian group known as Australian
Independent Newspapers that was formed to bid for John
Fairfax Group. That group has won the financial backing of
