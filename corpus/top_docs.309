   Museum curators, history buffs and urban
cowboys bought up the biggest collection of William F. ``Buffalo
Bill'' Cody memorabilia ever auctioned Friday, including a
silver-trimmed rifle that brought $22,500.
   The collection, sold at Butterfield &amp; Butterfield, consisted of
more than 300 items originally preserved by Cody's sister, Julia
Cody Goodman.
   A pair of chaps worn by the Pony Express rider, Indian fighter,
buffalo hunter, Army scout and showman sold for $1,400, and a rope
lariat went for $500.
   A silver-handled Plains rifle fetched $22,500. Other items
included Cody's buffalo-hide coat and his silver-handled toothbrush.
   ``Who better symbolizes the American West than Buffalo Bill?''
asked R.L. Wilson, historical consultant to Colt Firearms Co. of
Hartford, Conn. He came to bid on a single-action Colt revolver,
one of eight guns in the collection.
   The collection was sold by Greg Martin, a San Francisco gun
collector and history buff who bought the artifacts for $300,000
last year in Billings, Mont. He had wanted to buy only a shotgun
inscribed to Cody, but had to buy the whole lot to get the shotgun
from the elderly owner.
   Rival bidders eyeing each other across the auction floor
included curator Paul Fees of the Buffalo Bill Museum in Cody,
Wyo., and Thomas B. Morrison of the Buffalo Bill Ranch Historic
Park in North Platte, Neb.
   They vied for a collection of letters to Cody's sister
discussing his marriage, the death of his son and other intimate
events.
   ``We are interested in the correspondence because it is so
revealing and personal,'' said Fees. ``We have a strong
biographical interest.''
   The collection was unique for its large number of personal
items, including a tomahawk from his friend D.F. ``White Beaver''
Powell and dozens of photographs, show bills and theater tickets
chronicling Cody's life as the roughrider who along with shooting
champion W. ``Doc'' Carver founded the first Wild West Show.
   Carl Otis, owner of Pawnee Bill's Wild West Exposition
Re-enacted, a Northern California traveling show, dressed in white
Stetson hat and buckskin jacket for the occasion. He bid $3,000 on
a Smith &amp; Wesson ivory-handled revolver used in Cody's Wild West
Show but the gun went for $9,000.
   Private collector George Kramer, a New Jersey real estate
developer, hoped to buy Cody's silver riding bit for his
80-year-old father, who still rides. But he bid first on Cody's
Winchester rifle, inscribed and hand-carved with buffalo.
   ``That's the one item I wanted most,'' said Kramer, who
successfully bid $11,000 for it.

   A New Jersey developer and a Wild West show
owner are among the Western history buffs who bought up the largest
collection of ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody memorabilia ever auctioned _
with some pieces fetching more than twice their appraised value.
   ``Who better symbolizes the American West than Buffalo Bill?''
said buyer R.L. Wilson, a historical consultant to the Colt
Firearms Co. of Hartford, Conn., who bid Friday on one of eight
guns in the collection.
   The prices paid ranged from $175 for a telegram sent by the
legendary roughrider and showman to $22,500 for a silver-handled
Plains rifle.
   In all, more than $500,000 was spent on the collection of over
300 items, which were perserved by Cody's sister, Julia Cody
Goodman, auction officials said.
   The collection was sold by San Francisco gun collector Greg
Martin, who bought the artifacts for $300,000 last year, removing
them from storage in Billings, Mont., for the first time in 20
years.
   The collection was unique for its large number of personal
items, including Cody's buffalo-hide coat that sold for $18,000 and
a letter that sold for $3,575 in which Cody discusses the death of
his son. The prices included a 10 percent fee for the auction
house, Butterfield &amp; Butterfield.
   Also up for auction were other letters to Cody's sister
discussing his marriage and other intimate events.
   ``We are interested in the correspondence because it is so
revealing and personal,'' Paul Fees, curator of the Buffalo Bill
Museum in Cody, Wyo., said before the bidding began. ``We have a
strong biographical interest.''
   Other bidders for the letters included Thomas B. Morrison, of
the Buffalo Bill Ranch Historic Park in North Platte, Neb. Cody
descendant Walter Goodman of Dallas, Julia Cody's grandson, was
expected to bid for the letters by phone, Fees said. The names of
the successful bidders were not known.
   A pair of chaps worn by Cody sold for $1,400 and a rope lariat
went for $500. Other items included Cody's silver-handled
toothbrush, a family Bible and dozens of photographs, show bills
and theater tickets chronicling William F. Cody's life as the
Indian fighter, buffalo hunter and scout who, along with shooting
champion W. ``Doc'' Carver, founded the first Wild West Show. Cody
died in 1917.

   Buffalo Bill's buffalo-hide coat, eight
guns and a tomahawk go on the auction block today in the largest
sale yet of Wild West memorabilia collected by the legendary
William F. Cody.
   The 300 items offered for sale belong to San Franciscan Greg
Martin, who acquired the collection after he had been unable to buy
the single item he wanted.
   It was a double-barrel shotgun that brought Martin to a
warehouse in Billings, Mont., last year.
   ``I saw it up in storage ... and my pulse skipped a beat,'' said
Martin, who offered to buy the Westley-Richards English shotgun
inscribed to Cody.
   When the elderly owner refused to sell just one item, Martin
wrote a check for $300,000 for the entire collection and took it
out of storage for the first time in 20 years.
   ``He is the living symbol of the West and one of the most famous
Americans who ever lived,'' said Martin, 49, a gun collector and
aficionado of American history. ``The way we look at the West is
because of how Buffalo Bill showed it to us.''
   The collection, to be auctioned by Butterfield &amp; Butterfield,
includes the buffalo-hide coat worn by Cody and the gun he carried
as a 14-year-old Pony Express rider. Cody's single-action Colt
revolver, the type he used as a U.S. Army scout, is one of eight
guns in the collection.
   Items such as a tomahawk from Cody's friend D.F. ``White
Beaver'' Powell, along with dozens of photographs, show bills and
theater tickets chronicle Cody's life as an Indian fighter, buffalo
hunter and scout who along with shooting champion W. ``Doc'' Carver
founded the first Wild West Show.
   For 11 years, after dime-novel writer Ned Buntline persuaded
Cody to appear in the first ``Scouts of the Prairie'' show, Cody
traveled between Eastern theaters and the plains.
   The collection consists of items preserved by Cody's adoring
sister, Julia Cody Goodman, and includes the Cody family Bible and
letters to Julia in which Cody discussed a troubled marriage, the
death of his son and other intimate events.
   The engraved shotgun, the only item not up for auction, will
remain in Martin's home, a three-story Victorian crammed with
Western artifacts including a likeness of Chief Sitting Bull and
the pearl-handled Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers owned by Annie Oakley.
   Martin, a former real estate broker, once paid $1 million for
Bill Harrah's Pony Express Museum in Reno, and maintains his
collection with the help of his wife, Petra, a former federal judge
in Germany.
   He flew to Billings in search of the collection when he learned
Julia Cody Goodman's daughter, Josie, sold it for $1 to a woman
named Stella Foote to keep it from going to the Cody Museum in
Cody, Wyo., Martin said.
   The collection traveled the world under the sponsorship of the
Department of Commerce before it was placed in storage by Foote.

<TEXT>     There's the Buffalo Bill Village, a re-created Western town with authentic
buildings.;    Outside town is the big Buffalo Bill Reservoir. Then there is
the Bill Cody Ranch Resort, a hunting/fishing/riding lodge owned by Buffalo
Bill's 78-year-old grandson, also named Bill Cody.;    A few miles up the
road, not far from the entrance to Yellowstone National Park, is the Pahaska
Tepee Resort, which was built by Buffalo Bill.;    And of course there is the
Buffalo Bill Historical Center. A visit to this museum, whether you are a
Western buff or not, is worth the trip to Cody.;    The big, modern museum is
broken into four sections -- Buffalo Bill memorabilia, Western art, Plains
Indians and firearms. The museum is closed for the winter, but the group I was
with was lucky enough to get a two-hour tour of all but the firearms
collection, which was being moved to a newly-built wing.;    It was not nearly
enough time. I could have spent a day in the art section alone. It features
Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell but has a massive collection of
other Western art.;    Officially called the Whitney Gallery of Western Art,
it was created through a grant by Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. The gallery
was renovated and rededicated in 1987.;    The Plains Indian Museum offers one
of the nation's finest collections of Indian artifacts, and the Buffalo Bill
Museum is made up of memorabilia from Cody's career as a Pony Express rider,
frontiersman, scout, buffalo hunter and creator of the Wild West show the
toured the world.;    The Cody Firearms Museum, which will re-open this summer
in a new wing of the museum, displays the world's largest collection of
American-made guns.;    An interesting point made by our guide during the tour
of the Plains Indian section of the museum is that inside the museum are a
number of "medicine bundles," which are collections of items sacred to a
tribe.;    These bundles are kept in a special room with access denied to all
but specific Indians who, as representatives of their tribe, have a right to
see them. Even the curators of the museum cannot enter the room unless taken
in by a tribal representative.;    Another place worth visiting is the Irma, a
hotel Buffalo Bill built for his youngest daughter, Irma, in 1902. Many of the
rooms in the hotel are being lovingly restored by the current owners.;    The
best rooms need to be booked well in advance, but an alternative is to dine in
the big room that used to be the hotel's bar room. The centerpiece is a bar
presented to Buffalo Bill by England's Queen Victoria in appreciation for a
command performance.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For more information on Cody, or
reservations at any of the area hotels or resorts, call the Cody Chamber of
Commerce, (307) 587-2297.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Medal of Honor Restored to Buffalo Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seventy-two years after Congress stripped
Buffalo Bill Cody of his Medal of Honor, the Indian scout's name has
been restored to the honor roll.
   ``He's entitled to the honor, he was given the honor and he
should have the honor,'' said Buffalo Bill's grandson, 76-year-old
Bill G. Cody. ``We've always contended that once he was awarded the
medal, they shouldn't revoke it _ especially after he was dead.''
   William F. ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody, who became a famous western
showman after the Indian wars, received the medal in 1872 for his
gallantry as an Army scout during the wars.
   But it was revoked, along with medals of 910 other recipients, in
1917 after Congress retroactively tightened up the rules for the
honor. Among other changes, Congress held that only enlisted men and
officers could receive the award. A scout was considered a civilian;
in all, five scouts lost medals in 1917.
   U.S. Sens. Alan Simpson and Malcolm Wallop, who jointly announced
the Army's decision Friday, said Buffalo Bill deserved the honor.
   ``Today's action by the Army sets the record straight,'' Wallop
said. ``After extensive research and review of the facts, the Army
has decided that Buffalo Bill clearly deserves our nation's highest
honor.''
   Buffalo Bill gained fame for his western show that toured the
country and Europe glamorizing the western frontier with real
cowboys and Indians re-enacting battles.
   Paul Fees, senior curator of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center
in Cody, Wyo. _ a town named for Buffalo Bill _ said the western
show may have cost Buffalo Bill some credibility as a real hero.
   Friday's action restores that credibility, said Fees.
   ``The fact that this medal was restored for cause, people can
believe that he was a true hero and earned his reputation rather
than had it invented for him through press agents,'' said Fees.
   Buffalo Bill, known by his contemporaries as a Pony Express
rider, Indian scout and buffalo hunter, received the honor for valor
after leading a cavalry charge against a raiding band of Sioux
Indians. He killed two, recovered several horses, and pursued the
retreating band.
   Although Buffalo Bill's name was stricken from the Medal of Honor
roll in February 1917, one month after he died, the medal itself was
never recalled and remains in the historical center.
   Fees said only one of the other 910 persons to lose medals in the
1917 purge of the rolls has since regained it, a woman Army surgeon
during the Civil War whose medal was restored in 1978.
   He said he hoped that the families of the other four scouts
affected by the 72-year-old ruling would take the same steps the
Cody family did to get their relatives' medals awarded again.

   A forest fire that swept out of Yellowstone
National Park threatened a fir tree inscribed by western showman
Buffalo Bill Cody, and his grandson feared the worst for his
namesake's landmark.
   But it survived even though trees 6 feet away were burned.
   ``You talk about a miracle. I'll say it was,'' Bill Cody said.
   The fir tree's 4-foot-thick trunk was inscribed ``Camp Monaco
1913'' when Buffalo Bill was host to Prince Albert of Monaco on a
hunting trip in the Shoshone National Forest. Cody's famous Wild
West show was a hit in Europe.
   ``It was about this time of year when Granddad took the prince
up there,'' Cody said.
   He had been worried about the tree ever since the Clover-Mist
fire surged into the North Fork drainage about two weeks ago, but a
helicopter flight over the area with U.S. Forest Service rangers
confirmed the tree was safe.
   Camp Monaco is a half day's horseback ride from Pahaska Tepee,
Buffalo Bill's hunting lodge near Yellowstone's east entrance.
   Cody said he had been considering attempting to salvage the
inscription if the tree burned, but he started to fear the worst
when he saw from the air how much damage the fire had caused.
   ``It was a disaster all the way up the North Fork. On both sides
of the river there was nothing but burn, burn, burn,'' he said.
   But when the helicopter approached a meadow near Camp Monaco,
Cody spotted a clump of green amid hundred of acres of black.
   ``It looked just like a pinpoint in the middle of a pie,'' he
said.``When I saw the tree was saved I let out a yell. There were
burned trees within 6 feet of it, and a bottle lying about 6 feet
away was scorched.''

GENE AUTRY MUSEUM SALUTES THE WOMEN OF THE WILD WEST

With typical myopia borne of chauvinism, they talk about the Old West as the 
idyllic era when "Men Were Men." Starting this weekend, the Gene Autry Western 
Heritage Museum will take a giant step toward correcting the impression, in a 
wide-open tribute to "Daring Women of the Wild West." 
</P>
<P>
The two-month salute will draw overdue attention to the role of women in 
Western rodeos and shows from the 1800s to the present. Focus of the show will 
be an exhibit lent by the Buffalo Bill Cody Center of Cody, Wyo. (Cody's shows 
featured a variety of feisty and courageous female performers), an exhibit 
enhanced by Autry's own collection of show material from the 1880s through the 
"Golden Age of Rodeos" in the 1920s up to the barrel racers and other distaff 
daredevils of today. 
</P>
<P>
Special entertainment and pertinent films will include a pair of one-man shows 
by actor Eric Sorg, next Tuesday through April 16. Matinee performances, titled 
"Annie Oakley and the Wild West," will trace "Li'l Missy's" career as seen 
through the eyes of Cody, her mentor. Evening shows are "Cody! An Evening With 
Buffalo Bill," not entirely pertinent to the theme but a fascinating attempt to 
separate the reality from the myth of Cody. 
</P>
<P>
A series of musical performances will kick off today at 2 p.m. with Patsy 
Montana -- first female Western singer to sell a million copies of her records 
-- and an all-women Western band playing twice each afternoon on April 29 and 
May 29. Other entries in a rich and varied program will be cowgirl roping, 
Hollywood stuntwomen and films (Barbara Stanwyck 's "Annie Oakley" and Gail 
David's TV series of the same name). 
</P>
<P>
General admission to the museum, at 4700 Zoo Drive in Griffith Park (adjacent 
to the zoo), is $4.75, students and seniors $3.50, children 2-12 years $2. 
Theater admission is $3 for the general public and $1 for museum members and 
paid visitors. Call (213) 667-2000. DICK RORABACK

<TEXT>
   Frederic Remington, the painter and sculptor
best known for his depiction of the Wild West, deserves recognition
as an American master, say the curators of a traveling exhibit of
his work that opens here today.
   ``Remington has been seen superficially,'' says Michael Edward
Shapiro, chief curator at the St. Louis Art Museum. ``He's been
stereotyped as a cowboy artist when he was a very sophisticated New
Yorker who drew from a lot of sources and created his own style,
which has astonishingly imprinted itself on the conscience of our
country.''
   Shapiro and Peter H. Hassrick, director of the Buffalo Bill
Historical Center in Cody, Wyo., organized ``Frederic Remington:
The Masterworks,'' the first major traveling exhibit of Remington's
work.
   The exhibition consists of 46 paintings and drawings and 20
bronze sculptures Remington created from 1889, when he was 28,
until he died in 1909 at age 48 of complications from appendicitis.
   Among the works are ``A Dash for the Timber,'' an 1889 painting
acknowledged as Remington's first masterpiece, and ``The Bronco
Buster,'' possibly the best-known American bronze sculpture of the
19th century.
   Remington began his art career as an illustrator, with his Wild
West scenes turning up in several popular magazines, including
Harper's Weekly. His work illustrated what Shapiro describes as the
forces of nature and man and the risk of death and danger in the
West in the action and energy of Remington's horses and horsemen.
   He was especially successful at capturing the image of the horse
_ bucking, rearing, lunging, running at breakneck speed. ``There
was never a more vivid depiction of the American horse,'' Shapiro
adds.
   Indeed, Remington once told a drinking companion that if he
could have one thing written on his tombstone, it would be: ``He
knew the horse.''
   His subject was always the horse and its rider _ the
Indian-fighting soldier or the cowboy. But the West of the
homesteader, the farmer and the frontier-ending railroads held no
interest for him.
   ``While the rest of the country spoke of the advance of the
frontier, the `taming of the West,' as a positive force in the
building of American civilization, to Remington the frontier was
receding and, in the end, a tragic loss,'' historian David
McCullough writes in the show's catalog.
   Remington was born Oct. 4, 1861, in Canton, N.Y., the son of a
newspaper proprietor. He grew up in Canton and Ogdensburg, N.Y.,
then enrolled in the School of Fine Arts and joined the football
team at Yale University.
   He dropped out of Yale after a year and a half when his father
died and, at the age of 21, he headed west to make his fortune,
plunking down part of his inheritance on a sheep ranch near
Peabody, Kan.
   The sheep ranch failed, and Remington bought into a Kansas City
saloon, which also failed. His new wife had left him to go back to
New York. Remington headed west again to sketch his way through New
Mexico and Arizona.
   But by 1885, Remington was back in New York, reunited with his
wife and establishing himself as a magazine illustrator. In 1887,
Harper's Weekly carried 39 of his sketches and drawings, and the
next year more than 70.
   Remington's drawings also began to appear in St. Nicholas and
Outing magazines. He was commissioned by Century Illustrated
Magazine to illustrate a series of articles by a young Theodore
Roosevelt. The series later was made into a book titled ``Ranch
Life and the Hunting Trail.''
   Despite his popular success, Remington was never a critical
success, says Shapiro.
   His work was ``just seen as cowboys and Indians,'' he says,
``and there was a belief that cowboys and Indians wasn't serious
subject matter.''
   The exhibit goes next to the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in
Cody, Wyo., the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and closes at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

forces of nature and man and the risk of death and danger in the
West in the action and energy of Remington's horses and horsemen.
   He was especially successful at capturing the image of the horse
_ bucking, rearing, lunging, running at breakneck speed. ``There
was never a more vivid depiction of the American horse,'' Shapiro
adds.
   Indeed, Remington once told a drinking companion that if he
could have one thing written on his tombstone, it would be: ``He
knew the horse.''
   His subject was always the horse and its rider _ the
Indian-fighting soldier or the cowboy. But the West of the
homesteader, the farmer and the frontier-ending railroads held no
interest for him.
   ``While the rest of the country spoke of the advance of the
frontier, the `taming of the West,' as a positive force in the
building of American civilization, to Remington the frontier was
receding and, in the end, a tragic loss,'' historian David
McCullough writes in the show's catalog.
   Remington was born Oct. 4, 1861, in Canton, N.Y., the son of a
newspaper proprietor. He grew up in Canton and Ogdensburg, N.Y.,
then enrolled in the School of Fine Arts and joined the football
team at Yale University.
   He dropped out of Yale after a year and a half when his father
died and, at the age of 21, he headed west to make his fortune,
plunking down part of his inheritance on a sheep ranch near
Peabody, Kan.
   The sheep ranch failed, and Remington bought into a Kansas City
saloon, which also failed. His new wife had left him to go back to
New York. Remington headed west again to sketch his way through New
Mexico and Arizona.
   But by 1885, Remington was back in New York, reunited with his
wife and establishing himself as a magazine illustrator. In 1887,
Harper's Weekly carried 39 of his sketches and drawings, and the
next year more than 70.
   Remington's drawings also began to appear in St. Nicholas and
Outing magazines. He was commissioned by Century Illustrated
Magazine to illustrate a series of articles by a young Theodore
Roosevelt. The series later was made into a book titled ``Ranch
Life and the Hunting Trail.''
   Despite his popular success, Remington was never a critical
success, says Shapiro.
   His work was ``just seen as cowboys and Indians,'' he says,
``and there was a belief that cowboys and Indians wasn't serious
subject matter.''
   The exhibit goes next to the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in
Cody, Wyo., the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and closes at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

   Scenes From the Wild West
   ----

<LP>
   Princeton, N.J. -- Buffalo Bill Cody and Wild Bill Hickok
are at the White House performing a scene from a play for the
president and the first lady. In the scene, written by
19th-century author Ned Buntline, Cody and Hickok play
themselves: It features the two men rescuing an Indian maiden
in distress. Halfway through, Wild Bill rebels: He won't
"play-act" any longer. Suddenly he turns and puts a knife
into Buntline's back, and starts out after the actress who's
playing the maiden, to seduce her himself. The president and
his wife, thinking this is part of the action, are delighted.
   For Buffalo Bill, the chief character in Arthur Kopit's
play "Indians," this is symptomatic of his whole life:
Nothing turns out the way he thought it would. Hired by the
railroads to provide workers with food, he kills 4,280
buffalos, practically wiping out the Indians' supply. "How
did I know buffalo breed so slow?" he moans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sitting Bull, who had ignominiously defeated Gen. Custer
at the Little Bighorn, became Buffalo Bill's friend. After
promising Sitting Bull that he would persuade the president
to come talk to him in person about Indian grievances,
Buffalo Bill can only produce three pompous, insensitive
senators. Attempting, finally, to effect some compromise
between the government and Sitting Bull, he must stand by
helplessly as Sitting Bull is brutally assassinated and a few
days later his Sioux Indian followers are massacred at
Wounded Knee.
   After being made a hero by Buntline in novels and plays,
Buffalo Bill, prior to Wounded Knee, produced his own Wild
West show in which he featured not only Wild Bill Hickok and
Sitting Bull, but Annie Oakley, Geronimo and others. It was
playwright Kopit's inspired idea to use the Wild West
framework to produce a play that moves back and forth from
actual events to scenes from the show. As in real life, there
is a natural affinity between show business and history. We
have the pageantry of Indian ceremonies and mock shoot-outs,
mixed with heartbreaking scenes of betrayal and
misunderstanding between the federal government and the
Indians.
   In some ways Mr. Kopit's play was ahead of its time. First
produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in London, it
opened on Broadway in 1969, after which it disappeared from
sight. It is one of those underrated, overlooked plays that
not only speaks to an issue still very much alive, but is a
highly charged coup de theatre. "Indians" is just the kind of
play important regional theaters should produce. And now,
McCarter Theater, in its recently renovated space, has done
just that.
   That's the good news. The not-so-good news is that
director George Faison has not given it the kind of
production it deserves. The visual elements are there --
stunning scenery, lighting and costumes -- but the show
itself does not do justice to the theatrical nature of the
play. Being part of a Wild West show, we should be caught up
in hoopla and razzle-dazzle; we should rush headlong from one
scene to the next. But Mr. Faison, quite unaccountably, moves
the action at snail's pace. He lets one scene come to a
complete halt, takes a long pause, and painstakingly begins
the next scene. The action should unfold the way Buffalo Bill
fells fake buffalo or Annie Oakley shoots clay pigeons: bam,
bam, bam.
   Mr. Faison fares no better with his lead performer, Robert
Joy. Instead of his tepid performance, Buffalo Bill should be
charisma personified, not only to give the play a lift and a
self-assurance, but to provide a contrast with the lost,
bewildered figure who stumbles about the stage at the end.
   Despite these handicaps, there is still much to enjoy at
McCarter. The electric scene between Sitting Bull (Mel Duane
Gionson) and the three senators (John Tillotson, Don Perkins,
Gordon Stanley) is theater at its best, and several
performances -- Jay Patterson as Wild Bill Hickok, for
instance -- let us see just how much excitement "Indians" can
produce.
   Meanwhile, the first production of the Broadway season is
also a revival: Paul Osborn's "On Borrowed Time" at the
Circle in the Square Theater. The chief attraction here is
actor George C. Scott, who has traded in the gruff Gen.
Patton of films and the "Bah, Humbug" Scrooge of television
for lovable Gramps. Mr. Scott not only plays the lead but has
directed the production, assembling a strong cast that
includes Teresa Wright, Bette Henritze, Nathan Lane, Conrad
Bain and a very talented young actor, Matthew Porac.
   "On Borrowed Time" opened on Broadway in 1938, one night
before Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," with which it has much
in common. Both are set in small-town America, both rely
heavily on fantasy and both underscore the necessity of
accepting the inevitability of death. In "On Borrowed Time,"
Gramps (Mr. Scott) is taking care of his grandson Pud (Mr.
Porac) when the boy's father and mother, away for the day on
a trip, are killed in an auto accident.
   Death appears in the form of Mr. Brink, played with
tremendous eclat by Mr. Lane dressed in formal 1930s men's
attire. Mr. Brink has come to claim Gramps's wife (Ms.
Wright), who dies during the course of the action, and also
Gramps, who has several sinking spells. Before Mr. Brink can
corner him though, Gramps traps him in a tree, which means
that as long as Mr. Brink remains there, not only Gramps, but
no one on earth can die.
   Despite the emphasis on death, "On Borrowed Time" has
several uproarious scenes, some between Gramps and Mr. Brink
and others between Gramps and the prune-faced maiden aunt
(Ms. Henritze) who wants to get her hands on Pud and raise
him according to the strict precepts of her church. Gramps's
doctor (Mr. Bain) and lawyer (George DiCenzo), who cannot see
Mr. Brink, are convinced Gramps is insane and bring the head
of the local mental asylum (Allen Williams) to take him away
in a straitjacket. The joke here is that the head of the
asylum is far loonier than any of his patients.
   In the end, Gramps realizes that you cannot forestall
death, that inevitably it must be accepted. At the same time,
death will never be pleasanter, on stage or off, than it is
in "On Borrowed Time."

NO DOUBTING BILLS' THOMAS IN 30-7 VICTORY;

CARRY -- IN ROMP PAST JETS.

<P>
The Buffalo Bills' Thurman Thomas, running through the kinds of holes tailbacks 
usually only dream of, rushed for 214 yards Monday night in a 30-7 victory over 
the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' best rushing total as a pro compares to the NFL record of 275 yards by 
Walter Payton in 1977 and the Bill mark of 273 by O.J. Simpson in 1976. Thomas 
averaged nearly 12 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think of it as an individual effort," Thomas said. "It truly was team 
play. The offense came out with fire in their eyes, and they just knocked huge 
holes in the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had several big games as an All-American at Oklahoma State, where he 
preceded Barry Sanders as the star running back. This was different. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought in the NFL I would be 20 yards downfield without ever being 
touched, just me and a safety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bill tackle Howard Ballard: "We didn't really expect it to be that easy. 
We just blew them out." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills (2-1) wanted to show they are not the same bickering outfit that 
struggled to win the AFC East championship last year. The Jets (1-2) sought to 
show they are a playoff contender. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Bills who were convincing in moving back into first place in the AFC 
East, where they stood for 33 weeks before a 30-7 loss at Miami last week. 
After that game, star defensive end Bruce Smith was fined for shouting at Coach 
Marv Levy on the sidelines when Levy removed six starters with seven minutes to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jet Coach Bruce Coslet: "No team should really be allowed to manhandle us 
like that. They dominated the line of scrimmage. We have to play very well to 
have a chance against a playoff team like Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
Was it a step backward for the Jets? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably," Coslet said. "But I'm not concerned about the psyche. This is not 
last year's team. We have a lot of confidence. We stubbed our toe." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills took a 20-7 halftime lead after Thomas ran for 146 yards in 10 
carries, two yards short of his career high for a full game, against Miami last 
season. Buffalo had 305 yards and the Jets 87 in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"We established just what we wanted to do in the first half," Buffalo 
quarterback Jim Kelly said. "We took it from there." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't get any better for New York in the second half. Thomas keyed an 
85-yard, nine-play drive with 56 yards rushing, including a 34-yard burst on a 
quick-opener. Scott Norwood's 27-yard field goal made the score 23-7 and Keith 
McKeller caught a six-yard touchdown pass from Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets had gone 13 consecutive quarters without a touchdown against Buffalo 
before scoring 4:59 into the game on Brad Baxter's one-yard run. Their last 
touchdown against the Bills was scored Oct. 17, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Jet wide receiver Al Toon had two receptions before being sidelined because of 
a bruised back. He has caught a pass in 65 consecutive games.

AFC: THOMAS SCORES ON 80-YARD RUN IN FOURTH QUARTER AS BUFFALO BEATS NEW

<P>
The Buffalo Bills entered their game against the New England Patriots with an 
NFL-high 274 points. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the Patriots held the Bills to 14 points, but that was still more 
than enough against the league's worst team. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman Thomas provided the clinching touchdown on an 80-yard run with under 
two minutes left Sunday to lead the Bills to a 14-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills (9-1), who scored 87 points in their previous two games, won for the 
eighth consecutive time. The Patriots (1-9) lost their eighth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got bad breaks," Patriot running back George Adams said. "We took the 
field like we were 8-1, not 1-8. We know what we can do; it's just a matter of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second shutout in three weeks for the Bills, who blanked Cleveland, 
42-0, two weeks ago. The Patriots had not been shut out since Nov. 20, 1983, by 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who had 22 carries for 165 yards, also scored in the first quarter on a 
five-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly, the AFC's top-rated passer, completed only five 
of 15 passes for 79 yards as the Bills managed only 288 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
Patriot quarterback Marc Wilson completed 21 of 33 passes for 234 yards and had 
two passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots came closest to scoring early in the second quarter after driving 
54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bills leading, 7-0, the Patriots had a first and goal from the Buffalo 
one-yard-line. Three plays later, it was fourth-and-goal from the one and the 
Patriots went for it. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Allen, who ran effectively early in the game, tried to run off the right 
side of the offensive line. But Buffalo linebacker Ray Bentley shot through and 
stopped him for a one-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
"About four guys hit me and I shed them all and got in there," Bentley said 
jokingly. "Actually, the guard pulled out of there and I just went in where he 
left and came through untouched." 
</P>
<P>
Bentley said he was surprised the Patriots tried to run the ball, but once they 
came to the line of scrimmage, he said he knew what play was coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't necessarily know that the guard would pull, but that's a scheme they 
do have," he said. "We had great penetration on the other side to keep the back 
from bouncing outside so I could get to him." 
</P>
<P>
New England Coach Rod Rust said he didn't regret the call. "It was a good 
defense against the play." 
</P>
<P>
The play seemed to inspire the Bills' defense, which kept the Patriots in check 
until New England's next-to-last drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots moved from their 14 to the Buffalo 38. But the drive ended when 
rookie James Williams intercepted a pass by Wilson in the end zone that was 
intended for Irving Fryar. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling they were going to try and go toward me because I was a rookie 
out there," said Williams, the Bills' first-round draft choice who was starting 
for injured Kirby Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo got the ball on its 20 and the Patriots let Thomas slice through the 
line on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
"We were basically just trying to get a first down," Thomas said. "The 
offensive line came off the ball well. Usually, that play doesn't cut back all 
the way to the right, but the hole was so big I just had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Patriot safety Fred Marion said his team was "cutting down on giving up the 
easy stuff. But he (Thomas) broke right, they made good blocks and we didn't 
get over to make the play."

BILLS: THEY WIN AFC EAST AGAIN, BEATING THE SAME TEAM AS LAST SEASON TO CLINCH

<P>
It didn't happen as early as it did last season, but the Buffalo Bills are AFC 
East champions. 
</P>
<P>
The clincher came in Week 12 last season, and this year it was on the Saturday 
of the last weekend. Both clinchers, however, were at the expense of the New 
York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kelly's two touchdowns led the Bills to a 37-0 victory, as one-sided as 
last year's divisional race. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year it was early, this year it was struggle, struggle, but we're there 
again," Buffalo nose tackle Fred Smerlas said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no struggle for the Jets Saturday, except for the few fans who 
ventured to Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The game started with the temperature at 16 degrees and a wind-chill factor of 
minus-11. There were 21,148 in attendance, but there were 55,743 no-shows, 
believed to be an NFL record. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was the smallest at a non-strike Jet game since 5,826 attended a game 
against Buffalo at the Polo Grounds on Dec. 14, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a real stinging wind," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said. "It was one of 
the nicer days we've seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The weather and the loss weren't all that made it a bleak day for Jet Coach Joe 
Walton. It has been widely speculated this was his last game as Jet coach after 
taking over for the 1983 season. 
</P>
<P>
"If you stay in this business long enough, there are going to be bad times," 
said Walton, who said he wants to return next season. "I'll meet with the team 
tomorrow, thank them and wish them a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills (9-7), who had lost five of seven, ended a three-game losing streak. 
"Is it a relief to win it?" Levy asked, repeating a question. "There's always 
that pressure, but it is sweet. We've struggled hard to get here. We have been 
in first place for 32 straight weeks. It's hard to please people." 
</P>
<P>
The division title was the sixth for the Bills, who lost to Cincinnati in the 
AFC championship game last season. 
</P>
<P>
"This team deserves a lot of credit," Levy said. "They hung in there and won 
the division by earning it." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, who lost to Buffalo, 34-3, earlier in the season, finished 4-12, 
their worst record since going 4-12 in 1980. Instead of playoffs, what's next 
for the franchise is a much-awaited meeting Tuesday between Walton and Dick 
Steinberg, the team's new general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly finished 13 for 21 for 208 yards with Andre Reed catching six passes for 
80 yards. "We were the Bills of the first five games today," Reed said. "Our 
offense was clicking and our defense was clicking." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills opened the scoring with a 26-yard field goal by Scott Norwood with 
4:26 to play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, who were shut out by Pittsburgh two weeks ago, had one scoring chance 
but it ended when Pat Leahy's 30-yard field goal attempt was blocked with 8:14 
left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was all Buffalo from there. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Kinnebrew ran in from one yard 1:07 before halftime for a 10-0 lead. The 
Bills stretched it out in the third with Kelly connecting with James Lofton on 
a 25-yard pass play with 10:49 left in the quarter. It was the same distance on 
the next scoring play, this time a pass to Ronnie Harmon in the left corner of 
the end zone, and the Bills led, 23-0, with 4:39 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
"That touchdown before the half was big, but the game still wasn't over then," 
Levy said. "Jim played very well. He was a big contributor. Our team has to 
continue to play well, not just Kelly." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills made the score 30-0 on a three-yard run by Thurman Thomas shortly 
before the third quarter ended. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Davis ended the scoring with a 17-yard run with 2:44 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnebrew had 91 yards in 17 carries, while Thomas had 73 in 17 carries.

any other team.; BILLS UPDATE: Buffalo has won 11 consecutive games against
AFC East teams, including three in a row against Miami. The Bills are known
for their passing game, but they have passed 311 times and rushed 304 times.
Thurman Thomas (968 yards) is the NFL's rushing leader. Green Bay scored 24
points last week against the Bills. Unfortunately for the Packers, Buffalo
scored 34.; DOLPHINS UPDATE: QB Dan Marino is finally getting some protection.
The Dolphins' offensive line has allowed only three sacks in the past five
games after yielding 13 in the first five. Dolphins defenders will hope their
offense can control the ball. Buffalo ranks 26th in the NFL in run defense,
and RB Sammie Smith is looking for a big game. Miami's defense has forced an
AFC-low five fumbles.; KEY INJURIES: Bills -- T Will Wolford (back) is
questionable; QB Jim Kelly (back) is probable. Dolphins -- DT Bert Weidner

<TEXT>  TV/RADIO: ch. 7, 11/KCBS (740).; RECORDS: Buffalo is 5-0, first in the AFC
East. Kansas City is 3-2, second in the AFC West.; BILLS UPDATE: All-Pro DE
Bruce Smith is making his second start since recovering from knee surgery.
With Smith and NT Jeff Wright out because of injuries, the defense has given
up an average of 137 yards a game rushing -- a big factor in opponents
averaging 23 points per game. Smith did not have a tackle in his first game
back last week, but in beating the previously unbeaten Chicago Bears 35-20,
Buffalo held Neal Anderson to 54 yards rushing and the Bears to 84 rushing
yards. The Bills' powerful offense, led by QB Jim Kelly and RB Thurman Thomas,
has averaged an AFC-high 32.4 points per game. No Chiefs opponent has scored
more than 17 points this season, and the Bills have not scored fewer than 17
in any game.; CHIEFS UPDATE: The Chiefs still believe they might have beaten
the Bills in the playoffs last season had their road to Buffalo not stopped in
Miami. The Chiefs can run -- the Bills are last in the league in ball control
and are 24th against the rush. Behind Christian Okoye and Barry Word, Kansas
City's rushing game has averaged a respectable 110 yards. With QB Steve DeBerg
off to a slow start, the Chiefs' passing game is averaging less than 148 yards.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Mercury News Staff Writer;   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- When it comes to a Buffalo
Bills-Miami Dolphins matchup, perhaps it would be best to tally up the points
and individual plaudits with a pinball machine, just to keep up with the

<HEADLINE>  KELLY, THOMAS KEY BILLS
BUFFALO MAINTAINS MASTERY OF DOLPHINS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The NFL/Week 1  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The numbers rattled off with a familiar vengeance Sunday. Running back
Thurman Thomas became the first Buffalo player with more than 100 yards
rushing and receiving in the same game. Wide receiver Andre Reed caught 11
passes for 154 yards and a touchdown. Quarterback Jim Kelly, overcoming an
ankle injury, threw for 381 yards -- the most in his career -- leading the
Bills to a wild, season-opening 35-31 victory over the Dolphins before 80,252
at Rich Stadium.;   Considering Miami's 44-34 loss in the snowy Jan. 12
playoff game on Rich Stadium's tundra and a 24-14 stumble last December
against the Bills that erased all hope of home-field advantage in the
playoffs, you could say the Dolphins were primed to wash away the memories of
last season's bad luck against Buffalo. But the Bills, depleted as they were
on defense without pass-rushing defensive end Bruce Smith, who still is
nursing a surgically repaired right knee, have retained the deed when it comes
to owning Miami's number.;   "It's depressing knowing that they knocked us out
of home-field advantage up here and they knocked us out of the playoffs up
here in January and then to start the year, they do it to us again," said
Miami Coach Don Shula, whose team is minus 11 starters, four of whom are
contract holdouts.;   The Bills, despite early use of their defense-rattling,
no-huddle attack, had to come back to do it.;   Kicker Scott Norwood, the goat
of Super Bowl XXV for missing a 47-yard field goal with four seconds
remaining, preserving the New York Giants' 20-19 victory, choked Sunday on a
25-yard gimme capping Buffalo's opening drive. Miami then took a 7-0 lead as
Dan Marino (17 of 28, 267 yards, three touchdowns) tossed 43-yard flea-flicker
to Mark Clayton for a touchdown -- keeping Clayton's streak of consecutive
games with at least one reception alive at 64 -- with 8 minutes, 56 seconds
remaining in the first quarter.;   An interception by safety Louis Oliver set
up a 3-yard run by running back Mark Higgs, a return man who rushed for 146
yards in 30 carries filling in for starter Sammie Smith, who's out with a knee
injury. Higgs' touchdown put Miami ahead 14-0.;   By then, though, the
Kelly-Thomas machine was primed to go. On third-and-five from the Buffalo
46-yard line, Kelly launched a 54-yard scoring pass to Reed, pulling the Bills
closer, 14-7, with 8:45 remaining before halftime.;   Charlie Baumann's
21-yard field goal at the start of the third period increased Miami's lead to
17-7. And the Bills' problems seemed to worsen when Kelly came up limping
after Dolphins nose tackle T.J. Turner rolled onto Kelly's left ankle on a
sack attempt.;   Kelly left the field, ostensibly for the rest of the game
with a sprain. But three plays later, backup Frank Reich hit tight end Butch
Rolle on a 3-yard play-action fake, pulling Buffalo closer, 17-14.;   Would
that be it for Kelly? Hey, this guy's tough. No way.;   "It's going to take a
lot more than a bum ankle to keep me out of a game," said Kelly, who came back
to complete 29 of 39 attempts, with two touchdown passes.;   So back he came
on the next series, driving Buffalo 30 yards to midfield. On second-and-eight,
Kelly threw 30 yards on a post to Thomas, who blew past safety Jarvis Williams
and sprinted 20 yards down the right sideline for a 50-yard touchdown
reception, giving the Bills their first lead, 21-17, with 2:10 left in the
third quarter.;   Wide receiver Don Beebe's fumble set up a 5-yard scoring
pass from Marino to Clayton (6 catches, 138 yards two touchdowns), and Miami
regained the lead 24-21 with 11:18 remaining.;   But the Bills answered with a
1-yard touchdown run by fullback Carwell Gardner to pull ahead again, 28-24.; 
 Thomas scored from seven yards out to increase the lead to 35-24, and Miami
capped the scoring with Marino's 3-yard touchdown toss to Duper with 2:32
remaining.; BILLS 35, DOLPHINS 31; (box) THE HERO: Buffalo's Thurman Thomas
rushed for 165 yards and added 108 yards receiving to become the first Bill to
surpass 100 yards in both categories in one game.;   (box) THE GOAT: Bills
kicker Scott Norwood, who missed the potential winning field goal in the Super
Bowl in January, shanked a 25-yard effort with his first kick Sunday.;   (box)
KEY PLAY: Bills QB Jim Kelly hobbled back onto the field after suffering an
ankle injury to toss a 50-yard scoring strike to Thomas to give Buffalo its
first lead, 21-17.  </TEXT>

   The white men called it ``next year'' country.
   Next year the rains will come, the prairie fires (or locust or
'hoppers or blizzards) won't. Next year the price of wheat will be
up, taxes down. Next year the bank'll be paid off, the truck'll be
paid up, the cows'll pay for themselves.
   That's the American West: Next Year Country.
   Except this year.
   This year North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Washington are
celebrating their 100th birthdays, and they're having a rip-roarin'
party stetching most of the way from the Missouri River to the
Pacific Ocean.
   Wyoming and Idaho have caught the spirit, too, because next year
marks their centennials. If you missed the huge barbecues, cattle
drives, rodeos, fairs, powwows, fishing tournaments, parades,
dances, and the 101 other festivities this year, Idaho and Wyoming
promise encores in '90.
   President Bush, who earlier took part in North Dakota's
centennial observance, heads to Sioux Falls, S.D., and Helena,
Mont., on Monday to join in festivities, then on to Spokane, Wash.,
on Tuesday.
   Centennial celebrations are milestones measured long ago in much
of the rest of the nation. Virginians, Floridians, even Missourians,
may wonder: Why all the fuss?
   Well, the West has always been America's young upstart, the
shirttail relative of the establishment East, the antebellum South,
the Spanish Southwest, the conservative, agrarian Midwest.
   But in the 1980s, the West has come of age and come into its own.
It has a cachet sought by CEOs as well as collegians. Everywhere you
look, from Hollywood's movies to Detroit's cars (Mustang, Cherokee,
Dakota, Bronco) to Ralph Lauren's and Calvin Klein's designer denim
fashion, the West is IN.
   Ask Bill Cody, the 76-year-old grandson of Buffalo Bill. ``When I
was born, Granddad was one of the most famous men in the world,''
said Cody, a lookalike for the old showman. ``Even today, I go to
Singapore, Greece, Europe _ hell, even Sri Lanka _ and the locals
know about the West because of Buffalo Bill.''
   Although Thomas Jefferson never saw the West, the third president
heard the siren singing in the lonely wind there and he had a
vision. He traveled only as far as Harper's Ferry, W.Va., but
imagined the fledgling United States stretching from the Potomac to
the Columbia River, south to the mouth of the Mississippi, and north
to the headwaters of the Missouri.
   ``All eyes, all hopes, are now fixed on you,'' Jefferson wrote in
January 1803 to James Monroe, urging him to be his special envoy to
France and negotiate the Louisiana Purchase. ``On the event of this
mission depends the future destinies of this republic.''
   Monroe pulled it off. For $15 million, the United States acquired
the entire 830,000-square-mile territory claimed by France in the
New World.
   Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Bernard De Voto described it as
one of the most important events in history.
   ``Not only did it double the area of the United States, not only
did it add to our wealth resources of incalculable value, not only
did it provide a potential that was certain to make us a great
power, not only did it make equally certain that we would expand
beyond the Rockies to the Pacific ... it also provided the
centripetal, unifying force that would hold the nation firm against
disruptive forces from within,'' wrote De Voto.
   Even before his diplomats had sealed the deal, Jefferson had
secretly asked Congress for $2,500 to cover the cost of dispatching
an expedition up the Missouri River and on to the Pacific ``for the
purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States.''
The reason was a red herring, innocuous so as not to alarm the
British or Spanish who still held enormous tracts in North America.
   But it was excuse enough for Army Capts. Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark, co-commanders, to leap at the opportunity to chart a
map marked ``Unknown.''
   Lewis, who grew up on a farm called Locust Hill only 10 miles by
straight gallop northwest of Jefferson's Virginia estate Monticello,
called the chance to explore the West ``a darling project of my
heart.''
   Young Albert Gallatin, an immigrant from Switzerland who had a
good head for numbers, was Jefferson's treasury secretary and
therefore responsible for paying the venture's bills. Lewis and
Clark remembered by christening a river after him.
   Today the Gallatin name is attached to many western landmarks,
including a Montana county and the Bozeman airport. Gallatin's
oldest living descendant, Beatrice Gallatin Beuf, 82, lives just
over the Montana border in Big Horn, Wyo.
   ``When my father bought this ranch in 1911 we traveled by train
from New York to Sheridan, and there were hitching posts on Main
Street and nothing was paved,'' she recalled. ``We were met at the
station by a wagon pulled by four horses, their tails tied up in mud
knots. It took us four hours to travel 13 miles.''
   Mrs. Beuf's ranch reaches into the Big Horn Mountains, where she
still rides her Arabian mare every fair day. It was she who was
asked to sit next to Queen Elizabeth II, when the monarch dined in
Big Horn on a 1984 private visit, and regale her with stories.
   ``This is a place where the glamorous days of the cowboy are just
over your shoulder,'' said Mrs. Beuf. ``You're not choked in with
people troubles. Here your troubles are big ones: drought, too much
snow, a wind that can carry you away. Here we live with the great
realities of life.''
   After Lewis and Clark came the mountain men. The traders
followed, paddling up the Missouri and the Yellowstone rivers. As
the buffalo massacres decimated the herds, cattlemen from as far
away as the Rio Grande and even the Clyde in Scotland saw the
potential and shrewdly staked out giant ranches.
   When gold was discovered, miners stampeded for Dakota Territory
by the thousands, enterprising merchants hot on their heels.
Finally, with the 1862 Homestead Act promising 160 acres to anyone
with a strong back and the means to claim the land, sodbusters
followed.

Kansas City's six sacks, and Buffalo lost five fumbles.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "We've all been around long enough to know that isn't the Buffalo Bills
football team," Schottenheimer said after the Chiefs romped to a 33-6 victory
over the previously unbeaten AFC champions. "It was one of those nights where
everything fell our way.";   The Bills, averaging more than 32 points and 450
yards in winning their first five games, suffered six sacks, five lost fumbles
and their most lopsided loss in four years. They managed only 211 net yards,
and the Chiefs (4-2), who had only 182 yards the week before in a one-point
victory over San Diego, rolled to 397.;   "This was not only the best
defensive game I've ever been associated with," said defensive end Bill Maas,
who had two sacks. "It was the greatest game I've ever been associated with.";
  The victory snapped a five-game Monday night losing streak for the Chiefs,
who had not played a Monday night game in Kansas City since 1983.;   "There
was a lot of energy, a lot of adrenaline flowing," Maas said. "Our defense
shut down the No. 1 offense. Our offense held the ball and ran and ran and
ran. It was a night to remember.";   Christian Okoye, who rushed for 130 yards
and set a team record with his 13th 100-yard game, turned two Buffalo
turnovers into two touchdowns less than two minutes apart in the third quarter
for a 30-6 lead.;   Okoye reached the 100-yard rushing plateau for the 13th
time in his five-year career and passed Abner Haynes as the Chief with the
most 100-yard rushing games.;   Rookie Harvey Williams rushed for 103 yards.; 
 "By the time the fourth quarter rolled around, it was glorious," Maas said.; 
 "We gave them so many gifts, they should be happy until next Christmas," said
Kelly, who hit 17 of 23 passes for 189 yards.;   The Bills, who hadn't been
held without a TD since Dec. 4, 1988, suffered their worst defeat since a 47-6
loss to Indianapolis by replacement players during the 1987 strike. Derrick
Thomas had four of the Chiefs' sacks, with two of them causing fumbles.;   "We
believed in each other," Thomas said. "We thought we could get the job done.";
  The Bills still were in the game when Thurman Thomas took a pass from Jim
Kelly deep in Buffalo territory and was immediately hit by Lonnie Marts, who
knocked the ball loose for Kevin Ross to scoop up and run 13 yards to the
Buffalo 17.;   One play later, Okoye went over for a 23-6 lead with 2 minutes,
52 seconds left in the third quarter. A moment later, Thomas sacked Kelly,
knocking the ball loose, and Dan Saleaumua recovered on the 11. On
fourth-and-goal from the 2, Okoye knocked a defender backward into the end
zone.;   A fumble by Don Beebe on the ensuing kickoff led to Nick Lowery's
22-yard field goal. Lowery also kicked a 41-yarder in the first quarter, a
40-yarder in the second and a 24-yarder in the third.;   Thomas, the Bills'
leading rusher, left the game late in the quarter with an apparent ankle
injury.;   Even the officiating went against the Bills. Officials placed the
ball 5 yards away from where they should have after replay officials
overturned a Buffalo pass completion in the third period.;   The Bills were
without All-Pro defensive end Bruce Smith, who is out with a knee injury. But
it was a miserable homecoming for Bills' Coach Marv Levy, who coached the
Chiefs from 1978-82.;   "If a team can succeed in running the ball as well as
they did, you're in for a long night," Levy said. "They just overpowered us. I
hope we're not as bad as we looked. I think most routs -- and this was a rout
-- are not indicative of the difference between the two teams.";   The Chiefs
won with a formula all teams attempt against Buffalo: Once you get the
football, hold on to it for long drives and eat the clock. Kansas City led in
plays (38-28) and in possession time (19 minutes 15 seconds to 10:45) as it
built a 13-6 halftime lead.;   The Chiefs scored on the game's first
possession on Lowery's 41-yard field goal.;   Then with 7:40 left in the
quarter, Kansas City tight end Jonathon Hayes, after a huge hit by linebacker
Darryl Talley, fumbled at the Chiefs' 31 and cornerback Nate Odomes recovered
for Buffalo.;   But Kansas City got the ball back with 5:46 left when Maas
knocked Kelly down and the ball loose at the Kansas City 23. Marts recovered
and Kansas City then drove 77 yards in 12 plays, featuring daring play-calling
with play-action passes near the Bills' goal line. Tight end Pete Holohan's
1-yard catch from Steve DeBerg gave the Chiefs a 10-0 lead with 14:16 left in
the half.;   Buffalo's only points came on a 44-yard field goal from Scott
Norwood in the second quarter, and then a 25-yarder after wasting a first down
on the Chiefs 11 after Okoye fumbled.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Thirty dusty days on the Jim Bridger Trail
ended in rain Monday as the Wyoming Centennial Wagon Train rolled
into Cody with modern-day pioneers who relived the past to
celebrate the state's 100th birthday.
   Approximately 200 wagons and 1,600 riders on horseback were
greeted with a great whooping and hollering from several thousand
well-wishers who jammed streets and roof tops to watch the
four-mile-long procession.
   ``I wouldn't have bet there were this many horses in this whole
United States,'' lifelong Cody resident Frank McJunkin, 70, said as
he watched the parade of covered wagons, horses and exhausted but
delighted riders ramble by.
   The cavalry led the wagon train to the end of its 260-mile trek
along the Jim Bridger Trail, one of the main pioneer routes
northwest through Wyoming. Riders recreating the Pony Express
followed with state centennial flags.
   U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, in a red Western shirt and beaded vest,
rode the last few miles with the wagon train and predicted that
years from now everyone will claim they rode along.
   ``There'll be as many people saying they rode the Wyoming
Centennial Wagon Train as said they saw Babe Ruth's last game at
Yankee Stadium _ about 7 million,'' said Simpson, who grew up in
this frontier town founded by showman Buffalo Bill Cody.
   Kayne Pyatt, the trail boss who oversaw the journey organized by
a group of enthusiasts, said, ``It's sort of like I've lived a
great childhood adventure, a fantasy. ... If I died tomorrow, I'd
be satisfied.''
   The riders started the day about 16 miles east of Cody and
followed alongside U.S. 14A, encountering a torrential downpour
about a mile out.
   Simpson and his wife, Ann, were joined on the final leg by
Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan and his wife, Jane, and Wyoming Rep.
Craig Thomas and his wife, Susan, all on horseback. Montana Gov.
Stan Stephens rode in a red surry.
   The sun broke through as they reached the edge of town, but
distant thunder and lightning added a dramatic backdrop. Horses
reared and bucked, riders waved and hollered and a few wagon
passengers played their fiddles to the Cody crowd.
   ``Cody loves you,'' some spectators yelled. ``Happy birthday
Wyoming!''
   Some of the trail riders welcomed the return to modern
conveniences, while others regretted reaching the end of the line.
   ``In a way, it's sad and in a way I'm glad to roll into Cody,''
said Ken Hagen, 71, of Roseau, Minn. ``The dust was the worst. Some
days, there was so much dust you couldn't see the team ahead of
you. And for six days, we never saw a tree.''
   The final miles brought together past and present, as modern-day
vehicles on the highway buzzed by the rumbling replica wagons.
   ``This is a chance for a person like me to be a part of history,
maybe not a significant part, but a part,'' said Mike Wozniak, of
Casper, who spent two days on the trail. ``This wagon train is not
going to happen again _ maybe not for another 100 years.''
   The train left Fort Caspar June 2. Besides the dust, it was
accompanied by fears the organizers wouldn't be able to pay their
bills.
   Arriving here, the organizers estimated they were about $100,000
shy of the approximately $500,000 they figured they'd need to pay
for things like hay, water and portable toilets.
   Participating costs ranged from $40 a day to just ride along in
your own rig, to $198 a day to ride on one provided.
   The organizers also raised money through contests and auctions
along the trail, and plan to raffle off an elk permit donated by
Gov. Mike Sullivan.

<LEADPARA>  As if Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas and Andre Reed weren't enough, the Buffalo
Bills added a new scoring weapon Monday night -- their defense.;   Three
turnovers produced 17 points, including a fumble return for a touchdown by
linebacker Cornelius Bennett, and the Bills beat the Miami Dolphins 41-27.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BILLS ROMP 41-27
DEFENSE KEYS WIN OVER MIAMI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Miami (5-6) lost to Buffalo (10-1) for the 10th time in 11 games.;   The
Bills mounted scoring drives of 83, 65, 72 and 89 yards. Thomas rushed for 135
yards and a touchdown in 23 carries. Kelly threw three touchdown passes -- two
to Reed and one to Thomas.;   Plenty of points;   The 41 points were the most
by Buffalo against Miami in a regular-season game since 1966. The Bills won
that one 58-24. Buffalo beat the Dolphins 44-34 in the playoffs last January.;
  Buffalo is accustomed to such production from its offense, ranked No. 1 in
the NFL. Big plays by the Bills' defense, ranked 26th, have been much less
frequent.;   The first and biggest turnover came when a blitzing Bennett
knocked the ball from Dan Marino's cocked right hand, fell on the fumble at
the 6-yard line, stood up and dashed into the end zone. That gave Buffalo the
lead for good at 17-10 in the second quarter.;   "It was a huge play," Bills
Coach Marv Levy said. "It really turned the momentum.";   Marino suffered
another costly turnover on the next play when his underthrown pass was
intercepted by Kirby Jackson and returned 12 yards to the Miami 24. Seven
plays later, Scott Norwood kicked a 21-yard field goal.;   Fumble sets up
score;   Miami rookie Aaron Craver fumbled the second-half kickoff, and
Buffalo's Hal Garner recovered at the 27. Kelly then hit Reed with a 5-yard TD
pass.;   The Dolphins finished with five turnovers, Buffalo none. With such
figures, Miami Coach Don Shula said, "there's just no way you're going to win
a game against a team with that kind of talent.";   Kelly and Reed connected
from 23 yards for the Bills' final TD.;   Miami's Sammie Smith scored his
first touchdown of the season. Former Stanford tight end Greg Baty caught a
1-yard pass from Marino for his first TD since 1987.  </TEXT>

FT  25 JAN 92 / Sport: Bills seek their place in history - American Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARV LEVY, Harvard graduate, history buff and poetry lover, talks a mean
game of American football.
The silver-haired head coach of the Buffalo Bills analyses the strategies
and tactics of the sport in a precise, elegant manner. His comments in press
conferences can come laced with literary allusions. He uses words like
'inculcate' and 'salient' in pre-game meetings with his team.
Tomorrow in Minneapolis, however, the erudite Levy will leave the talking to
his players, who must play a mean game of football if they are to defeat the
Washington Redskins in Superbowl XXVI.
The Redskins start as favourites, and are expected to win by at least seven
points according to the bookmakers in Las Vegas. Yet for those of us who
have enjoyed watching the Bills this season, it is difficult to think of
them as underdogs.
Under Levy, Buffalo has set the National Football League alight in the past
two seasons with a rapid-fire passing and running game which led the team to
a host of high scoring victories.
At the root of their success is the 'no-huddle' offense - a tactic that
dispenses with the huddle before each play and allows the quarterback to
call his own moves. At its best, the no-huddle offense puts points on the
board quickly and leaves opposing defenses scrambling to keep up with the
pace.
At the heart of the Bills attack are two great players, quarterback Jim
Kelly and all-purpose running back Thurman Thomas. Kelly is an experienced
leader with a sharp tactical brain and a strong arm, while Thomas is a
superb all-rounder, a quicksilver runner and an acrobatic receiver.
Powered by Kelly and Thomas, and supported by receivers James Lofton and
Andre Reed, the Bills topped the statistical tables in a number of key
attacking categories this season, including most total yards gained and most
touchdowns scored.
So with all their offensive firepower, why aren't the Bills favourites to
win?
There are two reasons, and both come down to defense. The Redskins' defense
is strong, against both the running and the passing game, and it ranks third
best in the league for overall effectiveness.
Washington's defense is especially good at 'blitzing' the quarterback - in
the 16 regular games this season they reached opposing quarterbacks and
sacked them 50 times. Kelly has looked vulnerable to the sack in the past,
particularly two weekends ago when the Denver Broncos' blitzed relentlessly,
giving Kelly insufficient time to get his no-huddle offense into gear.
The fragility of their own defense, which ranked next-to-last in the league
this season, is the second reason why the Bills are not favourites tomorrow.
They have shown an improvement in the playoffs (holding Denver to just seven
points in the AFC Championship game), thanks partly to the return of two
powerful players, slashing defensive end Bruce Smith and bulldozing nose
tackle Jeff Wright.
Yet in the Redskins, the Bills defense will be facing one of the toughest
offensive lines in football. This is where the 'Hogs' come in. Hogs is the
collective nickname for the enormous front-line that defends Redskins'
quarterback Mark Rypien.
Not only are the Hogs good at giving Rypien time to throw long passes to
receivers Art Monk, Gary Clark and Ricky Sanders (the protection has been so
effective that Rypien was sacked just nine times all season), but they are
also adept at knocking holes in defensive lines for backs Ernest Byner,
Ricky Ervins and Gerald Riggs to run through.
One big advantage the Redskins have is the versatility of their attack. The
Bills rely heavily, perhaps too heavily, on Thomas's all-round skills. Stop
Thomas, and Buffalo usually struggles.
Washington's three running backs possess different strengths and styles
providing a balance of power and precision. The trio of fleet wide receivers
spread defenses and regularly break open for long yardage. The variety of
attacking options available to Redskins coach Joe Gibbs helps explain why
his team was the highest-scoring unit in the NFL this season.
Yet, as any fan of sports cliches knows, statistics and history mean little
when it comes to one Big Game. The difference may ultimately lie in
motivation, and how badly each team wants to win.
In this respect, the Bills could have the edge. It has been 363 days since
Scott Norwood's potential game-winning kick sailed wide of the right hand
goalpost in the closing seconds of Superbowl XXV against the New York
Giants, and the determination of the Bills to avenge that loss burns just as
bright as it did a year ago.
Both teams have prepared thoroughly, but Buffalo seem to have gone about
their business amid the outrageous hype and publicity of Superbowl week in a
quieter, more purposeful manner.
And while less than half of the Redskins are survivors from the team's last
Superbowl appearance in 1987, the Bills squad is much the same as it was
last year. The memories of that game are still fresh for Jim Kelly, Thurman
Thomas, and Bruce Smith. My money is on Buffalo to win by three points,
courtesy of kicker Scott Norwood.

Three fumbles in the game's first seven minutes Sunday gave Indianapolis Colt 
Coach Ron Meyer a mountainous problem. 
</P>
<P>
"As I said coming in, it looks like a very steep hill," Meyer said in reference 
to Indianapolis' playoff chances after a 30-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills. "It 
looks like Mount Everest right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts (4-6) are three games behind the first-place Bills (7-3) in the race 
for the AFC East title and two games behind second-place Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"It is best when you control your own destiny," Colts' offensive tackle Chris 
Hinton said. "But now we have to win the rest of our games and we also need 
some help from other teams if we are going to catch Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
The game's turning point may have come on the opening kickoff, when Mark Pike 
ripped the ball out of Indianapolis returner James Pruitt's hands. Mickey 
Sutton recovered for Buffalo on the Colt 22-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"That fumble was a big emotional lift for us," Sutton said. "Both teams came 
out all psyched up and that play set the tone for the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kelly took advantage of the mistake, connecting with Thurman Thomas for the 
first of Kelly's three touchdown passes on the day with only 2:12 gone in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
That fumble was forced by a hard hit. The Colts, especially running back Eric 
Dickerson, had no such excuse on the fumbles that ended their next two 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Smith recovered Dickerson's first fumble, giving Buffalo the ball at 
midfield, and Scott Norwood kicked a 42-yard field goal to make it 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Dickerson, who didn't talk to 
reporters after the game, fumbled again when the ball bounced off his knee. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills turned that into a 40-yard field goal by Norwood for a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown passes of 32 and three yards from Kelly to Andre Reed in the second 
quarter made it 27-0 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills rushed for 232 yards in 51 carries. Thomas had 127 yards in 29 
attempts.

<TEXT>     The Bills won't use it all the time or even most of the time. Their routine
is to strike quickly, keeping the defense off balance, grabbing control of the
game's tempo. That's what they did in a 51-3 rout of the Raiders on Sunday.;  
 That's exactly what they would like to do against the NFC champ New York
Giants. After all, scoring early is becoming a habit. The Bills have scored on
their first possession in nine of their past 12 games. Given that jump start,
they have scored a total of 95 points in two playoff games.;    "Once the
opponent sees us score so quickly on the first drive, which we've been doing a
lot lately, I think it gives our defense a psychological advantage," said
Buffalo running back Thurman Thomas. "Now the other team is thinking that we
came out in a no-huddle and came right down and scored. It's a big morale
boost. People we play start thinking we can go up and down the field all
day.";    It was used against Bills;  The ironic part of the no-huddle offense
is that it was used effectively by the Cincinnati Bengals against the Bills
during the 1988 AFC championship game. Buffalo Coach Marv Levy protested
loudly before the game about the propriety of the no-huddle, where plays are
called at the line of scrimmage and defenses are not afforded time to make
adjustments.;    Cincinnati won the game 21-10 and went to the Super Bowl. Now
Levy has used it to reach the Super Bowl.;    "They've been successful with
it," noted Giants defensive lineman Leonard Marshall. "They make you play a
lot of plays in a hurry. After so long playing that no-huddle, fatigue sets
in.;    "The key is to recognize the formation, remember your keys and make a
play. Once a play is over, you have to forget about it and get ready for the
next one. You don't have time to change up for different situations.";   
Buffalo used the no-huddle offense some during a 17-13 regular-season victory
over the Giants on Dec. 15. New York was able to learn from that game. The
Giants believe they can recognize what the Bills want to do from certain
formations, for instance, when they might run a crossing pattern with wide
receiver Andre Reed.;    Raiders tried a timeout;  There are a few ways to
break the momentum of the no-huddle. One is fake an injury. Another is call a
timeout, as L.A. did less than two minutes into Sunday's game.;    "They
looked like they needed one," said Marshall. "We know if we don't prepare
correctly, Buffalo could put up a basketball score against us, too.";   
Preparation, say the Giants, is only half the battle. Reacting to what they
see on the field is the rest.;    "First you have to make sure you have
everybody lined up," said linebacker Carl Banks. "Second, you have to have
your signals called. Third, you have to have your defensive linemen down. If
they're standing up looking for a call, it's all over.";    The no-huddle
offense has one drawback. It takes practically no time off the clock. The
Bills' first touchdown came in 3 1/2 minutes.;    But that is a small price to
pay for momentum.;    New York Coach Bill Parcells is less worried about the
philosophy than the personnel.;    "It's not what they're doing, it's who's
doing it," Parcells said. "The no-huddle is a nice, vogue thing to write
about. But their offense is Andre Reed and Thurman Thomas and Jim Kelly. Those
are the guys you have to stop. You don't stop the no-huddle.;    "You stop
their wide receivers, and they can't throw. You stop their runners and they
can't run."  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE>  BUFFALO ROLLS PAST CHICAGO
KELLY KEYS BILLS' SECOND-HALF SURGE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The NFL / Week 5; Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Kelly threw for 303 yards and three touchdowns and the Bills came back from
a sluggish first half to score 35 points in the final 32 minutes to beat the
Chicago Bears 35-20 in a battle of undefeated NFL teams.;   "When the clock is
running down on us, it seems to get us going," center Kent Hull said. "It's an
offense that seems to thrive under pressure and not do so well when there
isn't much.";   There wasn't much pressure at the start for the Bills, who had
scored 87 points in two home wins, then just 41 in two victories on the road.;
  In the first 28 minutes they had the ball for just six minutes, had 38 yards
on offense and were lucky to be trailing 6-0 -- the Bears had two touchdowns
called back by penalties and had to settle for Kevin Butler field goals of 28
and 42 yards.;   In the last 32 minutes, the Bills had the ball for 19 minutes
and rolled up 381 yards.;   It started with 1 minute, 59 seconds left in the
first half and Buffalo on its own 15.;   The Bills were in the end zone 1:47
later, the result of a 33-yard strike from Kelly to Al Edwards. That gave the
Bills a largely undeserved 7-6 lead, setting them off on an offensive
explosion that improved them to 5-0 and dropped Chicago to 4-1;   "We got our
butts beat, that is all you can say about it," Chicago coach Mike Ditka said.
"We had a number of chances in the game and we seemed to self-destruct every
chance we had. I give them all the credit in the world.";   The defending AFC
champion Bills (5-0) have won 12 games in a row, including the playoffs, at
home. Their last loss at Rich Stadium was in November, 1989.;   "They are a
fine football team; they taught us a little lesson," Ditka said. "Hopefully,
when you are in football, you learn from the lessons that are taught to you,
and you carry on from there.";   The Bills drove 91 yards for a touchdown to
open the second half -- Carwell Gardner's fourth-down recovery of his own
fumble from a yard out in the end zone. The drive started with runs of 12, 9
and 19 by Thurman Thomas, who got 90 of his 117 rushing yards after
intermission.;   "We didn't expect them to run like that," Chicago linebacker
Ron Rivera said. "They ended the first half throwing the ball and we thought
that would be their mode of operation coming out.";   Kelly agreed, saying the
key was a misdirection play which set Thomas free for those first three runs.;
  "Thurman opened it up," Kelly said. "We had a couple of running plays we
didn't use in the first half. The misdirection was one of them."; BILLS 35,
BEARS 20;   (box) THE HERO: Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly threw for 303 yards
and three touchdowns, and the Bills scored 35 points in the final 32 minutes.;
  (box) THE GOAT: Bears quarterback Jim Harbaugh, who completed only 6 of 16
passes in the second half.;   (box) KEY PLAY: Trailing 6-0 after being
completely outplayed for the first 29-plus minutes, the Bills took the lead
for good on a 33-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to Al Edwards with 12 seconds
remaining in the first half.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Actually, L.T. was just fooling around, but a lot of folks in Jersey would
probably give you a good argument about his ability to step in wherever he is
needed.;  DON'T DARE BE LATE; Buffalo Coach Marv Levy was quizzed about the
various ways he may approach the Giants in Sunday's Super Bowl.;    Levy
referred to remarks he said were made before a bout between legendary
heavyweight champion Joe Louis and challenger Billy Conn:;    "When they asked
Billy, he talked about how he was going to bob and weave and everything else
he planned to do," Levy said. "Then they asked Joe Louis, who said, 'I'll be
there, and I'll be on time.' Well, that's what we're going to do. We'll be
there, and we'll be on time.";  THE THRILL OF IT ALL; New York Giants Coach
Bill Parcells, asked to recall the most memorable moment from his team's first
trip to the Super Bowl in 1987, said it was waiting to take the field. The
game, in which the Giants defeated Denver 39-20, was played in Pasadena's Rose
Bowl.;    "I think probably the thing most difficult to explain to anyone is
the thrill of standing in that tunnel waiting to go out . . . and feeling that
exhilaration that comes over you, the feeling that, for one day, you're on
center stage.";  THAT'S A WRAP; Let the quarterback controversy begin.;   
Asked whether injured Phil Simms or super backup Jeff Hostetler would be his
starting quarterback next season, Parcells said, "We'll see in training camp.
I go by what I see. I'll play the best guys." . . .;    Parcells had his
running backs practice wearing uniform numbers in the 90s Thursday to foil any
potential spies. Asked what he would have them wear Friday, Parcells said,
smiling, "They're wearing all blanks today. Think that's a sign of paranoia?"
. . .;    The Bills had their first curfew of any kind Thursday, which Levy
said was a 12:30 a.m. "honor" curfew. He said he had no idea if anyone missed
it. The Bills' curfew for Friday and tonight is 11 p.m.;  AMERICA'S FAVORITE

would be complete without a poll of celebrities. So, here goes:;    Morganna
Roberts, the entertainer who made a career out of running out onto playing
fields and kissing athletes:;    "Sure, I know who's in the Super Bowl -- the
Bills and Giants. I'm praying for the Giants because Lawrence Taylor and I did
a card show together and he's a very nice man. But I've known Jim Kelly for
years. He used to come see me when I danced in a club in Houston and he was
with the Houston Gamblers (of the USFL). He's such a nice person. So I guess
I'll have to root for the Bills.";    Cal Ripken, Baltimore Orioles
shortstop:;    "Buffalo, 17-10. The Bills are playing so well, they remind you
of the 49ers. . . . But if there's one thing that could stop Buffalo, it would
be a good defense like the Giants.";    Andie MacDowell, actress-model:;   
"I'm proud of both the teams from my adopted home state, but it will
definitely be the Buffalo Bills by at least 10 points. Their offense is too
much and they have a really sound defense anchored by No. 78. I can't remember
his name, but he's great.";    Johnny Bench, former Cincinnati catcher:;    "I
like Buffalo because the Bills can score. The offense of the Giants has
revolved around their defense. Buffalo scored 95 points in two weeks and you
might think that 21 points will win the Super Bowl. I think Buffalo has shown
it can score 21 points easier than the Giants.";    Dr. Ruth Westheimer, sex
therapist: "The Giants will win because of the momentum they got in their big
win against San Francisco.";    Charles Grodin, actor:;    "I believe the
Giants will win the Super Bowl, because those of us who live in New York City
don't need anymore bad news.";    Jim Leyland, Pittsburgh Pirates manager:;   
"Buffalo, 16-13. I'm a little nervous about that pick because the Giants have
been there before. But Thurman Thomas will be the difference because he can
run and catch so well he will keep Lawrence Taylor and the Giants defense off
balance.";    Eddie Murray, Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman:;    "I don't
want to make Lawrence Taylor mad, but Buffalo's offense and defense is really
on a roll. Without a two-week layoff, they will continue to roll. The Giant
defense is tough, but I'd rather have my No. 1 quarterback (Jim Kelly) than a
backup (Jeff Hostetler) in the big game.";    Dick Vitale, sportscaster:;   
"Buffalo 24-17. Jim Kelly -- too tough. Bruce Smith -- best defensive player
in football. Move over Lawrence Taylor, baa-bee. It's not your day today.";   
Scott Hamilton, ice skater:;    "I would say Buffalo. They've been the
wretched refugees in the NFL for too long, and an AFC team hasn't won a Super
Bowl in a while. It's time.";    Larry King, talk show host:;    "Buffalo
23-10 in a very good game. I pick Buffalo because they finished the season as
the absolute best team in football. They're a team that comes along once in a
blue moon. Besides, I picked them to win the Super Bowl before the season
began.";    Beano Cook, TV analyst:;    "New York Giants 42, Buffalo Bills 10.
If the 49ers show up, San Francisco 49, Buffalo 10. The AFC is still the Ivy
League of pro football.";    Jerry Mathers, TV child star:;    "I got wiped

it would be the Giants.";    Toni Tennille, singer:;    "When the Niners were
out of it, I kind of lost interest. Probably the Bills.";     Dr. Joyce
Brothers, psychologist:;    "The Giants are going to win without question;
reason being that they have an excellent defense. Additionally, the Giants
play a slowdown game and keep running the clock, and there is nothing that
drives people bananas as much as that. Understand, Americans tend to be
action-oriented, and a great psychological defense is slowing down the game.
Also, Buffalo is not good on the road, and they're going to be disoriented,
though not as disoriented as they'll be by the slow tempo."OK, that's it. Stop
the music, stop the music.  </TEXT>

The New England Patriots have had plenty of practice coming from behind. For 
once, they got it right. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie cornerback Maurice Hurst put the Patriots ahead to stay on a 16-yard 
interception return with 2:49 left as New England scored 20 points in the last 
eight minutes Sunday to beat the Buffalo Bills, 33-24. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably our largest play of the year," Hurst said. "I thought first 
about catching it and then when I saw the end zone I just couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots turned two mistakes by Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly into the 
decisive points. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst's touchdown on a pass by Kelly gave the Patriots (4-7) a 30-24 lead and 
Jason Staurovsky added a clinching 38-yard field goal after New England 
recovered a fumble by Kelly at the Patriot 31. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo (7-4) fell into a tie for the AFC East lead with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Patriots overcame a 24-12 fourth-quarter deficit to take a 
26-24 lead over the New York Jets, only to lose, 27-26, on Pat Leahy's 
final-play field goal. A week ago, they nearly erased a 28-10 deficit with two 
touchdowns in the last four minutes but lost to New Orleans, 28-24. 
</P>
<P>
"We know any time we play them we're in a fight," Kelly said. "We know they can 
come back. We know what kind of a quarterback Steve Grogan is." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly completed 21 of 41 passes for 356 yards, one touchdown and two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
After Buffalo took a 24-13 lead on Larry Kinnebrew's one-yard touchdown run and 
Thurman Thomas' 25-yard scoring pass from Kelly, Grogan began the comeback with 
a 14-yard touchdown pass to Hart Lee Dykes with 7:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
Staurovsky's 34-yard field goal made it 24-23 with 3:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
New England snapped a two-game losing streak with a season-best 192-yard ground 
attack, led by John Stephens' 126 yards in 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots erased a 10-6 halftime deficit on a 15-yard scoring run by rookie 
Patrick Egu on his first NFL carry. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo took a 7-0 lead on its first series of the game on Thomas' three-yard 
run. Staurovsky kicked field goals of 34 and 24 yards, cutting the lead to 7-6 
with 7:04 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills' Scott Norwood kicked a 31-yard field goal with 35 seconds left in 
the first half.

<TEXT>     But before the victory in Super Bowl XXV was locked up, they had to survive
a 47-yard field-goal attempt by the Bills' Scott Norwood, whose chance to be a
hero went wide right with eight seconds to play.;    On their way to victory,
the Giants broke records both very old and very new.;    The old:;    (check)
The one-point victory broke the record for narrowest margin of victory, three
points, set in Super Bowl V.;    The new:;    (check) Their ground-hugging
offense held the ball for 40 minutes, 33 seconds of the 60-minute contest,
breaking the 49ers' possession record (39:31) set in Super Bowl XXIV. And
their third-quarter touchdown drive that lasted 9:29 and ended with a 1-yard
dive by Anderson set the record for longest TD drive. The previous mark, 7:07,
had been set by the Niners, too.;    "Those drives were real important,
because it kept their offense off the field and, just as importantly, it kept
their defense on it," said cornerback Mark Collins. "They're not used to being
on the field for that long. You could see it on those long drives that they
were getting tired.";    "We're not pretty, but we're effective," said
Anderson, who carried 21 times for 102 yards and one TD.;    Any talk before
the game about a fatigue factor involved the Giants' defense. Expectations
were that the Bills' no-huddle offense would run the Giants' 3-4 defense
ragged.;    Maybe it would have. Defensive coordinator Bill Belichick didn't
want to find out, so he switched to a nickel defense and had defensive back
Everson Walls calling defensive audibles to match any from Bills quarterback
Jim Kelly.;    "We wanted to have more speed and better athletes on the
field," Belichick explained. "We thought their big-play guys would be James
Lofton, Andre Reed and Thurman Thomas. . . . Everson did a hell of a job. He
called it better than I could have.";    Despite all that, the Bills, heavily
favored after scoring 95 points in their two playoff games, still could have
pulled it out. An 11-yard run by Thomas had put the ball on the Giants' 29,
where Kelly spiked the ball to stop the clock with eight seconds left and give
the Bills a chance to bring on Norwood.;    "Everything was fine with
placement," Norwood said. "It was a matter of trying to put a little too much
on the kick.";    Giants place-kicker Matt Bahr, who had put his team in the
Super Bowl by making a last-second field goal from 42 yards in the NFC
championship game against the 49ers, sympathized.;    "That's a difficult kick
in any conditions," Bahr said. "It was more nerve wracking to be on the
sidelines. Everything was a blur. I didn't really watch it. When I saw
(cornerback) Roger Brown jumping up and down, I knew it had missed.";   
Giants defensive end Leonard Marshall didn't see it either, because he was
lost in thinking back over the last three months.;    "I thought about
everything," he said. "I thought about beating Detroit 20-0 and only beating
New England 13-10 and having everyone say we weren't going to make it. I
thought about beating Chicago, training camp, all the different snaps.";    He
didn't mention the Giants' 17-13 loss to the Bills in the regular season. But
sloppy tackling, the same problem that plagued the Giants when they lost to
the Bills during the regular season, cost them a 17-12 lead at the start of
the fourth quarter.;    Thomas, on the first play of the quarter, shed
linebacker Gary Reasons and safety Myron Guyton on his way to a 31-yard
touchdown run. Norwood's extra point made it 19-17, Bills.;    But the Giants
came back with another time-consuming drive, using up 7:32 as they went from
their 23 to the Buffalo 3. Bahr kicked a 21-yard field goal that gave them a
20-19 lead with 7:20 left.;    The Bills had several chances to break the game
open in the first half and led 12-3 at one point, but the Giants drove 87
yards near the end of the half for a score on Hostetler's 14-yard pass to
Stephen Baker with 25 seconds left.;    The Giants' win was the seventh
straight for the NFC in the Super Bowl.;  GIANTS' TIME-EATING DRIVES; The New
York Giants' ability to keep the ball out of the hands of the potent Buffalo
Bills' offense and to score on time-consuming drives played a major role in
the outcome of Super Bowl XXV. The scoring drives:;  Plays   Yards Time
Result; 11     58    6:15 Field goal by Bahr; 10     87    3:24 Touchdown pass
to Baker; 14     75    9:29 Anderson touchdown run; 14     74    7:23 Field
goal by Bahr;  Ran in the South County Edition only; ...;  THE VALUE OF TIME; 
One major reason the New York Giants controlled the ball for 21 minutes, 6
seconds more than the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV is that they not only
ran 16 more plays than the Bills, but also averaged slightly more than 13
seconds more per play than Buffalo. That means, on the average, Giants plays
lasted 1.6 times longer than Bills plays. Here's a look at the numbers:; ...;

<P>
Warren Moon and Jim Kelly played to a virtual standoff, but the Houston Oilers 
surprisingly had the edge when it came to Lorenzo White and Thurman Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
White had his career-best game for rushing and receiving yardage Monday night, 
leading the Oilers past the Buffalo Bills, 27-24, and completing a week in 
which all six NFL division leaders lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line was ferocious and unrelenting," White said. "It takes a 
while for the line in this system to get used to the run. Once I get the hole I 
can create things. It was just like it's drawn up on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Houston (6-5) created a three-way tie with Cincinnati and Pittsburgh for the 
AFC Central lead, while the Bills (9-2), whose eight-game losing streak was 
ended, dropped into a tie for the AFC East lead with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
White rushed 18 times for 125 yards and caught five passes for 89 yards. His 
previous best rushing total was 113 and his best receiving was 82, both last 
season. Thomas was held to 54 yards in 15 carries and caught four passes for 32 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in pass defense most of the night," Pardee said. "They had six guys 
back and five up front. You have to be able to count. We got White going." 
</P>
<P>
White, who has taken heat for his fumbles and lack of production this season, 
"was wired tight," Pardee said. 
</P>
<P>
Moon's 28-yard pass to White positioned the Oilers for a three-yard scoring 
pass to Leonard Harris, giving Houston a 27-17 lead with 7:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
"White was fantastic," Moon said. "He knew he was going to be called upon the 
way they were dropping people back." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas scored on a two-yard run with 3:29 left to trim Houston's lead, but the 
Oilers ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Moon completed 16 of 22 passes for 300 yards and two touchdowns; Kelly was 23 
of 34 for 224 yards and two scores. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it would be a matter of who had the ball last," Kelly said. "We had 
confidence we could score again. But give them credit." 
</P>
<P>
Moon's 43-yard pass to Drew Hill set up White's one-yard run with 3:14 left in 
the third quarter to give the Oilers a 20-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills weren't overly complimentary of White. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're split out like we were, a baby could run through the holes," 
cornerback Nate Odomes said. "I don't mean to take anything away from Lorenzo. 
My hat is off to him." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly gave the Bills a 14-13 lead by hitting Keith McKeller with an 11-yard 
scoring pass 40 seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Norwood's 43-yard field goal made it 17-13 on Buffalo's first possession 
of the third quarter.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Bills on a Stampede Toward Minneapolis
   ----
   By Frederick C. Klein
</HL>
<DATE>
01/07/92
</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A8
</SO>
<LP>
   Orchard Park, N.Y. -- The question of who wants to spend a
late-January week in Minneapolis was bound to arise as the
National Football League playoffs unfolded, and last weekend
four volunteers stepped forward. In the National Conference,
the Washington Redskins slogged through home-field muck to
beat the Atlanta Falcons, and the upstart Detroit Lions
survived the air conditioning of their Pontiac Silverdome
against the Dallas Cowboys. In the American Conference, John
Elway again walked on figurative water to give his Denver
Broncos a chance for a Super Bowl trip to the big Metrodome
igloo, and the Buffalo Bills bashed the Kansas City Chiefs on
a chilly, graywrapped Sunday here.
   Of the four winners, none made a more emphatic statement
of their intention to be Minny-bound than the Bills. Their
victory over the Chiefs was by a 37-14 score in a game in
which the last quarter-and-a-half was a mere formality.
Moments after Jim Kelly, the thick-necked quarterback, found
James Lofton, the long-legged receiver, with a 10-yard
touchdown pass to make it 24-0 three minutes into period
three, 11 folks in the east stand of crowded Rich Stadium
cheerily arose holding big red letters spelling out
"MINNEAPOLIS." It is tempting to insert a Buffalo joke here,
but, given other circumstances, fans in Miami or L.A. would
be glad to be in the shoes of the Buffaloans, even if they
are fur-lined.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Bills, you'll recall, were a Super Bowl visitor last
year. They lost to the New York Giants, 20-19, when a field
goal try by their Scott Norwood went awry. That was in toasty
Tampa, Fla., the sort of tropical venue usually selected for
those affairs. But the boys from Nickel City will be glad to
swap a chance at a tan for a trophy this time around. "Yeah,
we know where the game is; we've been pointing for it all
season," said Cornelius Bennett, a Buffalo linebacker. "We
can go someplace warm after we win." To be sure, that will
take some doing in a saga that resumes with the AFC final
here Sunday. The Bills' foe will be Denver, which gave the
Houston Oilers Broncoitis with an 87-yard, no-timeouts-left
drive to set up a last-play field goal and 26-24 victory.
Elway, the Denver quarterback, engineers such miracles
routinely, a fact that's well known to the Bills. "The
difference between Elway and DeBerg and Vlasic {the Chief
QBs} is like night and day," said Leon Seals, an undiplomatic
but accurate Buffalo defensive lineman.
   But as they've amply displayed all season, the Bills have
quite a few assets of their own, including a state-of-the-art
offense that was No. 1 in yards and No. 2 in points over the
regular campaign. They run and shoot from the spread out,
multireceiver formation of the same name, and do it quick,
sans huddles. In the process, they've debunked the curious
but widespread notion that owning the ball over long periods
(the stat is called "time of possession") is somehow
important in the great scheme of things.
   Marv Levy, the sometime scholar who coaches this crew (he
holds a master's degree in English history from the U. of
Chicago), says the magic isn't in how you line up but in what
you do thereafter, and the Bills are solvent there, too. In
QB Kelly, they have a strong-armed type who is now, in his
sixth NFL (and eighth pro) season, strong-minded as well,
able to change plays nimbly at the line of scrimmage. In
sure-footed Thurman Thomas, they have the league's best
all-purpose back, with the stats to prove it. And in the
veterans Lofton, Andre Reed and Don Beebe, they have swift
receivers who are difficult to pass, as in exceed. "It's hard
to cover any of us one-on-one, and, on most plays, somebody
has to do that," noted Reed, who caught passes worth 1,113
yards this term.
   Jayice Pearson, a Kansas City cornerback, found himself
trying to guard Reed one-on-one twice in the first half
Sunday, and both times wound up watching Reed's No. 83
recede. The first touchdown pass Reed caught covered 25
yards, the second 53, and they put the Chiefs in permanent
arrears.
   "We caught them in the wrong coverage at the wrong time,"
grinned Reed. That happened a lot on a day in which Kelly
completed 23 of 35 passes for 273 yards, and Thomas's rushing
yardage totaled a round 100.
   The other team gets the ball once in awhile too, and the
last time these two teams met, in Kansas City on Oct. 7, the
Chiefs did very well with it. They have the NFL's most
predictable offense, preferring to run straight ahead under
most circumstances, but sometimes it works, and it did for
247 yards rushing in a 33-6 Chief win. And, in fact, the
Bills' defense has been suspect generally, ranking 27th among
the league's 28 clubs.
   But injuries -- especially one to Bruce Smith, their
massive defensive lineman -- played a role in that showing,
and Smith was back Sunday, albeit with continuing difficulty
from a sore knee. Whatever, KC could run for just 77 yards
this time, and the Bills intercepted four passes thrown by
young QB Mark Vlasic, who replaced the veteran Steve DeBerg
after the latter sprained his thumb on the helmet of a Bill
lineman. The Chiefs could not advance into Buffalo territory
until they did so via an intercepted pass late in period
three, and trailed by 30, 37-7, at one point.
   The early season loss to the Chiefs was one of just three
inflicted upon the Bills this season (they have won 14), but
Coach Levy said afterward that advancement, not revenge, was
their prime motivation on Sunday. He adjudged their overall
performance to be their best of the season, and said he
believed it stemmed from the "heightened degree of perception
and awareness" that playoff football inspires.
   If he talks like that to the Bills, and they understand
it, there's no telling how far they can go. Certainly as far
as Minneapolis.

   Russell Springs, Kan. -- The two hunters left the warmth
of the campfire in the grove of towering cottonwoods and
stepped out onto the vastness of the native prairie. A
serpentine path led them around the pointed leaves of yucca
cactus, around brittle sagebrush and impenetrable clusters of
tumbleweed.
   As they walked across the calm, sundrenched grassland I
noticed that one of the pair was shaking. "Cold?" I asked.
"No," he replied, "excited to be here." Not a sportsman in
the world could blame him.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Kansas prairie that surrounded him is home to some of
America's most magnificent whitetail and mule deer. Where the
habitat is right there are antelopes, wild turkeys and
countless coveys of quails and pheasants. Without a doubt,
it's some of the finest game country that can be found today.
   Yet the hunters were looking for a hunt of the past rather
than the present. The short walk that took them to the top of
a small rise, in a way, took them back a dozen decades or
more. It was then that they saw it -- a half-ton, humpbacked
animal cloaked in a thick brown and chestnut coat, wearing a
pair of short, ebony horns on its massive head.
   A stalk was planned and the hunters were off. Though
unusual in modern times, a buffalo hunt is something that the
plains above the Smokey Hill River had seen countless times
through the centuries.
   "This used to be some of the finest buffalo country in
America," said Wilbur Williams, as he looked out over the
prairies of his Smoky River Buffalo Ranch, which offers
guided hunting expeditions. The main season runs from
November through March. "They were here in the millions; old
accounts tell of herds stretching as far as the eye could
see."
   And according to Mr. Williams, a self-trained naturalist
and historian, the vast herd attracted a variety of hunters
throughout the centuries. While roaming the ranch as both a
boy and a man, Mr. Williams has found tools and weapons from
such past hunters as the Pawnee, Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.
   The grounds that now make up his buffalo ranch were
utilized by white hunters as well. Trappers headed for the
mountains and travelers headed for the promise of California
or Oregon relied on the buffalo for a source of food. Those
who followed, however, relied on them as a source for
money-making hides.
   "This area was at the heart of the big buffalo-hunting era
of the late 1860s and 1870s," said Mr. Williams. "There was a
lot of history made around here. Bill Cody and Bill Comstock
had their famous buffalo-hunting contest just north of here
to see who could use the name Buffalo Bill. And over the
years I've found at least two shoe boxes full of old
cartridges left behind by the hide hunters."
   The original herds and the hide hunters disappeared
roughly a century ago. A lifelong love of the big animals
caused Mr. Williams to bring them back. With a careful
breeding program and supplementation, the native Kansan has
reestablished a self-sustaining herd here. And the hunters
have returned, hunting an experience, trying to relive a life
of old.
   "The main reason I came was to fulfill a lifelong dream,"
said Darrell Wuertz, one of the pair of hunters. "Ever since
I was little I dreamed about walking the ground where the
buffalo lived and taking one with a black-powder rifle in the
way that the mountain men would have so many years ago. For
someone like me, just being here is worth the drive from
Indiana."
   That weekend eight hunters from a halfdozen states had
traveled to Mr. Williams's ranch for the same reasons as Mr.
Wuertz. All but one hunted with replicas of original
percussion or flintlock muzzleloaders, most of which they'd
built with their own hands. Some even walked the plains in
buckskin clothing.
   Other groups have pitched tepees and camped among the
cottonwoods. Mr. Williams contributes to the realism by
serving meals of buffalo around an open campfire. He and his
assistants wear dress of the period, and hunters who choose
to can hunt with one of Mr. Williams's original Sharps
"buffalo rifles."
   No matter what the gun of choice, those who come meet with
success. Though an animal of surprising quickness and speed,
the buffalo has never been as challenging as, say, whitetail
deer. The two hunters eventually were able to sneak within
range in the midst of the expansive prairie. Roy English was
first to fire and Mr. Wuertz was quick to add a humane
insurance shot.
   But the day was far from over for Messrs. English and
Wuertz. They, Mr. Williams and an associate labored far into
the afternoon. When they were done they had the skin removed
and readied to be made into a massive buffalo robe. More
importantly, the meat was trimmed and ready for the trip back
to Indiana.
   "That's another big reason why we came," said Mr. English.
"We're going to be taking home meat and you can bet we're
going to use it all."
   The two hunters will not only be eating a lot, they'll
also be eating well. According to Mr. Williams, the
three-year-old bull will produce close to 500 pounds of
superbly delicious meat. As an added bonus, it's a meat that
the hunters can feast on to their heart's content. "Buffalo
is a meat that's high in protein but very lean," said Mr.
Williams. "It's not zero-percent cholesterol, but it's much
less than beef. It's a very healthy meat."

QBS FALL IN BILLS' VICTORY;

PRO FOOTBALL: BUFFALO HOLDS OFF GIANTS, 17-13, AFTER INJURIES TO SIMMS AND 
KELLY.

<P>
When they won the game in the first half, the Buffalo Bills looked like a San 
Francisco 49er team playing the no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Buffalo's best defensive player, Bruce Smith, resembling the 
old Lawrence Taylor, broke down the New York Giants' offense. 
</P>
<P>
Then both teams lost their quarterbacks -- possibly for the season -- whereupon 
the Bills hung on to get a 17-13 victory Saturday in a matchup that was billed 
in nearby Manhattan as a Super Bowl preview. 
</P>
<P>
It might not be remembered as that unless the two quarterbacks return. 
</P>
<P>
On a chilly, rainy day in Giants Stadium, Buffalo's Jim Kelly went down first, 
leaving late in the first half with damaged knee ligaments that could require 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be out three weeks unless I'm lucky," he kept saying. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, New York's Phil Simms went to the bench with a sprained 
arch, which, the doctors said, can be more serious than it sounds or looks. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that the Simms X-rays were negative," Giant Coach Bill 
Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
It was about the only good news the Giants had in the course of slipping to 
11-3 in the highly competitive NFC. They had entered December 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills advanced to 12-2 when they survived a second-half battle of backup 
quarterbacks, a struggle in which Buffalo's Frank Reich and New York's Jeff 
Hostetler moved their teams repeatedly though scoring only three points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
After Kelly had outplayed Simms in a 14-10 first half, Hostetler's 
third-quarter drive improved the Giants to 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
That put it up to Reich, who, on the game's next series, drove the Bills to the 
three points that got Buffalo in position to win, 17-13, unless Hostetler could 
take the Giants to a fourth-quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't his fault that he couldn't. On one possession he came down to the 
Buffalo 13, where, in shotgun formation on third down, Giant center Bart Oates 
took his club out of field goal range with a wild snap. 
</P>
<P>
Next, reaching the Buffalo 21 on a 17-yard pass to wide receiver Stephen Baker, 
Hostetler lost all that, and 10 yards more, on offensive pass interference 
against a decoy receiver who was across the field from Baker. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have had 10 opportunities to (win) this one and blew them all," 
Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
Giant linebacker Taylor, for example, was in position to score two touchdowns 
on intercepted passes. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't make the plays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus he was outplayed by Smith, Buffalo's 275-pound defensive end, who had 
promised he would. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't knocking Taylor last week when I said I'm better than he is," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"My full statement was this: Over the last 10 years, Taylor was the most 
dominant defensive player in the game. This season, I have emerged to be the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
On Taylor's own turf, it looked that way. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills, however, have played good defense for years. What's different about 
this team is that it's also playing good offense. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Marv Levy and his offensive coordinator, Ted Marchibroda, have given 
Buffalo a well-structured short-passing attack that resembles San Francisco's. 
In fact, it proved more successful against New York than San Francisco's -- 
which had been held to one touchdown Dec. 3 in the 49ers' 7-3 victory over the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
There were two reasons for that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most Buffalo plays were dispatched from no-huddle formations that kept the 
Giants off balance throughout most of Kelly's time on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Bills' main ballcarrier, Thurman Thomas, demonstrated again that he is 
one of the league's quickest. Though weighing less than 200 pounds, Thomas 
obliged the Giants to put more men on him than they had put on any 49er running 
back earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
A year or two ago, the Buffalo offense was as conservative as the Giants' still 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"We've evolved into this gradually," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can play a more (wide open) game now because we have the people to do it -- 
especially a big tight end who can catch the ball, Keith McKeller, not to 
mention (wide receivers) Andre Reed, James Lofton and Don Beebe." 
</P>
<P>
Said Buffalo General Manager Bill Polian: "We decided in the off-season that we 
have the personnel to open up in the no-huddle offense." 
</P>
<P>
In other years, the Bills haven't really integrated pass plays into their 
run-oriented offense until the playoffs, when it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
The way they passed in the first half won a big game. On successive series, 
Kelly led the Bills 76 and 78 yards to short-yardage touchdowns -- throwing 
sometimes from shotgun formation on first down and moving the team as a rule 
with no-huddle plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We have what it takes to run the no-huddle now," Levy said. "We can leave our 
regular personnel on the field and throw the ball in power formations." 
</P>
<P>
Reed scored the first touchdown on a six-yard pass and Thomas the second when 
he cut inside Taylor on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had begun the game by plodding 71 yards on the ground to a 
fourth-and-a-foot touchdown by halfback Ottis Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, finally replacing Anderson, rookie Rodney Hampton gained most of 
his 105 yards on similar ground plays. His problem in the clutch was that he 
ran into Smith too often. 
</P>
<P>
Once more, the Giants seemed to be playing too conservatively to make a Super 
Bowl impression this winter. For example, on successive plays at midfield in 
the second quarter, they ran the ball on second and four and third and two, 
then punted. 
</P>
<P>
On their next series, after getting to the Buffalo 10-yard line on penalties, 
the Giants played for their field goal with a power run, a draw play, and a 
third-down pass that Simms threw away. 
</P>
<P>
That used to be Buffalo football, too. No more. The Bills have jumped into 
Super Bowl contention by abandoning their conservative approach. On numerous 
running downs now, they throw the ball, they attack their opponents, they come 
with four receivers on first down, they leave the huddling to such as the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Bills can stay in the championship race is now up to Reich, who was 
3-0 replacing Kelly last year. He seems to have the native ability. On defense, 
Smith has it.

MARINO STREAK ENDS AS BILLS GET 2 SACKS; DOLPHINS LOSE, 31-17

Thurman Thomas rushed for 148 yards in 27 carries and Larry Kinnebrew had 121 
in 21 tries and each scored a touchdown as the Buffalo Bills emphasized the run 
and the pass rush in a 31-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills have won three in a row and five of their last six and lead the 
American Conference East with a 6-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
The game was played before 80,208 fans -- the largest crowd ever at Rich 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo twice sacked Dan Marino, who had gone 19 games without being sacked, 
and gained 280 against the Dolphins. Thomas and Kinnebrew accounted for all but 
11 of those yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills ran on 51 of their 60 plays. 
</P>
<P>
With Frank Reich at quarterback, Buffalo has won all three games since Jim 
Kelly separated a shoulder in a 37-14 loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Wright snapped Marino's streak of 759 pass attempts without a sack in the 
second quarter, and Cornelius Bennett had another sack in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Marino also threw three interceptions, with Kirby Jackson returning his second 
of the game 40 yards for a touchdown with three minutes to play. Scott Secules 
then replaced Marino, who had 20 completions in 36 attempts for 255 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (4-4) managed only 65 yards rushing in losing for the first time 
in four games. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-point second quarter by the Bills blew the game open and gave them a 21-3 
lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnebrew opened the explosion two seconds into the quarter with a one-yard 
touchdown run. All 15 plays on the 76-yard drive were rushes. 
</P>
<P>
A Bennett interception at the Miami 42-yard line set up the score that put 
Buffalo ahead, 14-3. Bruce Smith, who stopped Dolphins running back Sammie 
Smith several times for losses in the first half, hurried Marino into throwing 
the interception. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas finished the four-play drive with a 30-yard scoring run. The play began 
as a sweep to the right and Thomas dodged four would-be tacklers before cutting 
to the left and into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The final touchdown of the quarter came on a 63-yard pass from Reich to rookie 
Don Beebe. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's two touchdowns came on two 44-yard passes, one from Marino to Mark 
Clayton and the other from Secules to Andre Brown.

<TEXT>
   Chief Frank Fools Crow, a widely respected
Sioux Indian spiritual leader who traveled with the Buffalo Bill
Cody Wild West Show as a young man, died Monday at the home of his
grandchildren.
   Fools Crow was born just south of the Porcupine district of the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. His exact age was not known, but he
was believed to be 99.
   In an interview earlier this year, Fools Crow said he quit
school in the third grade to work to help his family earn a living.
As he grew to manhood, he said, he traveled throughout the nation
with the Cody wild west show.
   The chief said he followed ``vision quests'' that directed him
into a life of healing and tribal leadership. He saw alcoholism and
jealousy as the greatest curses for Indian people.
   In an interview with The Rapid City Journal in February, Fools
Crow said he realized the world was changing, but modern problems
must be dealt with through cooperation and without losing sight of
the old ways.
   ``We need peace and understanding and unity of all young men,
young women and elders _ both Indian and non-Indian alike,'' Fools
Crow said. ``We must all stand together and work together for the
reason of peace and tranquility of life for all.''
   Fools Crow, a medicine man and spiritual grandfather, had lived
with grandchildren in a trailer home near Kyle after the death of
his second wife, Kate, in October 1988. His first wife, Fannie
Afraid of Hawk, died in 1954. Services are pending with the
Osheim-Catron Funeral Home in Rapid City.
   Fools Crow said respect, generosity, courage, knowledge and
wisdom were keys to the survival of the Lakota culture.
   ``These values start from the home. They are taught there and
expressed there and carried into the world,'' he said. ``You must
first better understand yourself before you can express yourself to
others. The Lakota values help you do this.''
   Thomas E. Mails, an artist and ethnologist who has produced four
major studies on North American Indians, wrote the holy man's
biography, titled ``Fools Crow.''

<TEXT>     Well, Kelly, who suffered a knee injury in that Dec. 15 game, returned for
the playoffs and has led the Bills to 95 points in two games.;    And the
Giants now seem to believe in Jeff Hostetler, who replaced Phil Simms after
the starting quarterback suffered a season-ending arch injury against Buffalo.
What's more, the Giants are back on a roll, having stuffed the Bears and
Niners offenses on the way to a Super Bowl berth.;    But on Dec. 15, the
Giants were the ones who were stuffed. Specifically running back Ottis
Anderson.;    He was stopped for a loss on third-and-one at the Bills' 3 in
the third quarter, and the Giants settled for a field goal to close to within
14-13. They never scored again.;    They certainly had a shot to put more
points on the board, though.;    Linebacker Lawrence Taylor dropped two
potential interceptions. On one of them, he could have scored a touchdown.;   
"I had the opportunities to make the difference," Taylor said after the game,
"I just couldn't make the plays. There's no way we should have lost this game,
especially after Kelly went down.";    Buffalo took control of the game early
and really never let go, although obviously there were some scary moments for
the Bills.;    Buffalo scored on its first two possessions. Andre Reed caught
a 6-yard TD pass to tie the game at 7 with 6 minutes, 30 seconds left in the
first quarter, and Thurman Thomas ran in from 2 yards with 14:09 left in the
first half to give the Bills a 14-7 lead.;    After two field goals by New
York's Matt Bahr, the Bills then pulled out to the 17-13 lead on Scott
Norwood's 29-yard field goal with 14:56 to go in the game.;  Buffalo

<LEADPARA>  Jim Kelly looked at the reporter incredulously when asked to identify the

the field?" Kelly asked. "Pardon me. You didn't see Thurman Thomas?"  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THOMAS HAS GAINED MORE YARDS THAN RESPECT
BILLS BACK RUSHES FOR GAME-HIGH 135 YARDS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Super Bowl XXV
Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It's easy to overlook Thomas despite numbers that make him the most
prolific running back/receiver in the NFL over the past two seasons.;   
Thomas, a third-year player from Oklahoma State, rushed for a game-high 135
yards in 15 carries, including a 31-yard score. He added five catches for 55
yards, epitomizing his versatility.;    His season with the Buffalo Bills had
been punctuated with a touch of spiteful rage at the many people within the
media and the NFL he perceives have never afforded him the proper accolades.; 
  That chance was within his grasp Sunday at Tampa Stadium, when Thomas moved
the Bills into scoring position for Scott Norwood's 47-yard field-goal
attempt.;    His run of 21 yards to the Bills' 40-yard line, followed shortly
by a 10-yard gain before the field-goal attempt, probably would have
positioned Thomas on a podium before a collection of microphones and cameras
capturing the emotions of the Super Bowl's most valuable player.;    But when
Norwood's kick sailed wide right in the final seconds, so did Thomas' chances
of national prominence. Thomas received only one MVP vote.;    "We didn't win
the ballgame, so you have to say that somebody on their team deserves to be
the most valuable player," Thomas said, congratulating Giants running back
Ottis Anderson. "If we would have won, maybe it would have been different.";  
 The Giants did everything possible to take Thomas out of the Bills' no-huddle
offense, assigning a "spy" to shadow Thomas constantly. Those responsibilities
belonged to Lawrence Taylor and Leonard Marshall. "I figured that by late in
the game they would forget about me," Thomas said.;    Hardly.;    Despite
Thomas' complaints, the Giants knew that one of their defensive priorities was
to stop Thomas.;    The Bills wavered on Thomas only slightly before selecting
him during the 1988 draft. Their concerns centered on a two-year-old knee
injury and subsequent surgery.;    The Bills picked Thomas, who rushed for 881
yards his rookie season, with the 39th selection in the draft. In subsequent
seasons, Thomas has rushed for 1,244 yards and 1,297 yards, including 11
rushing touchdowns this season.;    "I wanted to go out and show a lot of
media guys I was underrated and I didn't get the credit that I thought I
deserved," Thomas said. "Nobody around the league, or in other cities, thinks
I'm a good football player.;    "Hopefully, in a few months, I will be rated
higher.";    And, Thomas hopes, the opportunity of Super Bowl fame will come
once again.; THOMAS VS. ANDERSON; New York's Ottis Anderson won the
most-valuable-player award,; but Buffalo's Thurman Thomas won the battle of
running backs.; Here's how they compared Sunday:; Player        No.  Yds  Avg

<LEADPARA>  As quickly as you could say "no-huddle offense," it was no contest.;    The
Buffalo Bills showed no weakness and left no doubt in their 51-3 victory
Sunday over the Los Angeles Raiders that the AFC is a genuine possibility to
win its first Super Bowl since 1984, when the Raiders beat the Washington
Redskins.  </LEADPARA>

51-3  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  AFC Championship: Bills 51, Raiders 3
Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     By winning a trip to Tampa, the Bills cut the number of teams yet to go to
the championship game to nine. Buffalo lost the 1989 AFC championship game to
the Cincinnati Bengals 21-10. The Bills' only previous Super Bowl chance was
in 1967 when, as the two-time defending American Football League champions,
they lost 31-7 to the Kansas City Chiefs for a berth in the first Super Bowl.;
   The Raiders, who had the stingiest scoring defense in the league this
season, weren't up to stopping the Bills' relentless no-huddle offense that
scored an AFC championship game-record seven TDs, six in the first half.;   
It was Thurman Thomas up the middle, quarterback Jim Kelly to Thomas, Kelly to
wide receiver Andre Reed, Thomas up the middle and Kelly to Thomas again
before the flustered Raiders called a timeout and the Bills huddled for the
first time in the game.;    "I don't know how they did it," said Raiders
linebacker Jerry Robinson. "It was like clockwork -- everything they did --
just like clockwork.";    By then, in little more time than it takes to read
about it, the Bills were just 20 yards and five plays from a 7-0 lead and, in
effect, victory.;    Though the Raiders drove to a 41-yard field goal by Jeff
Jaeger on their first possession, the Bills scored again, in just four plays,
on their second possession to make it 14-3. After Darryl Talley intercepted a
pass by Jay Schroeder and returned it for a third touchdown, it was 21-3 with
3 minutes, 9 seconds to go in the first quarter.;    "The only thing that's a
problem with the no-huddle," Thomas said, "is that we score so quick there's a
lot of minutes left on the clock. We've decided that if we're going to score
quick, we might as well score touchdowns rather than field goals.";    The
no-huddle offense, considered a novelty when Bengals Coach Sam Wyche
introduced it in 1988, may be the NFL's fad of the future. The Bills, the
NFL's top scoring team, have scored 95 points in their two playoff games this
season, mostly without huddling.;    "I won't say it's not stoppable," said
Bills center Kent Hull, "but if we don't stop ourselves, this is as good an
offense as there is in the league.";    Yet even Hull says it's Kelly, not the
lack of huddling, that makes the offense go.;    "He sees those substitutes
come in and immediately goes to where the advantage is to our side," Hull
said.;    On the Bills' first possession, Los Angeles found itself in a
standard four-back defense and couldn't substitute a fifth back until the
timeout. By the Bills' third offensive series, the Raiders were up to six
defensive backs and Kelly was going more to Thomas, who rushed for 109
first-half yards and finished the day with 138 in 25 carries, leaving for good
in the third quarter.;    "Hey, if you're going to bring in all those DBs,
we're going to run the football," Kelly said.;    The Bills also unveiled a
new wrinkle they had been tempted to try last week against the Miami Dolphins,
whom they beat 44-34.;    Thomas, whose combined 1,829 yards rushing and
receiving during the regular season were the most of any NFL running back,
occasionally was moved outside as a fifth wide receiver, leaving Kelly alone
in shotgun formation. It helped Thomas make five receptions for 61 yards.;   
But there was little the Bills weren't successful with on offense until the
second half, when they went back to the old-fashioned huddle and conservative
play calling, and still scored 10 points.; LA Raiders  3 00 0--3; Buffalo

   Actor Bruce Boxleitner, who co-starred
in the television series ``Scarecrow and Mrs. King,'' will receive
the Buffalo Bill Award at the 1988 Nebraskaland Days, officials
said.
   Plans for the June 18-26 celebration were outlined Saturday
night at the annual Buffalo Bill Birthday Dance, one of
Nebraskaland Days' biggest fund-raisers.
   Nebraskaland Days President Kim Baxter said Boxleitner has
western connections through television movies and his interest in
quarter horses.
   ``To be honest, they're not making as many westerns as they used
to,'' Baxter said. ``It lessens the field when you limit it to
people in westerns. We've gone to choosing a person who represents
good family entertainment. But it's good when you can get someone
who has been in westerns.''
   Boxleitner appeared as James Arness' nephew in ``The Macahans,''
which inspired the ``How the West Was Won'' series. He was Kenny
Rogers' co-star in three ``Gambler'' television movies.
   Boxleitner lives in the San Fernando Valley, north of Los
Angeles.
   The annual celebration features rodeo performances, a parade and
many other events with a western theme. Gov. Kay Orr has designated
Nebraskaland Days as one of the key events in her ``Celebrate
Nebraska '88'' tourism promotion.

   Pop singer George Michael will undergo
surgery next week to remove a cyst from his vocal cords, forcing
him to cancel the rest of his scheduled performances in Europe, a
spokesman says.
   The operation will be performed Wednesday at an undisclosed
London hospital, publicist Phil Lobel said Friday.
   ``It will be four weeks before Michael can sing again,'' Lobel
said.
   Exploratory surgery this week found the cyst, he said.
   ``While I am very sad that I will have to disappoint my fans,''
Michael, 25, said in a statement, ``I am at least relieved that at
long last the real reason for my problems has been discovered.''
   Throat problems forced Michael to drop 20 shows in Australia at
the beginning of his tour in March, and he had feared he would lose
his voice.
   The remainder of Michael's European tour was cancelled, but the
North American leg of his world ``Faith Tour'' will proceed as
planned beginning Aug. 6 at the Capitol Center in Washington, D.C.

   President Reagan reminisced about his acting
days in a telegram to this central Missouri town, saying a scene in
the movie ``Kings Row'' was the finest he ever did.
   The 1941 movie was based on a book of the same name about
growing up in Fulton, which is holding its Kingdom Days celebration
this weekend.
   In the scene, Reagan, waking up after a leg has been amputated,
screams, ``Where's the rest of me?''
   ``We did this scene without rehearsal and you know or will soon
see the results,'' he said in the telegram Friday. ``I don't
believe I ever did quite as well again in a single shot.''
   The movie is to be screened during Kingdom Days, held to
celebrate the Civil War heritage of Callaway County. Robert
Cummings, who starred with Reagan in the movie, is scheduled to
appear and clothes worn in the movie will be displayed.

   When entertainer Roy Clark takes his
down-home brand of music to the Soviet Union this fall, he'll be
broadening his guitar-picking repertoire to include Russian
folksongs.
   ``It will be a country version of a balalaika orchestra,'' Clark
told a news conference Thursday.
   Clark plans 12 November performances as part of ``The Friendship
Tour,'' a venture partly underwritten by the U.S. Information
Agency and the Soviet concert agency Gosconcert.
   To raise additional funds, $2 postcards are being sold through a
nationwide radio network.
   Clark said he plans to present the giant collection of postcards
to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a goodwill gesture.
   ``There was no other way to say `I represent the American
people' unless they were involved,'' the musician said.

   ``Dirty Dancing'' star Patrick Swayze says his
next dance film will be his last, and will co-star his wife, Lisa
Niemi.
   ``I've had so much knee surgery; I think I have only one major
dance film left in me. Lisa and I will do it together,'' Swayze
said in an interview published in Vogue magazine's July issue.
   Swayze says he and his wife are more than just a marriage.
``When I move with Lisa, something electric happens,'' he said.
   They have been married 11 years, and met at his mother's dancing
school in Houston.
   ``Lisa and I are in this together. She's as much the reason for
my success as `Dirty Dancing.' This is a partnership. I just got
noticed first,'' he said.

   Bruce Boxleitner, who says he'd pay to
act in westerns, was named the annual Buffalo Bill Award winner for
his commitment to family entertainment.
   Friday's award was part of the Nebraskaland Days celebration
here. It is named for Buffalo Bill Cody, the world's first rodeo
producer who took his Wild West Show from North Platte on tours
around the world.
   Previous recipients include western novelist Louis L'Amour and
actors Gene Autrey and Henry Fonda.
   Working in westerns is challenging, said Boxleitner, 38, who
starred in the TV series ``Scarecrow and Mrs. King'' and in two
``Gambler'' movies with Kenny Rogers.
   ``It's not Shakespeare, but you have to learn the tools of the
trade,'' he said. ``I don't think a pay check enters into it. I'd
pay them.''

   Actor Walter Matthau's wife, Carol, says she is
writing a book about Hollywood called ``The Wrong Color Green.''
   ``All the cliches about this never-never land are true, yet
nobody has written successfully about it,'' she said in the
July-August issue of Lear's magazine. ``There is no `they' who
destroy you here. ... You are your own villain.''
   Mrs. Matthau, an actress who was twice married to playwright
William Saroyan before her 28-year union with the actor, says she
never told her husband when she finally decided to make her dream
of being a writer come true.
   ``I never said a word about it to him. (I) just started
writing,'' she said.

BILLS GET LAST CHANCE, GIVE THE RAMS FIRST DEFEAT, 23-20

With the game secured, intended messages sent, Greg Bell's clock rung, Frank 
Reich discovered, the unbeatens beaten and 1:33 remaining, a football game 
unraveled at the seams and unfolded into Monday night history -- a conclusion 
seen but not believed by the Rams, who may need weeks to recover. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffalo Bills defeated the Rams, 23-20, before 76,231 at Rich Stadium on an 
eight-yard scoring pass from Reich to receiver Andre Reed with 16 seconds 
remaining. But one play doesn't begin to tell the story of the Bills who, in a 
span of 1 minute 17 seconds, won a game, lost a game, and snatched a game back, 
using a near-impossible scenario that included a quarterback making his first 
National Football League start. 
</P>
<P>
It started innocently with Bill tailback Thurman Thomas, who was running out 
the clock on a 16-13 win, the Rams helpless after failing on fourth down at 
their own 22. Thomas headed into the line on first down, and was stripped of 
the ball by linebacker Mel Owens. Michael Stewart somehow recovered at the 22 
with 1:33 and one last breath of life to be breathed. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett heaved a pass over the middle on first down and Flipper 
Anderson somehow caught it and eluded defenders Kirby Jackson and Leonard Smith 
on the way to a 78-yard touchdown play with 1:22 left, deadening a sellout 
crowd and sending the Rams into gyrations of elation on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills were left with barely more than a minute and three timeouts with 64 
yards to cover behind Reich, Jim Kelly's replacement and a man who once went 
three years without throwing a pass in this league. 
</P>
<P>
It was thought Reich had worked his one miracle for the evening, leading the 
Bills on a fourth-quarter drive that ended with a one-yard scoring pass -- the 
presumed game-winner -- to Thomas with 2:23 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Reich is a boot salesman by trade, a quarterback by perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
When he took control behind center at his own 36 with 1:17 remaining, the 
Anderson catch firmly embedded, there seemed little chance. But the Rams were 
lying back, and Reich chopped them to pieces, the first deep cut coming on an 
18-yard pass to Thomas to the Ram 43. With 26 seconds left, Reich dumped a pass 
to Thomas for 15 yards to the Ram 22. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a swing pass to Ronnie Harmon, who moved passed safety Vince Newsome 
for 14 yards to the Ram eight. Twenty seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
What could Reich have up his sleeve? Who before Monday night could have cared? 
</P>
<P>
Reich's final strike to Reed was perfect on a post pattern. Reed lined up left 
and cut to the middle in front of Rams' cornerback LeRoy Irvin. Reed crossed 
the goal's plane with 16 seconds left, briefly stopping Ram hearts and making 
Reich a hero. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game in which the final two minute outshone the first 58. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Sutton, the ex-Ram cornerback who keeps following his former teammates 
around the league -- he's already faced the Rams this season as a Green Bay 
Packer -- set up the Rams' first score when he fumbled a wind-blown punt at his 
own 16 with 7:08 left in the quarter. On third and eight at the 14, Everett 
dumped a pass over the middle to Buford McGee to get the Rams to first and goal 
at the four. One play later, Everett found McGee again on a three-yard scoring 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Bills' defense, inspired by Bruce Smith and Cornelius Bennett, wouldn't 
let the Rams pull away. 
</P>
<P>
With with 6:13 left in the half, the Bills, with great pleasure, forced Bell to 
fumble for the first time in 112 carries this season. Jeff Wright recovered at 
the Ram 20, and although the drive stalled, Buffalo made it 7-3 on Scott 
Norwood's 38-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills shut down the Ram offense again on the ensuing possession, and got 
the ball back with 2:16 left at the Ram 49. 
</P>
<P>
Reich hit Reed on passes of nine and five yards to help get Buffalo close 
enough for Norwood. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Bills barely managed. Norwood's 47-yard field goal with 
56 seconds left grazed the crossbar on its way over, slicing the lead to 7-6 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who made no secret this week his disdain for Buffalo, was generally 
crushed at every turn. He gained 44 yards in 21 attempts but vowed to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the media tried to hype this game," Bell said. "I just tried to go out 
and play the best football that I was capable of playing. Tomorrow morning we 
will wake up and this game will be history. We are going home 5-1 instead of 
being 6-0." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had so many chances to prevent a miracle finish it bares inspection. 
On the first play of the second half, Thomas, who gained 105 yards in 24 
carries, fumbled at his 33. But the Rams were knocked out of field goal range 
when Smith sacked Everett for a five-yard loss to the 37. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the third quarter, with the Bills driving in Ram territory, Reich's 
pass went through cornerback Jerry Gray's hands and bounced into Reed's for a 
nine-yard gain. Had Gray held on, he might have scored. Instead, the Bills 
drove on and cut the lead to 10-9 on a 40-yard field goal by Norwood with 14:09 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams drove 60 yards on their next possession, but again had to settle for 
three -- on Lanford's 36-yarder -- instead of seven. 
</P>
<P>
The Bill defense, reborn after a slow start and local criticism, returned to 
form against the Rams, sacking Everett twice and causing several more poor 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Ellard, the NFL's leading receiver, made his first catch with 5:05 left 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"No question, they played their best game of the season," Bill Coach Marv Levy 
said of his defense. "They gave up that touchdown at the end on a great play, 
but they rose time and time again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ram linebacker Fred Strickland sprained his left ankle in the second half but 
X-rays were negative. . . . Jim Everett completed 15 of 36 passes for 219 yards 
with two touchdowns and one interception.

<LEADPARA>  BUFFALO, N.Y. It's a dateline. It's a football game. No, it's SuperBowl, and
that means I have to make a prediction.;    I hate making predictions. But I
like the Giants.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TAKE GIANTS OUTRIGHT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     I like the Giants to win Super Bowl XXV over the Buffalo Bills. Take the
points -- the Giants are getting seven -- but you won't need them, and neither
will the Giants. They'll win outright.;    The perspective on this matchup has
been severely skewed by Buffalo's 51-3 rout of the Los Angeles Raiders last
Sunday. Oh, it was impressive. So was the Bills' 44-34 beating of Miami a week
earlier. In two playoff games, the Bills have 95 points and nearly 1,000 yards
in offense.;    But today, the Bills aren't playing in Buffalo. They aren't
playing a warm-weather team in a cold, windy stadium. They are playing against
a defense the likes of which they have not seen, except for once. On Dec. 15,
the Bills played the Giants and beat them 17-13.;    "THAT was our worst
game," Giants safety Dave Duerson said last week. It was a statement, not an
excuse.;    "We stunk," said Coach Bill Parcells.;    Parcells said the Giants
stunk in two areas, specifically: short-yardage offense, and tackling. Indeed,
videotape shows 11 missed tackles by the Giants, resulting in 153 additional
yards for the Bills.;    It would be dangerous to put too much emphasis on
that Dec. 15 game. A lot has changed in six weeks. Buffalo quarterback Jim
Kelly, injured in that game, has returned. New York quarterback Phil Simms,
also injured that day, has not. But Jeff Hostetler has shown heart and
ability, and whatever the Giants lose by not having Simms -- if they lose
anything at all -- is offset by two more differences from the Dec. 15
meeting:;    First, this game will be played on grass, where the Bills are 2-5
the last two seasons.;    Second, this is the Super Bowl, where no Bills
player has ever been. Granted, the hype has been extraordinarily small. Cut in
half by the schedule and reduced further by events in the Persian Gulf, this
might be the least-hyped Super Bowl in the last 20 years.;    But when the
players step on the field today, they'll know where they are and they'll feel
the height of the stakes. The Giants have been here before -- 25 of them,
including Parcells.;    To many of the "experts" at the Super Bowl, Parcells
is the Giants' only chance. I don't know. Ever since that night at Candlestick
Park, when Parcells went for broke on fourth-and-goal from the 9, I've
wondered about the genius tag he wears.;    But Marv Levy is in a panic, they
say. He's tight. As evidence, they cite his decision to change hotels in
Tampa. Heck, that wasn't panic; that was a great move. You don't come to the
Super Bowl to stay at a Holiday Inn.;    Levy has done a tremendous job. The
Bickering Bills are now the Super Bowl Bills. They've got the no-huddle
offense. They've got the league's most-balanced offense. They've got Thurman
Thomas, a great running back. They've got Kelly, a fine quarterback.;    But,
in football, good hitting beats good pitching.;    The Giants' defense is No.
1 in fewest points allowed, No. 2 in yards allowed, No. 4 against the run and
No. 6 against the pass. Only one back has rushed for more than 100 yards
against the Giants, and it wasn't Thurman Thomas. (Phoenix rookie Johnny
Johnson ran for 108; Thomas had 60 yards -- in 21 carries -- in the Dec. 15
game.);    The Giants are tough, and they're smart. They've got a plan to
counteract the no-huddle offense. They've also got Lawrence Taylor. He can
still dominate a game, and you might see that today. He sees this as possibly
his last Super Bowl. He is a man possessed.;    And, of course, the Bills
can't score if they don't have the ball. Against the 49ers last Sunday, the
New York offense controlled the ball for almost 40 minutes. It was a 40-20
split the week before against Chicago, too.;    There's no reason to think the
Giants can't do that against the Bills. They already have, in fact; the Giants
controlled the ball for 37 minutes, 59 seconds of that Dec. 15 game. The Bills
rank 15th against the run.;    If this game comes down to a field goal, who do
you like: Matt Bahr or Scott Norwood? If it's a punting contest, you've got to
like the Giants' Sean Landeta.;    See, you can find a dozen reasons to like
the Giants. But you need only one, really, and it's the one I woke up with
Monday morning: These guys stopped Joe Montana twice. That's enough for me.  </TEXT>

   Hey, Buffalo Bill,
   Why Do You Kill?
</HL>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11
</SO>
<LP>
   Michael Pearce's Jan. 9 Leisure &amp; Arts article, "Where the
Buffaloes Roam," or, more appropriately, "Won't You Come
Home, Buffalo Bill?," is another approach to cleansing guilt
by rationalizing the final phase of hunting -- the killing
portion. And with every paper on justifying the need to kill,
there is a paper expressing the ridiculous thesis of such a
farce.
   I am not a "weed eater" or animal-rights fanatic. So what
grinds me about Mr. Pearce's article? It's the contention
that hunting farm-raised buffaloes by men dressed in
buckskins and using black-powder rifles somehow overcomes the
true nature of the hunt. Hunting and killing animals is an
issue of control, of playing God over a living thing, and
nothing more. Unless, of course, you are stranded in the
middle of the wilderness and it is a means of survival.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Roy English of the story went to get meat. Sure, right.
And low in cholesterol -- hey, that's important. Don't get me
wrong. When I hunted as a boy, I was taught not to shoot
anything I didn't plan to clean and cook. But I didn't hunt
with the idea that I was reliving history or putting food on
the table. It was for sport, and that is what hunting
buffaloes is. If hunting a herd of ranch-raised animals can
be considered much of a hunt. At least I assume that the ones
on the Smoky River Buffalo Ranch are wilder than the ones
that stroll out of Yellowstone National Park.
   The article should have been written for one of the
hunting magazines; then Mr. Pearce could have gotten the
romance for his article that it justly deserved. The article
may have been appreciated in this paper had it ended one
sentence before Darrell Wuertz's "humane insurance shot." But
Mr. Pearce has a right to submit his work to anyone. And this
paper has the right to print what it wants. Wilbur Williams
is within his rights to have a hunting ranch. He can stock it
with buffaloes or Holstein cows. Say, there's an idea.
   How many of you hunters out there ever got to sit around
the campfire and talk about the Holstein cow you brought
down? As for Mr. English, he could take a pail and stool with
him, milk the cow, then shoot it.

<HEAD>Museum Visitor Points Out Error In Remington Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bronze cowboy sculpture ``The Rattlesnake''
by famed Western artist Frederic Remington stopped museum visitor
Cy Baumgartner in his tracks _ the cowboy's tiny spurs were on
upside down.
   ``There's no way a cowboy would wear his spurs pointing up like
that,'' said Baumgartner, a former rodeo cowboy who now drives a
beer truck and raises quarter horses. ``It would be totally out of
character.''
   Baumgartner, who was touring the Remington exhibit Sunday at the
St. Louis Art Museum, apparently was the first to notice the error.
   ``I saw it immediately,'' he said. ``I just think it's funny
that nobody noticed it before now.''
   After Baumgartner pointed out the problem, museum workers
checked other bronzes on display.
   They found that all the spurs on the four horsemen in a casting
of ``Coming Through The Rye'' were also upside down.
   Peter H. Hassrick, one of the curators of the exhibit, said he
has occasionally noticed similar problems with Remington works in
private collections. He said he hadn't noticed the problem in the
St. Louis exhibit.
   But that doesn't necessarily mean that Remington, the famed
sculptor and painter of Western themes who lived from 1861 to 1909,
made the error.
   The spurs on the bronzes and other small pieces were cast
separately from the main work and, as a result, it was sometimes
left to a foundry worker with little knowledge of a cowboy's gear
to attach the spurs to the boots.
   On other occasions, Hassrick said, the spurs may have been
damaged and replacement spurs attached turned the wrong way.
   ``It's just a silly little thing, but I'm sure Remington wold
have liked to have seen them the right way,'' Hassrick said.
   ``If they were on one of our bronzes, we'd turn them around,''
said Hassrick, director of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in
Cody, Wyo., and an authority on Remington.
   Neither of the works in question, however, is owned by the
museum. ``The Rattlesnake'' casting is from a private collection,
and the casting of ``Coming Through the Rye'' is on loan from
Princeton University.
   The exhibit is open in St. Louis through May 22.

NEW ORLEANS: JOURNEYMAN QUARTERBACK LEADS SAINTS TO 22-19 VICTORY.

<P>
His journey has been a long and circuitous one through seven cities and three 
football leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But 29-year-old John Fourcade -- formerly of the Memphis Showboats, Toronto 
Argonauts and Denver Dynamite -- finally made it to the big time Sunday and 
responded with a big-time performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around in every league known to man except the European leagues," 
said Fourcade, who led New Orleans to a 22-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills. 
"I was just happy to be out there playing today." 
</P>
<P>
Fourcade, whose only other starts came as the Saints' replacement quarterback 
during the 1987 strike, threw two touchdown passes, and Dalton Hilliard rushed 
for 97 yards and caught a 54-yard touchdown pass. Fourcade started in place of 
Bobby Hebert, whom Fourcade replaced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, Philadelphia's 20-10 win over Dallas ended the Saints' 
slim playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a good football team," New Orleans linebacker Pat Swilling said. "We 
just won't be going to the playoffs to show it." 
</P>
<P>
The loss was Buffalo's second in a row and third in four games. The Bills (8-6) 
are repeating their swoon of last season, when they lost three of their final 
four regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a horror show," said Bills nose tackle Fred Smerlas. "We've got to 
go out and redeem ourselves if we're going to make the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints (7-7), who gained 436 total yards, took advantage of Buffalo 
turnovers on each of their first two possessions to build a 13-0 lead in the 
first quarter, and take a 16-12 lead after a snowy first half. 
</P>
<P>
The snow disappeared in the second half, but the Saints' defense continued to 
handle the Bills, getting a timely interception midway in the fourth quarter 
that New Orleans eventually turned into the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Toi Cook, beat in the second quarter for a 42-yard touchdown pass caught by 
James Lofton, picked off a tipped ball near the Saints' end zone as Buffalo was 
driving for a go-ahead score. 
</P>
<P>
"The way (Bills' kicker Scott) Norwood was kicking, that would've been a chip 
shot for him," Cook said. "Somebody (Thurman Thomas) tipped the ball and it 
just ended up in my hands." 
</P>
<P>
With Fourcade and Hilliard leading the way, the Saints drove 81 yards to the 
Buffalo four, setting up a 22-yard field goal by Morten Andersen. Brett Maxie 
clinched the victory with New Orleans' third interception of Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of them after what has happened the last couple of weeks," said 
New Orleans Coach Jim Mora, whose team lost their previous two games by a total 
of 10 points. "You have to play pretty good to beat these guys."

<LEADPARA>  The Buffalo Bills reached the silver anniversary Super Bowl with a 15-3

without a huddle.;    In this case, what the Bills don't have is almost as

<HEADLINE>  THE BILLS' NO-HUDDLE CAN MUDDLE A DEFENSE
WASTING NO TIME, BUFFALO'S OFFENSE HAS BEEN
WORKING LIKE CLOCKWORK  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Super Bowl XXV: A Viewer's Guide
Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Buffalo had quarterback Jim Kelly for four previous seasons, ever since the
folding of the USFL in which he played, but the offense he directed was so
lifeless that not only Kelly but Bills owner Ralph Wilson publicly
complained.;    Offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda switched to the
no-huddle, which put the play-calling responsibility on Kelly as well as
prevented substitutions and adjustments by the defense. He was persuaded to
change for a reason that long has intrigued many football fans: With the
ability of no-huddle offenses to rapidly move the ball in the final minutes of
each half, why not use such an offense the entire game?;    "Last year there
were three times when we had to score the last two times we had the ball to
win -- the Rams, Miami and Houston," Marchibroda told the Buffalo News this
week. "So I said to myself, 'If it's so successful at the end of the half and
the end of ballgames, why would it not be successful during the regular course
of the game?' So we opened up with it against Indianapolis, and it has been
going ever since.";    Using the new offense against the Colts in the season
opener, Kelly began the game with a team-record 14 consecutive completions in
a 26-10 victory.;    A week later, on an 88-degree day in Miami, the Bills
were clobbered 30-7. Two fumbles, an interception and three sacks proved the
no-huddle wasn't invincible. The Bills later called the game their "wake-up
call.";    But it was two weeks later, after a 30-7 Monday night victory over
the New York Jets in which all-purpose back Thurman Thomas rushed for 214
yards, that the rest of the NFL woke up to what the Bills were up to.;    More
than the no-huddle offense was working for the Bills.;    Within 1 minute, 17
seconds of a Sept. 30 game against the Denver Broncos, the Bills threw up 20
fourth-quarter points, erased a 21-9 Broncos lead and won 29-28. The next
week, in Game 5, with the Los Angeles Raiders leading 24-14 in the final
period, Buffalo scored 24 points in 6:03 to win 38-24.;    The victory over
the Raiders began with a 42-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to wide receiver
James Lofton. Then a blocked punt by Steve Tasker was picked up by James
Williams and returned for a touchdown. Linebacker Cornelius Bennett sacked the
Raiders' Jay Schroeder on the next possession, causing a fumble that Bennett
recovered. The Bills got a field goal from that turnover. Three plays later,
cornerback Nate Odomes stripped the ball from receiver Willie Gault and ran 49
yards for another TD.;    It took a scoring pass from Kelly to fullback Jamie
Mueller with 19 seconds to go to beat the Jets 30-27 the next week before the
scary games were over for a while.;    The Bills knocked off the New England
Patriots 27-10 in Game 7, swamped the Cleveland Browns 42-0 in Game 8, pounded
the Phoenix Cardinals 45-10 in rain, hail and snow to start the second half of
the season, and then shut out the Patriots 14-0.;    In Houston, the string
snapped. The Oilers, behind the passing of Warren Moon, won 27-24.;    The
next week against the playoff-bound Philadelphia Eagles, however, Kelly fired
three touchdown passes in a 24-0 first quarter and the Bills held on for a
30-23 victory.;    An easy 31-7 victory over the Colts brought the Bills to a
Super Bowl preview, a 17-13 defeat of the New York Giants in which Kelly and
Giants quarterback Phil Simms sustained injuries.;    Playing without Kelly,
who had suffered torn cartilage and damaged ligaments in his knee, the Bills
avenged their early season defeat by downing the Dolphins 24-14 to clinch the
AFC East title. Fill-in quarterback Frank Reich was 15 of 21 for 234 yards and
TDs to Lofton and Andre Reed.;    With the home-field advantage assured
throughout the AFC playoffs, the Bills were downed 29-14 by the Washington
Redskins in the regular-season finale.;    After a week off while the
wild-card teams and the weakest division winner fought it out, Kelly returned
to the lineup to lead the Bills to a 44-34 victory over the Dolphins in a
snowstorm. That set up Sunday's 51-3 blowout of the Raiders and a berth in the
Super Bowl.;    "There used to be a joke around here when we were not
winning," linebacker Darryl Talley said after the AFC championship game. "It
went: 'Knock, knock.' 'Who's there?' 'Owen.' 'Owen who?' 'Oh and 10.' ";   
It's not a joke the Bills have heard this season.;  Bills' log (15-3); Sept. 9

<DESCRIPT>  RESTAURANT; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  One of the best birthday presents I've received lately is a book on bad taste.
I refused to take the gift personally, but I felt it was a reflection of my
fascination with American pop culture. Pop culture is really serious business,
something akin to a fun house mirror, as it usually tells us more about
ourselves and how we live than we commonly think about and perhaps more than
we would like to know.;    If I were to mention almost any of the items or
categories in the Encyclopedia of Bad Taste, I'd be inundated with letters
castigating my morals, intelligence and parentage.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BUFFALO BILL STILL SERVES GOOD PUB FOOD
HAYWARD EATERY FEATURES WELL-MADE BEER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Dining Out
The Weekly's reviewers evaluate restaurants as typical consumers. They visit
area restaurants as unannounced, paying customers.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Needless to say, I was a little surprised to find beer included, though the
authors provide a fair rationale for their choice. On the other hand, however,
a growing little industry is the brew pub and its accompanying cuisine.;   
Buffalo Bill's brew pub in Hayward, owned and operated by an award-winning
former photo-journalist Bill Owens, was at the vanguard of the brew pub
movement and while some places have come and gone, Buffalo's, which opened in
1982, has been around for a while.;    This is not high cuisine. Instead, what
you get is an Americanized version of pub food: fairly simple food, usually a
little spicy, chosen and served to accompany and complement the custom-brewed
beer.;    What is nice, even good, about brew pubs, and there is a fair-sized
number of such places ringing the bay, is that each is different in the beer
they brew and serve, in their food and in their atmosphere. This is true
individuality in a culture marked by mass marketing and mass consumption.;   
The food served at Buffalo Bill's is, after all, pretty good. It is usually
quickly prepared and served and is priced at the lower end of the restaurant
dollar spectrum.;    At the high end of the menu are Buffalo Bill's personal
pizzas for $5.;    Given what I have paid for a personal pizza, this is a good
buy.;    The offerings actually vary, so it's worth asking what's on the
menu.;    Not long ago I had an American southwestern style pizza, flavored
with a smoky, salsa-like sauce in lieu of the traditional tomato paste. There
were chilies, red peppers, onions, dried tomatoes and a chorizo-style sausage.
Not only was it very good, but given what a Berkeley or San Francisco
gourmet-ghetto personal pizza goes for, it was a steal.;    More recently,
Buffalo's has been offering a more traditional personal pizza, but the quality
of ingredients, peppers, salami, onions, is more than adequate and the sauce
at least on the good side of average.;    The thin pizza crust is handmade and
as good as you'd find.;    One warning however: because this is a small
restaurant, they do sell out. On a recent Monday lunch, the pizzas weren't
available because they had used all the available dough on the weekend and the
new batch hadn't finished rising.;    In the mid-range of prices, at $3, is a
small selection of sandwiches, turkey, ham, pastrami and the like, as well as
two good sausages, a hot link and a polish sausage.;    Both the hot link and
polish are done very well. Served on a crisp french roll, the sausages are
meaty, lean, flavorful and tender.;    To make a good thing even better, the
links are served with melted jack or Swiss cheese and dressed with a dark,
spicy tomato sauce which complements the taste of the meat.;    Accompanying
the roll will be a generous handful of tortilla chips, pickle chips and a hot
pepper or two. For $3, not bad.;    A couple other pub classics, buffalo wings
and a ploughman's lunch are also available for $3. Both are a good, cheap
lunch.;    Bill's soups ($3.50 a bowl, $2 a cup), are also better than
expected. Again, the offering will change daily, but I've sampled three:
chili, corn chowder and black bean soup, and all were done very competently.
The soups, and all the food, are made in a tiny kitchen so it is sometimes
amazing how good the items are. The black bean soup was superb and it is worth
a call to find out when it's being offered.;    I can do without the swirl of
sour cream that cooks seem to think is necessary, but the soup was rich and
filled with a complex range of spices and taste. It is good.;    Bill's chili
is also done very well and when I heard the person behind the bar boast about
her "killer chili," I had to try it.;    While a bowl of chili and a glass of
beer may be really plebeian, when you taste both (or either) at Buffalo's,
then you may want to consider your preconceptions.;    The chili, like the
black bean soup, was hearty and rich, filled with tender beans, a deep broth
and tender pieces of meat. Even on a sunny winter's day, you can't go wrong.; 
  My last lunch at Buffalo's coincided with an offering of Bill's Double Cream
Ale ($1.75 for a small glass, $3.25 for a pint), one of the smoothest,
creamiest ales I've tasted.;    There is a hint of cream soda in the glass,
but this is true, pure beer, born of a skilled brewer's hand. If you associate
beer with the canned or bottled stuff brewed in huge tanks and consumed in
mass quantities in front of a televised football game, then prepare to have
your reality altered.;    In fact, almost all of Bill Owen's beers are very
good and brewed for sipping and tasting, not for some macho entertainment. In
the fall, a trip to Hayward to taste his Pumpkin Ale is worth making.;    The
decor/atmosphere is on the downside. The place is dark with concrete walls
lightened by a collection of flags, a history of brewing and beer display, a
battered football game, cases of beer, a dart board and, of course, a
wall-mounted buffalo head. There is a long wooden bar and a collection
miscellaneous library tables and assorted chairs. It is, for good or bad, the
type of place where you don't need to take off your baseball hat when you
dine.;    Buffalo Bill's; (star)(star) 1/2; Where: 1082 B Street, Hayward;

<DESCRIPT>  CELEBRITY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  CHANCES seem solid that Tommy Lee Jones, Anjelica Huston and other principal
members of the 1989 "Lonesome Dove" cast will take part in its planned
sequel.;    According to exec producer Suzanne de Passe, all "surviving cast
members" are ready to saddle up for another chapter in the western saga,
"subject to reading the script, of course."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  'LONESOME DOVE' SEQUEL A LIKELIHOOD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     That script is now being drafted by John Wilder, with "Lonesome Dove"
novelist Larry McMurtry serving as consultant. If all goes as planned,
"Lonesome Dove II" should be galloping onto the video range in the fall of
'92.;    MEANWHILE: De Passe hopes to follow the "Lonesome" sequel with a
four-hour miniseries adaptation of McMurtry's "Buffalo Girls" for CBS. "We've
made the deal . . . Hopefully we could make it for spring of '93." De Passe
has no casting in mind for the featured role of Calamity Jane, but says the
part is an actress' dream. She explains that McMurtry's "Buffalo Girls" paints
a very different portrait of the renowned gun-totin' cowgirl who buddied with
such famed real-life characters of the Old West as Wild Bill Hickock and
Buffalo Bill Cody. Says the producer, "She's really a rugged character in this
piece -- with her male side extremely in the forefront . . . she lived hard,
rode hard and abused herself. She had a heart of gold, but was very
self-destructive and could never quite pull it all together. It's a very
poignant story."; From Liz Smith in New York;    MORE VOTES: Last week, it was
said that a Massachusetts voters' poll indicates Sen. Edward Kennedy should
step aside in the light of recent events in Palm Beach.;    Interestingly
enough, columnist Jimmy Breslin was the first to point the way for the
senator, suggesting it was time for him to try Alcoholics Anonymous. Now comes
the controversial and powerful Bob Scheer in the August issue of Playboy, and
he urges Kennedy to do the same thing.;    Scheer makes his plea in an
evocation of Kennedy's longtime effectiveness as a U.S. senator and says Ted's
efforts as a public servant have far outstripped both his brothers', John and
Robert. Scheer notes that Kennedy is the best advocate for America's
underprivileged, and he too urges the senator to embrace "the 12 steps.";   
NOVEL RESPONSE: Julia Phillips called this week. Although banned from all of
L.A.'s smart movie-denizen cafes since she published her memoir, "You'll Never
Eat Lunch in This Town Again," she sounded well-fed and carefree.;   
Recently, this column reported that Phillips is working on her second book,
and it was implied that such a work might be based on portions cut by her
publisher's attorneys from Phillips' infamous real-life tale of her
drugged-out life and times. She says she may have "facetiously" said so, but
it is incorrect.;    "I have been struggling to write a complete book of
fiction for the past 10 years. Now I am actually going to do it, but not from
'discards' out of 'Lunch.' This novel will have as a character a dog who talks
and has a drug problem."  </TEXT>

<P>
Whenever Larry McMurtry sits down at the campfire of modern fiction, a wild 
cast of characters soon amble in from the shadows, and their compelling yarns 
quickly edge any weighty issues into the background. So it is in this tale of 
Martha Jane Canary, better known as Calamity Jane, as she and her companeros 
ramble across their old stompin' grounds, from the great plains of the Dakotas 
to the mountains of Montana and Wyoming, aimlessly seeking some vague goal that 
they all sense can no longer be found. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian wars are over, the buffalo gone, and the romance of the West withers 
even as the legends it spawned blossom. The challenges of the old West took a 
physical toll, but this transitional era leaves folks without purpose. While 
the only violence in this novel happens "off stage," there is plenty of pain to 
go around. Now it is the characters' souls that get a sound whomping. 
</P>
<P>
In her younger days, Jane loved to "drink and sing and hoorah" with the 
cowboys. As "Buffalo Girls" unfolds, though, her carousing has become a form of 
self-administered anesthesia, rather than a celebration of the West's huge 
freedom. None of this is lost on the friends who wander in and out of Jane's 
life, including mountain men Bartle Bones and Jim Ragg, an old Ogalala Sioux 
named No Ears and Jane's best friend Dora DuFran, who runs a Miles City saloon 
and whorehouse named Hotel Hope. 
</P>
<P>
The central irony of the story is that the only hope of salvation for these 
characters arrives in an offer from their old friend Buffalo Bill, who 
convinces them that they might recapture their past glories -- real or imagined 
-- by joining his Wild West Show for a performance before Queen Victoria in 
London. In their hearts, Jane and her friends see the paradox. As Bartle says: 
"If Billy Cody can make a poster of it, then there ain't no Wild West." But 
Jane understands how desperately people can cling to foolish hopes. Eventually, 
she and her friends join Cody, Annie Oakley, Sitting Bull and other characters 
from the history books and McMurtry's imagination to condense the shoot-'em-up 
history and myth of the West into a sort of live-action miniseries, there in 
the heart of the civilization their forebears abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
It is fruitless to try and figure out how closely McMurtry sticks to facts 
here, because so many of the figures in this novel, as in "Anything for Billy" 
before it, were mired in legend long before McMurtry plucked them from their 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
But the mythologizing of history is only part of what "Buffalo Girls" is about. 
Both the characters and their country are struggling with middle age and the 
possibility that "the fun is over," and this discussion of loss and maturity 
also drives the book. 
</P>
<P>
Because "the fun" often was so excessive, for instance, the characters are left 
to face regrets. The West, Bartle concedes wistfully, has been "used up." 
</P>
<P>
" 'I blame it on the Indians,' he says. 'They gave up too soon.' " But he knows 
where the real blame lies: "What a monstrous mistake it had been to popularize 
buffalo hunting. Millions of them had roamed the plains -- it still seemed 
hardly credible to men who had seen the great herds in their glory that so many 
animals could be killed in only three years. But it had occurred: It weakened 
the Indians, armies had marched, brave men had died, and now they were to down 
to expositions." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the more poignant scenes in a book full of them, Jim Ragg, who has 
been inconsolable since he faced the realization that the beaver had gone the 
way of the buffalo, finds an exhibit of live American beaver at the London zoo. 
</P>
<P>
For days, he sits and watches the animals he spent his life trapping, his faith 
in the world renewed. 
</P>
<P>
In another wonderful scene, No Ears, perhaps the most engaging character in the 
book, seems to foresee the continued destruction of the world's resources. As 
he sits on the boat that is taking the show to England, enthralled by the 
ocean, the vast "herds" of fish flashing beneath the waves remind him of the 
buffalo charging in seemingly endless profusion over the plains. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry tells his story in part through letters supposedly written by Jane to 
her daughter Janey, whom she has sent away to live with a well-to-do city 
couple. Recently, several male writers -- Jay McInerney, Reynolds Price and Jim 
Harrison among them -- have attempted to write from a woman's viewpoint, with 
mixed results. Some feminist critics even have chastised them for their 
arrogance. The real Jane did write letters to a supposed daughter, but with 
McMurtry's grip on Calamity's pen, these letters take some unusual twists, and 
the gender issue in "Buffalo Girls" is complicated by the fact that Jane is an 
unusually well-balanced mix of masculine and feminine traits. Even the delicate 
issue of Jane's suspect womanhood, however, becomes almost insignificant in the 
sprawling context of the West -- where, as McMurtry portrays things, tolerance 
is as important a survival technique as knowing how to crawl into the 
still-warm belly of a slaughtered buffalo in a blizzard. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, McMurtry keeps the epistolary tactic reined in. Jane's voice is merely 
an intriguing subtext to his own much richer narrative voice. It is McMurtry's 
description and dialogue and character, after all, that make readers plunge 
into the author's books the way some people fall into soap operas, wanting to 
spend as much time with his imagined people as possible, even though the 
characters are often thoroughly disagreeable. 
</P>
<P>
In this sense, "Buffalo Girls" is "Lonesome Dove" writ small. The book rolls 
along on anexistential current of melancholy, in contrast to which the moments 
of joy and hilarity are especially vivid. The good old days are gone, and most 
of these people will have no part in what follows. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the West from England, No Ears finds his people demoralized, 
lacking even the survival instinct to listen to the old man's spiritual wisdom. 
Jane and her companeros have grown lazy and confused, unwilling to embrace the 
myths they are becoming, yet living in their own self-embellished pasts. As 
Jane writes: "Now all I do is piddle around in my memories. You've seen 
children make mud pies? That's what I do with my memories, I pat them into the 
shape I want them to take." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is something about these people and their passion for life that 
makes you want to be with them. You want to sit in the dirt and share that old 
prairie dog that Jim Ragg has just cooked over a barely flickering fire, even 
though he suspects it may be diseased. Why? Because set against the 
overwhelming vastness of the West, and of life, tolerable companionship looks 
awfully good. Despite the mundane sadness and glorious tragedy that stalks 
them, McMurtry's characters seem to understand that life is, as one cowboy put 
it, "a sturdy business." 
</P>
<P>
How the West was won (or lost) doesn't make all that much difference here. 
History happened, and that's that. What matters is that the world was kept from 
flying apart by something as simple as friendship.
