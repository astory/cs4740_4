FT  18 JUN 94 / The Nature of Things: Scientists on the ball - A form of
carbon shaped just like a football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What does chemistry have in common with the World Cup? Answer: great
excitement about balls.
The most significant molecule discovered in the past 10 years is C, the
football-shaped form of carbon known officially as buckminsterfullerene -
fullerene or buckyball for short. An astonishing range of applications has
been proposed for fullerene and related compounds: from batteries to Aids
treatment; better photocopiers to super-slippery lubricants; rocket fuel to
ultra-strong fibres.
But chemists are not just excited about the potential uses of fullerene.
They marvel at its spherical shape - more symmetrical than any molecule
previously known to science. And they are delighted that pure carbon - long
known to exist in two forms, graphite and diamond - can take a third form so
different to both of the others.
In diamond, the hardest natural material, each atom is linked to three
others in a three-dimensional tetrahedral arrangement. In graphite, one of
the softest, the atoms lie in two-dimensional hexagonal sheets. Fullerene is
a 'truncated icosahedron', one of the 13 Archimedean solids known since
classical times. Its 60 carbon atoms are arranged in a regular cage whose
sides consist of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons - just like a soccer ball
(which usually has the hexagons coloured black and the pentagons white).
But the scientists who discovered C in 1985, Harry Kroto of the University
of Sussex in England and Richard Smalley of Rice University in Texas, were
not soccer fans. Instead they named the molecule after the late Buckminster
Fuller, the American engineer who designed geodesic domes with a similar
shape.
The discovery illustrates the spin-offs that can come from 'blue skies'
research pursued out of intellectual curiosity. The driving force behind it
was Kroto's desire to understand the nature and structure of matter in
interstellar space.
Kroto believed, on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, that long chains and
other clusters of carbon atoms existed between the stars. To investigate
further, he convinced Smalley to join a co-operative project, using special
equipment designed by the latter to generate atomic clusters from a
supersonic jet of gas in a laser beam. They found that molecules with 60
carbon atoms were particularly stable - and proposed the correct fullerene
structure - but could only produce them in microscopic quantities.
As it turns out, fullerene is widespread in nature. Spectroscopic studies
show that Kroto's 'celestial spheres' are indeed almost certainly present in
interstellar space. On earth, tiny traces of C have been detected in
65m-year-old rock dating from the end of the Cretaceous era; they may have
formed in the cataclysmic collision with a comet that exterminated the
dinosaurs.
The breakthrough towards practical applications came in 1990 when Wolfgang
Kratschmer of the Max Plank Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg and
Don Huffman of the University of Arizona in Tucson discovered a simple way
of making relatively large amounts of C. They vaporised graphite electrodes
in a low-pressure helium atmosphere, producing a sooty black mist from which
pure fullerene could be extracted as a reddish solution and then
crystallised as a slippery yellow solid.
Within months of the process being published, many scientific groups were
making their own fullerene and today the material is available commercially.
For example, Dynamic Enterprises, a UK supplier, sells more than 99.5 per
cent pure C at Pounds 100 a gram - and an educational Buckybox kit for
schools to make their own fullerene costs Pounds 95.
As well as C, the Kratschmer-Huffman process produces smaller quantities of
other previously unknown fullerene-like molecules. Most common is an
elongated form, C, which looks like a rugby ball.
More exotic variants include buckytubes - fullerene stretched out
indefinitely in one direction - and bucky-onions - concentric shells of
successively larger fullerenes. Researchers at NEC, the Japanese electronics
group, have recently made buckytubes only a few millionths of a millimetre
thick but more than a thousandth of a millimetre long, and filled them with
metal atoms. They are the finest wires ever made and are potentially far
stronger than the conventional carbon fibres used in industry.
At the same time, scientists are making chemical derivatives of C by
attaching other elements to its carbon atoms. One example is a fullerene
with two water-soluble molecular groups attached to its surface. This turns
out in test-tube experiments to block an essential enzyme in HIV, the Aids
virus, and is a long-shot candidate for development into an Aids drug.
Another avenue of research is to make fullerenes in which the cage itself is
made of elements other than carbon. Japanese researchers are investigating
N, a buckyball made entirely of nitrogen, which would release huge amounts
of energy as it reverted to nitrogen gas. It could be a rocket fuel or
explosive.
But the first application of fullerenes may well be in photocopiers. Xerox
recently received US patents for a process to improve the resolution of
photocopies, taking advantage of the fact that carbon buckyballs are 1,000
times smaller than the particles in conventional toner. The company is also
experimenting with a range of coloured fullerenes for colour reproduction.
From the English point of view, fullerene fever is sadly like the World Cup.
We invented the game and now all the action is taking place elsewhere.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport (World Cup '94): A new generation wooed by skill -
Robbie Walther, 15, plays soccer for Dalton School in New York City. He says
that doesn't make him a wimp / Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why do I, a good, young, upstanding American, play soccer and not American
football, basketball or baseball? The question had never crossed my mind
before it was announced that the soccer World Cup would be played on
American soil.
As soon as I heard the news I was ecstatic, but confused. How could soccer's
most prestigious tournament be played where football, baseball and
basketball reigned supreme; where soccer had not even been televised on the
four major networks; and where anyone who wants to watch a soccer game
either has to listen to a commentary on a cable station - probably in a
different language - or go and watch a college match, at times possibly the
most embarrassing athletic vision the US has to offer?
My feeling is that it was the suburbs and the immigrant communities around
the country that helped create the impression of some interest in soccer.
But one thing was certain, I thought: it was not people like me who caused
Fifa, the sport's governing body, to choose America as home for the 1994
World Cup.
I have been playing soccer since I was six years old and, since everything
back then had to revolve around me, I naturally assumed that just about
everybody played soccer. Now that I am in high school, it is pretty obvious
that I am in quite a small minority.
This must have something to do with the availability of soccer equipment in
New York City. For a pick-up game of American football in the park, all you
need is six kids, a football and something to mark the end zone. Soccer
needs a ball, at least 10 kids - and two goals.
Now, some of the suburbs and areas with heavy immigrant populations do have
pitches and goal-posts marked out, but not the New York City parks I know.
So soccer is almost destined to falter in the cities, though there are a few
of us who keep the game alive in urban areas.
In New York, the football and soccer seasons overlap, which forces choice on
anybody who wants to play both. I tried football, but once I had experienced
the joys of a sport in which it takes 30 minutes to put on pads to play for
another 30 minutes without ever actually touching the ball with hand or feet
(I was big enough to play in the line), I lost my taste for it. When I said
as much to the football coach, he reprimanded me with words that not only
told me he liked anchovy pizza but also that he thought I was a wimp. I was
nudged towards soccer.
If the football coach started me playing, I have stayed with soccer because
it is different and I love it. It does not involve my hands or brawn but it
does involve my feet and brain (speed helps, too). There is no other sport
in the world that allows the feet (and sometimes the head) to do the
scoring. So, a country where men like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Joe
Montana and Lawrence Taylor are labelled as superior athletes has yet to
produce a soccer superstar like Pele, just about the only soccer player
anybody has ever heard of.
Other kids my age have not been so lucky to have soccer's history and
traditions explained to them, and it is hard for them to learn about the
game.
Most start not by playing it but through television. And here's something
interesting: we can now see TV commercials that use soccer to sell a product
 -for example, Snickers candy, in which a man is shown juggling a soccer
ball.
The target of this commercial is children, which tells me that the
advertising people have worked out that soccer just might be bigger among
kids than they had thought. Now we have reports that an eight-team American
soccer league might be formed.
On reflection, maybe America got the World Cup not just because its
government put in the highest bid but because of people like me, who live in
big cities, as well as the suburbanites and the immigrants.
I guess Fifa saw that America could become a great soccer-playing nation,
and how much my generation needed a new pastime. Perhaps we are really on
our way.

Fotoball USA owners were rooting for the Oakland Athletics to win the 1990 
World Series, but it really did not matter to them that the Cincinnati Reds 
emerged victorious. Whichever team won, the San Diego company expected to come 
out smelling like a rose long after the last crack of the bat. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old company is licensed by Major League Baseball to manufacture 
special edition Fotoballs and roster balls for the World Series. The Fotoballs 
are actual baseballs imprinted with color pictures of either players from the 
A's or the Reds, and bear the 1990 World Series logo nd team seal. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before the Oct. 16 start of the World Series, employees at Fotoball 
USA began working overtime at the company's Rose Canyon plant, cranking out 
more than 3,000 series balls a day. The company does not expect to slow down 
until sometime this week, said Michael Favish, Fotoball's 42-year-old 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The roster balls are imprinted with the team seal and a player roster. To 
commemorate their four-game sweep of the series, the Cincinnati Reds' balls are 
stamped World Champions as well as 1990 National League Champions. The Oakland 
balls bear the 1990 American League Champions stamp. Working 12-hour shifts, 
the company has been filling orders as fast as it can, said Derrick Favish, 
Michael's 38-year-old brother and business partner. 
</P>
<P>
The balls were sold for about $13 at the Oakland Coliseum, Cincinnati's 
Riverfront Stadium, via The Home Shopping Network on cable television and in 
gift shops around the country, Favish said. On Monday, orders were still coming 
in, and at last count, the company had sold 20,000 balls. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the series out of the corner of his eye on an office television last 
week, Favish said sales of World Series balls will represent about 10% of the 
company's estimated $2.3 million in sales this year. The company, which opened 
its doors in March, 1989, grossed about $860,000 in 1989 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
During the rest of the year, the company's 23 employees are busy pumping out 
player balls and roster balls of league teams and limited-edition autograph 
balls, Favish said. The company has also diversified into Fotopucks, hockey 
pucks with players' pictures, team crests and career highlights; football 
Fotoballs; and Fotosweats, or sweatbands imprinted with baseball players' 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The autographed baseball series includes balls signed by Tony Gwynn of the 
Padres; Johnny Bench, Cincinnati Reds' Hall of Fame player; and Jerome Walton, 
a Chicago Cubs' outfielder. "We did a limited, hand-signed edition of the Wayne 
Gretzky Fotopuck which sold out in six weeks for $199 a piece," Favish said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fotoball concept got its start in 1985 with a soccer ball, he said. "I 
built the first prototype on my living room floor." 
</P>
<P>
Favish, a native of South Africa, had sold his interest in a Beverly Hills art 
gallery the year before. "I was kind of at loose ends for a couple of months, 
and this thing came up and I had some time to spend on it. That was very 
fortunate because it took a lot of time and effort." 
</P>
<P>
"I played soccer as a child, and I was very involved with my kids' youth 
programs in Los Angeles. The idea for imprinting balls came from a toy soccer 
ball that had animal characters on it. One of my brothers said, why couldn't 
somebody put players on it instead. A penny dropped, and I started fiddling 
around with paints and tapes and all the things that make a prototype." 
</P>
<P>
But selling the soccer-ball concept proved too difficult because the main 
market at the time was in Europe, Favish said. So, Favish turned his energies 
to finding a color process to print photos on baseballs. "That in itself was a 
full-time task," Favish said, adding that printing on a soccer ball was child's 
play compared to a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
It was a much easier task to print on the 32-panel soccer balls before they 
were assembled, he said. "Baseballs couldn't be done that way. You had to print 
on the baseball once it was already fabricated in the round. So, to come up 
with a process, took my brother and me half of 1987 and all of 1988. I'm a real 
fusspot when it comes to quality." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers went to Italy to work with engineers there to fabricate the 
printing machines to their specifications. They had to draw from several 
different types of machines because what they needed did not exist, Favish 
said. "The machines are one of a kind." 
</P>
<P>
The company has an international flavor, Favish said. "We've got an American 
sports product being made by two South African guys using Laotian labor, 
Italian machines and balls made in China. We're all equal rights here." 
</P>
<P>
The company now has three major league baseball licenses, three National 
Football League licenses, and two National Hockey League licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Professional sports licensing is a major industry, Favish said. Last year, 325 
companies that bought rights from major league baseball grossed more than $1 
billion from retail sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But getting a license is no small feat, Favish said. The products are closely

"People are always wondering where my Ferrari is. It's not ready to be driven 
up to the front door yet," Favish said. "The bigger you get, the more money you 
need. (It) costs plenty to do what we do. You have to have balls to print on, 
you have to have packaging to put the finished product into. We need additional 
staff, shipping crates and cartons. The number of employees has grown from 
three to 23." 
</P>
<P>
"Going from a two-product line to a nine-product line is like starting a new 
business," Favish said. "You don't just put nine products in your product 
catalogue and rake in the money. It's not that way." 
</P>
<P>
Getting the products to market is the company's biggest challenge, Favish said. 
Using a network of representatives and distributors, the baseball Fotoballs are 
sold in outlets ranging from Wal Mart stores and airport gift shops to baseball 
card stores and sporting goods stores. 
</P>
<P>
Favish said his company is targeting sales of $4 million next year. "Whether we 
achieve it or not will be a function of our ability to bring the products to 
market," he said.

<HEAD>Soccer Headers Can Result in Brain Damage, Study Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Oslo University medical student says he's
determined that soccer players who use their heads to strike at
balls are risking brain damage.
   Thirty percent of retired Norwegian soccer players were found to
have signs of minor brain damage from ``heading'' balls, according
to the survey medical student Alf Thorvald Tysvaer conducted for
his doctoral thesis.
   Tysvaer said in an interview with the news agency NPK that 3
percent of the active Norwegian soccer players he studied also
showed symptoms of brain damage. Soccer balls can travel at more
than 60 mph.
   But Willy Simonssen, assistant head of Norway's Soccer
Federation, said such widespread damage appeared unlikely.
   ``I have not noticed it in my meetings with players,'' he said.
   In the study, former players complained of headache, dizziness
and irritability and some had problems with pain in the neck,
Tysvaer was quoted as saying. He said those were symptoms of
chronic, or permanent, brain damage.
   But the brain changes he recorded were not as severe as those
suffered by boxers, Tysvaer said.
   NPK said in the report Monday that Tysvaer's study included 69
active Norwegian division players and 43 former national team
members.

   Soccer and golf are growing in popularity. 
So why can't soccer golf win a following, wonders Albert O. Fenyvessy. 

   The 78-year-old retired real-estate developer from Rochester, N.Y., has been trying, to no avail, to groom soccer-golf devotees for the past three decades. 

   Soccer golf consists of a series of nets spaced a couple of hundred feet apart -- on par with golf-course holes -- and each net is suspended five feet off the ground on a tripod. 
The player kicks a soccer ball to each net and then hoists the ball, by foot, into the net, with as few kicks as possible. 

   Mr. Fenyvessy was encouraged initially. 
After inventing the sport in 1957, he wrote to the late Dr. Paul Dudley White, a noted cardiologist, who endorsed the game as a balanced and safe exercise. 
Mr. Fenyvessy then convinced Rochester officials to let him set up a few nets in a city park. 
He was the only one who played, however. 

   "I thought I must be crazy, so I quit," he says. 
But when the fitness craze gained momentum in the 1980s, Mr. Fenyvessy decided to have another swing at promoting the sport. 
"Soccer golf didn't seem any crazier than jogging," he says. 

   He hosted the First Annual Soccer Golf Tournament at the University of Rochester stadium in 1982. 
Although four-player teams from five area colleges were to compete, only three teams showed up. 
There's yet to be a second tournament. 

   Last year, he bought a quarter-page ad in the Washington Post's weekly edition to extol the benefits of soccer-golf: It's a "priceless, no-nonsense sport, powerfully simple with no fancy trappings." 
The ad included the number for the soccer-golf hot line, but only two people called. 

   He even offered to donate $2,000 to the Republican Party if he could hold a soccer-golf demonstration, with President Reagan attending, on the White House south lawn. 
The president, the White House replied, is too busy. 

   Locally, he spent $1,000 for two pilots to pull banners reading "Try Soccer Golf, not Drugs" and "Try Soccer Golf, Rochester's Own Sport" over the city. 
Now he's offered to give $25,000 in soccer-golf equipment to any group willing to use it. 

   Still, the game remains virtually unknown. 
"Gosh, I've never heard of it," says Michael Roche, parks program coordinator for Monroe County, where Mr. Fenyvessy lives. 
"If anyone cared about it, I think I would have heard." 

   Mr. Fenyvessy remains undaunted. 
"I don't think I should give up now. 
I may try Buffalo."

SANTA PAULA SOCCER TEAM RELYING ON HARD WORK IN ITS QUEST FOR A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT BUTWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Players from the Santa Paula High soccer team approached Coach Joe Magdaleno 
before the season with a special request. 
</P>
<P>
The players weren't seeking new uniforms, fancy sweat suits or soccer balls. 
Indeed, some coaches might be shocked by what the team asked for: A kick in the 
butt. 
</P>
<P>
"Each player said, 'Joe, we want you to work the team real hard and get us back 
to where we were two years ago,' " Magdaleno recalled last week. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it's working. The Cardinals are 5-2 against a tough lineup of nonleague 
opponents and begin their Frontier League schedule Friday at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula won the Southern Section 1-A Division championship in 1987, but 
lost in the quarterfinals to Hemet, 3-2, last year. The Cardinals' reaction to 
the loss shows why they are traditionally one of the top teams in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"The soccer team has a reputation in town and we take a lot of pride in Santa 
Paula of soccer," forward Dustin Magdaleno, the coach's son, said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the elder Magdaleno started the program in 1980, Santa Paula has won five 
league titles and has missed the playoffs only once. Four times it has reached 
the semifinal round before losing. 
</P>
<P>
"The things I stress more than winning are pride, discipline and respect," 
Magdaleno said. "If you have that, you can accomplish anything in life." 
</P>
<P>
Magdaleno has only one team rule: No swearing. A few bad words, and a player 
can find himself off the team. 
</P>
<P>
"If a player gets to a point where he's swearing at an opponent or referee, 
he's not going to be successful." Magdaleno says he never cuts anyone who tries 
out for the team, and he tries to play as many players as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as a player is willing to practice hard, he is on the team," Magdaleno 
said. "And if we get up by three goals by halftime, I try to let everybody 
play." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals also benefit greatly from the Hispanic heritage of Santa Paula, a 
city where 60 percent of the population is Latino. Soccer is the national 
pastime in Spain and most of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my players grew up with a soccer ball and learned from their dads, 
uncles and brothers," Magdaleno said. "By the time they get to high school, 
some of them are showing me tricks." 
</P>
<P>
Dustin Magdaleno, Carlos Elizarraraz and Juan Carlos Rodriguez, among others, 
compete in a local summer league against older players, many of whom work as 
field hands during the week. 
</P>
<P>
Many players come back to practices after graduation from high school and 
scrimmage against the current team. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Magdaleno and Elizarraraz, the team captains, tell their teammates 
about the 1987 championship team, on which they played as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep telling us how great winning the championship felt and how hard they 
worked," fullback Jamie Johnson said. "It gets us pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson went out for the cross-country team -- which is also coached by 
Magdaleno -- last spring to be in better shape for soccer. Magdaleno said the 
work ethic of his players stems from the fact that many worked in the area's 
orange, lemon and avocado groves -- work that makes the discipline of soccer 
seem easy by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids that come out for soccer have grown up where they have to work for 
everything they want," he said.

OLD-FASHIONED WAY: The soccer team at Santa Paula High delivered an unusual 
request to Coach Joe Magdaleno recently -- the players asked him to work them 
hard. They said that is the only way to win a Southern Section title.

<TEXT>     The Aero Sport falls into the category of "toss and catch" products.
Instead of a ball or disc, however, you throw a nine-inch soft plastic
dartlike object called an airfoil. The purpose of the game is to successfully
catch the airfoil and fling it to the other player.;    Catching the airfoil
is tricky. It has a soft suction cup on its nose and you use the Aero-Pad, an
impact-absorbent hand-held paddle, to field it. This nine-inch disc attaches
to the palm and acts as a target for the airfoil's suction-cupped nose.;   
Playing Aero Sport requires basically no training, and after a few minutes,
even a rookie can soar the aerodynamic airfoils with amazing accuracy to a
companion 50 feet to 100 feet away.;    The Aero Sport, $30 a pair, is
designed for players 12 and up. For more information, call (800) AERO-NOW.;   
Catch the tail;  Another entry into the "toss and catch" category is Klutz's
new Foxtail. This product is a cowhide-covered soft rubber ball attached to a
30-inch windsock tail.;    The Foxtail started out as an invention of Mike
Callaghan, an Arizona high school teacher who observed students playing with a
softball knotted into the toe of a sock. Callaghan explained, "They were
winging the thing all over the playground, having a great time. It looked like
so much fun that I went back home and began tinkering with ways to improve the
durability of the idea.";    To play, just send a partner 40 yards or so
downfield, grab the nylon tail, take two or three good round-the-world swings,
and let it fly. Your partner leaps up, letting the ball fly by and grabbing
the tail to make the catch. In fact, that is the only rule to playing Foxtail
-- all catches and throws are made by the tail.;    The Foxtail costs $10. For
more information, call (415) 424-0739.;    Solo soccer;  Although these
products require two or more players, one exception to the two-player rule is
Sports Mates' Soccer Mate.;    This metal-framed device is designed for one or
more players to practice soccer skills. To play, just kick a soccer ball onto
the nylon mesh target area. Because the Soccer Mate target is slanted, it not
only catches the ball but returns it to the kicker.;    Soccer Mate doesn't
need batteries or electricity, so it's ideal for the back yard. Because it
takes up only a 4-by-4-foot area, it also can be used indoors. It weighs less
than 25 pounds and folds flat for easy storage.;    The Soccer Mate sells for
$110. For more information, call Sports Mates at (704) 821-6099.  </TEXT>

  [Text] Boron-rich semiconductors have unique three centered 
covalent bonds and eight kinds of crystalline structures with 
icosahedral clusters (B[.sub]12[/]). Though other seven 
elemental semiconductors, e.g., Si, P, Se, have rather simple 
bonding nature, i.e., sp[.sup]3[/], p[.sup]3[/], 
p[.sup]2[/], only boron has such complicated bonds. Aluminum 
is an element which belongs to the same third group as boron and 
has the same icosahedral cluster (Al[.sub]12[/]) in metallic 
quasicrystalline alloys. On the other hand, C[.sub]60[/] 
molecular solid is also an elemental semiconductor which has 
almost sp[.sup]2[/] bond and C[.sub]60[/] cluster has an 
icosahedral symmetry. Bonding nature between C[.sub]60[/] is 
van der Waals type, though that between clusters in boron-rich 
semiconductors is covalent. It is interesting to investigate the 
interrelation between boron-rich semiconductors, aluminum-based 
quasicrystalline metals and C[.sub]60[/] molecular solids. 
Boron-rich solids are considered to be candidates for a 
semiconducting quasicrystal. 
  Quasicrystals have been found in many kinds of, but only 
metallic alloy systems. Boron-rich solids are considered to be 
icosahedral approximate crystals which have the same local 
structures as an icosahedral quasicrystal. Analyzing the 
crystalline structure of _a_- and _b_- rhombohedral boron as 
approximates, atomic structures of two unit cells of the 
icosahedral quasicrystal are constructed. Based on cohesive 
energy calculated by the molecular orbital method, the 
_a_-rhombohedral boron type quasicrystal can be realized. Among 
the (_a_-rhombohedral type structures, the distortion of 
B[.sub]12[/] is the smallest and rhombohedral axis angle is 
close to the icosahedral angle for the B-C system. A search for 
semiconducting quasicrystal has been experimentally done in the 
B-C system. A new type of approximate phase of icosahedral 
quasicrystal has been found on the way to crystallization of the 
B[.sub]95[/]C[.sub]5[/] amorphous phase. 
  The crystalline structure of the _b_-rhombohedral boron is 
considered to have B[.sub]84[/] soccer-ball clusters at 
vertices of the rhombohedral unit cell. The B[.sub]84[/] 
cluster is constructed of B[.sub]60[/] outer soccer-ball 
shell and B[.sub]24[/] inner double icosahedral. This 
crystalline structure is essentially the same as the face 
centered cubic structure of C[.sub]60[/]. Though lattice 
constants are almost the same (about 1 nm), soccer-balls have 
larger diameters and are closer to each other for the _b_-boron 
than for C[.sub]60[/]. This corresponds to that bonds between 
the C[.sub]60[/] clusters are van der Waals type and those 
between B[.sub]84[/] clusters are covalent. In spite of this 
different bonding nature, energy band gaps are similar (about 
1.5 Ev) for bothmaterials. Though electrical conductivity and 
magnetic susceptibility of alkali metal doped C[.sub]60[/] is 
metallic and shows superconducting transition, those of the 
_b_-boron remain to be semiconductive up to several percent 
metal doping and the conductivity has a variable-range hopping 
type temperature dependence. For the _b_-boron, the Fermi level 
is pinned at the localized intrinsic acceptor level and a 
carrier may form a bipolaron.

<LEADPARA>  For those of you scoring at home, Candlestick Park's performance as host of
this weekend's Copa International soccer tournament may be as important as the
four teams playing in it.;    When the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks open the
tournament against the Guatemala national team at 7 p.m. Friday, it will be
the first time a soccer ball has been kicked at Candlestick Park in at least
15 years. And former Santa Clara University soccer coach Steve Sampson, now a
member of the U.S. World Cup '94 Organizing Committee staff in Los Angeles,
said officials will be there to see how well Candlestick is suited to the
sport.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We don't have any expectations in terms of attendance," Sampson said
Tuesday. "If they get around 15,000 a night, we'd be happy with that. We'll
look at the logistics of the field and how the spectators are taken care of,
in terms of viewing the event. What we'll really look closely at is the
playing surface.";    Candlestick won't have on its best face, said Peter
Bridgwater, co-chairman of the committee trying to bring some part of the '94
World Cup to the Bay Area.;    Because the tournament is being played during
the Giants' baseball season, the field will be 72 yards wide, three yards
short of World Cup requirements, and, "A good portion of the baseball field
will be in the soccer field," Bridgwater said. "There isn't time to grass over
the infield. But I know we can get 75 yards out of it if we have a little more
time.";    Sampson said officials would take the conflict with the Giants into
consideration.;    "If this were a World Cup event, our expectations would be
10 times higher," he said.;    The Bay Area committee is touting Candlestick
and Stanford Stadium as sites for the '94 World Cup, the first held in the
United States. Stanford drew 31,761 for a match between the U.S. national team
and Argentina in May and an estimated 61,000 for a U.S. match against the
Soviet Union national team in February 1990.;    Bridgwater hopes to draw
15,000 to 20,000 for Friday's first-round doubleheader -- El Salvador's
national team meets Chivas of Guadalajara, Mexico, in the second game -- and
20,000 to 25,000 for Sunday's final at 4 p.m.;    Asked what Candlestick's
infamous wind gusts might do to a soccer ball, Bridgwater said, "We're
wondering the same thing.";  ETC.: For those interested in seeing a game
Saturday -- Copa International's day off -- the Northern California Cup final,
featuring the San Jose Oaks and the Sons of Italy, will be played at 11 a.m.
Saturday in San Francisco's Balboa Stadium. . . . Former Santa Clara

<HEAD>Father Finds Children Playing with Human Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three boys unwittingly used a wrapped-up human
head as a soccer ball before the father of one of the youngsters
realized what it was, police said today.
   The head, found in the South Bronx on Saturday, may belong to a
torso discovered along in a wooded area in Manhattan on March 4,
police said.
   The boys, ages 9, 10 and 13, apparently pulled the head wrapped
in rags out of a box of trash next to a fire hydrant on a dead end
street, said police spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Wrensen.
   ``The kids started to play soccer with the object and then threw
it into a trash can containing a fire,'' she said.
   Ralph Rodriguez was washing his car at the hydrant, Wrensen
said. After the object went into the fire, Rodriguez noticed a leg
sticking out of a garbage bag in the box and realized what the
``ball'' was.
   He looked closer and found arms and legs, police said.
   Area residents call the block ``the morgue,'' because five
bodies have been found there in the past two years, the Daily News
reported.

the shadow of the Beach Boardwalk.;    The Familia Center and the local patrol
officers who have volunteered their time and money to get the project off the
ground have no prior experience running a soccer program. They have virtually
no budget and even less equipment.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  YOUTH SOCCER LEAGUE BORN IN BEACH FLATS ON HOPE, SHOESTRING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 4/1/91, pg. 2B);  A story in Friday's
Mercury News should have said Santa Cruz's city parks and recreation
department donated $250 to the Beach Flats Youth Soccer Program. Because of a
reporter's error, incorrect information was given.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Their makeshift field, a grassy vacant lot at Third Street and Park Place,
normally doubles as a parking lot for amusement park visitors.;    But come
this summer, they say, about 40 children ages five to 12 and their parents
will participate in a casual league expected to provide not only exercise, but
an overdue boost of community self-esteem.;    "The kids here see so much
poverty and violence," said Marcos Rodriguez, executive director of the
Familia Center. "But a lot of them are great kids -- all they need is some
hope and attention.";    Rodriguez has more than a passing familiarity with
poverty and violence. Operating in Santa Cruz's highest crime area, just three
blocks from the popular Beach Boardwalk, Familia Center provides health care,
housing information and immigration assistance to the Beach Flats' 2,500
residents, 60 percent of whom are Hispanic.;    Last fall, after noticing how
many young children always seemed to be kicking tattered balls around in the
streets, Rodriguez and police Sgt. Tom Vlassis came up with the idea for a
structured soccer league.;    Because there are no large parks in Beach Flats,
Vlassis -- who has walked a beat in the area for three years -- convinced the
Seaside Company to donate the Third Street parking lot.;    When city leaders
said they couldn't run the league because of insurance liability concerns, the
Santa Cruz Police Officers Association donated $500 to buy an insurance
policy. Seaside kicked in an additional $250.;    Seaside spokeswoman Ann
Parker said the lot only is used on the busiest summer weekends when other
lots fill up.;    "We won't need to use it more than about 18 or 20 times a
year," Parker said.;    Many of the families in Beach Flats emigrated from
Mexico or El Salvador. As a result, their children often are left out of Santa
Cruz's private youth soccer leagues because of language barriers or
transportation problems.;    "These kids are somehow always left out,"
Rodriguez said. "But we've got a lot of future Peles here.";    The league
represents a bright opportunity for police as well.;    If young children can
be supervised and given a positive avenue for their energies, some might avoid
gangs, said Deputy Police Chief Mike Dunbaugh.;    A few officers have said
they would volunteer off-duty time as referees and coaching assistants, a move
certain to improve their image in the area as well.;    But the league is
still desperately in need of adult volunteers, including people who know the
rules of soccer and who can speak Spanish. It also needs soccer balls,
T-shirts and plastic fencing.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; To donate time, materials
or money to the fledgling soccer league, call the Familia Center at (408)
423-5747.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  IT WAS only a year ago that one of the world's leading soccer officials spoke
these prophetic words about Diego Armando Maradona:;    "I am afraid he will
wind up like Joe Louis," the man said, referring to the way the great

broken by financial and emotional troubles.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GOLDEN KID OF WORLD SOCCER GOES INTO FREEFALL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  George Vecsey is a columnist for the New York Times
Voices  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Boxing and world soccer are not dissimilar, in that they offer a quick way
out of poverty, but without the chance of some random education and peripheral
contacts that U.S. team sports offer.;    Almost all U.S. team athletes pass
through high school, probably a junior college, often a four-year university,
where they may even attend classes. The richest and most arrogant U.S. team
athletes know there is another world outside their arena. Maradona was a world
unto himself.;    Diego Armando Maradona went directly from a hard barrio at
the edge of Buenos Aires, Argentina, to a soccer club. His education ended
when he was around 12. In the world's professional soccer system, young
players are like novices in feudal guilds. They shine shoes, hang around,
perform menial chores, learn their craft.;    But Maradona had such rare
powers in his feet (and, when necessary, in his hands) that he bypassed the
servitude stage. He became a child star, responsible to nobody.;    The
30-year-old "golden kid" tested positive for cocaine the other day, and is
facing a two-year ban from his club in Naples, Italy, his national team in
Argentina and all over the world.;    The potential exile will be the start of
Maradona's freefall, but he has been slipping out of control for years. It
wasn't just the way he acted like a crude rustic when he played in urbane
Barcelona, Spain, or his gaudy midseason wedding (his two children were his
flower girls), at which he punched out a photographer, or the paternity suit,
or the inattention to work, which is often a screaming sign of addiction.;   
While Argentina was training for its World Cup defense in Italy last summer at
a secluded camp in the countryside, he would pop into Rome after midnight.
Suddenly, the patrons would be asked to eat fast, and the doors were closed to
keep other night people out.;    When all was secure, Maradona would enter
from a side door, take a corner table and order his midnight feast of pasta
and meat, bread and wine. Francis Ford Coppola could not have created a better
scene of raw power.;    Unfortunately for Maradona, he then had to go out and
play.;    For the entire decade of the '80s, Maradona had been the greatest
team athlete in the world, an artist as well as a 5-foot-6 raging bull with
the low-slung center of gravity of a luxury sports car and massive thighs that
could propel a soccer ball in vicious spinning tangents.;    Now he was
surrounded by defenders who kicked and jabbed at him, and all he had left was
histrionics. Cynically, he began taking dives on the lush green fields of
Italy. He tumbled and rolled and clutched at his ankles and his knees and his
thighs, writhing and moaning, a great soccer player reduced to a bad actor.;  
 When he was on his feet, he was arguing with officials, his stubby arms
making the elaborate gestures of an Argentine street dude, trying to cut
deals, plead his case, cop a plea, score some sympathy. He was pathetic.;   
His only true note of genius was a five-second spurt late against Brazil, when
he suddenly broke out of a crowd, dribbled the ball with a quick little dance
from memory, and then passed the ball to a fleet teammate who was able to
score the only goal of the evening.;    Since then, it has been downhill to
disgrace.;    The way it looks now, the place to look for Maradona will
probably be the street. A greeter in a hotel? If he's lucky.  </TEXT>

MISSION VIEJO'S JOE-MAX MOORE PLAYS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joe-Max Moore of Mission Viejo High School is one of the best soccer players in 
Orange County. But Moore, a senior midfielder, would be difficult to pick out 
on the practice field for those who don't know him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that kid over there with thick thighs corded with muscle, reminiscent of 
Pele, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 No. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, is he that guy, the fast one?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, no. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the quintessential Southern California kid brother, too young to 
drive, standing at the bus stop, body board in tow, waiting to catch a bus to 
catch some waves. 
</P>
<P>
That's Moore. 
</P>
<P>
He is not exactly scrawny, but to call him compact would give him credit for 
more brawn than he actually possesses. 
</P>
<P>
But the 5-foot-7, 130-pound Moore is definitely a keeper who gives goalkeepers 
fits. His 24 goals and 10 assists have helped the Mission Viejo soccer team 
advance to the Southern Section 3-A semifinals for the first time. Mission 
Viejo (23-1-3) plays host to St. Francis (17-1-1) at 3 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He really is small, but in the two years he has been playing here, he has 
never been hurt," Mission Viejo Coach Cal Foster said. "He's like a rubber 
ball. He just bounces right back up off the ground and keeps playing." 
</P>
<P>
He said Moore is the best player he has seen in his three seasons as the 
Diablos' coach. He and many of his colleagues see Moore -- the South Coast 
League player of the year this season -- as "one of the few players around who 
could go to a Division I college and start despite his size." 
</P>
<P>
And he does not compensate for his stature with blazing speed. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is fast, but at least five of his teammates at Mission Viejo are faster. 
What sets him head and shoulders above bigger competition is his knowledge of 
the game, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
"His skills are extraordinary," Foster said. "The way he can control a ball, 
his traps, his moves with it, the way he dribbles, his touch on the shot . . . 
he knows what other people are going to do. He is thinking two to three moves 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
His lack of size does not faze Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't affect my game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"High school people try to take you down a lot more, but I don't really feel I 
get knocked around or off the ball that much." 
</P>
<P>
Others agree. Southern Methodist University and UCLA, to name a couple of 
schools, are recruiting him. And he has been the starting center midfielder for 
two seasons on the Western Regional 18 1/2-and-under team, a squad of 20 elite 
athletes selected from 14 Western states. He has traveled to Brazil with 
another all-star team three times, and spent three months on his own playing in 
Yugoslavia. He plays club soccer for the North Huntington Beach Untouchables. 
</P>
<P>
While his size has never been a problem on the soccer field, it has been cause 
for pause off it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been pulled over twice by police thinking I wasn't old enough to drive," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
His equanimity about his size comes from his dad, Carl -- a former triple A 
baseball catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Carl was a 5-foot-4, 123-pound wrestler his senior year in high school. By the 
time he was 19, he had grown 6 inches and gained 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"For this boy to have kept up with all the big boys while being way behind in 
(physical) maturation is unbelievable," Carl said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always just told him that one day everyone will be the same again. If you 
were fast as a little boy, you will be fast as an adult," Carl said. "Some of 
these kids grow up a little earlier than others." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe-Max: "I don't even shave yet, but I know I'm going to get bigger. 
That's for sure. My dad's 5-10 and I'll be bigger than he is." 
</P>
<P>
Moore did most of his growing up in Tulsa, Okla., where he tried several 
sports. He was a state wrestling champion at 39 pounds in second grade, Moore 
said. "It's big there. As soon as you get to a certain weight in Oklahoma, you 
start wrestling," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
But he did not like it. 
</P>
<P>
He played a little football, but he was too small. 
</P>
<P>
He took a swing at T-ball and was a star, said his mother, Corey. That 
developed into a stint with baseball before high school, but he eventually gave 
that up because the season conflicted with soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"He picked up the soccer ball when he was 3 years old and never has put it 
down," his mother said. "He chose soccer. You pick up something when you're 
really young like these Olympic players do, and if you just live with it, that 
becomes the thing you excel in." 
</P>
<P>
"This kid was scoring six goals a game when he was a little boy," Carl Moore 
said. "When he had to make a choice to play one or the other, he chose soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe-Max: "I like (soccer) more than all the other games I've played. It's 
the most popular sport in the world, so it has got to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is one of the main reasons his two biggest fans, his parents, moved his 
freshman year to California, where the weather accommodates soccer year-round. 
</P>
<P>
He started for Woodbridge's varsity soccer team his freshman and sophomore 
seasons. Woodbridge advanced to the quarterfinals in the playoffs his sophomore 
season, but lost key players to graduation for his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
Moore knew Mission Viejo's midfielder, Andy Wortrich, from club soccer 
competition between his sophomore and juniors years. Wortrich told Moore that 
Mission Viejo was going to have a good soccer team, so Moore moved into Mission 
Viejo's district. 
</P>
<P>
The move has been good for Moore and the Diablos, who also qualified for the 
playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing great about soccer is it's a team sport and they have all blended 
together as a team," Foster said. "There is no bickering or arguing among them. 
. . . When it comes to goal scoring, there is nobody who is selfish. They don't 
care who scores just as long as the team scores." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 field players, 15 have scored. Wortrich, who is 5-feet-5 and second 
in scoring with 13 goals and 14 assists, was surprised that Moore showed up at 
tryouts, but he welcomed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was a good player and had some of the best skills I had seen, and he 
was as small as I was so we had something in common." 
</P>
<P>
Moore not only fit right in with his teammates, but he has adopted the 
California life style. He even catches some waves in San Clemente in his spare 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"He came from Oklahoma, but he's from Southern California now," Wortrich said. 
</P>
<P>
And his size? Well, his parents have had doctors test him for his growth 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a lot more growing to do," his dad said. "He is going to be a lot 
bigger boy than anybody could imagine, and when that happens, the rest of the 
soccer world has a problem."

<TEXT>
Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F>
Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Article by Atsunobu Takeshita] </F>
  [Text] The stable existence of N60 was confirmed jointly by 
the National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research 
(NIMCR), Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, and Nissan 
Motor Co., Ltd. (Nissan Motor). Increasingly promising lately is 
the potential for N60, the molecule consisting of 60 nitrogen 
atoms bonded in a soccer-ball shape, to be used as rocket fuel 
capable of generating the world's highest thrust. Supercomputer 
simulation confirmed the existence of N60 as the ``nitrogen 
version'' of the newly emerging promising material, C60, made of 
60 carbon atoms. Although a ``considerable amount of time is 
required for synthesizing N60,'' its development has already 
begun. 
  NIMCR's Chief Researcher Takehiro Matsunaga, who proposed 
the 
N60 concept, says this: ``When I saw the crystalline structure 
of C60, I immediately sensed that the world's most powerful 
explosive could be made if the same structure could be applied 
to nitrogen atoms.'' 
  NIMCR and Nissan Motor are jointly developing the 
next-generation rocket fuel. The joint team has been in search 
of a compound capable of generating a sufficiently powerful 
thrust to propel heavy rockets faster and farther. 
  Although nitrogen exists as a stable gas, its compounds can 
become powerful explosives. TNT, today's most widely used 
explosive, is also a nitrogen-containing compound. 
  Compared with oxygen and hydrogen, the atomic bonding force 
in nitrogen is greater, and therefore, when the bond is 
destroyed, larger energy is released. In other words, if a 
compound can be synthesized from nitrogen atoms only, the 
compound can be a powerful explosive. 
  From that standpoint, the crystalline structure of the 
soccer-ball-like C60 was the ideal shape for explosive 
researchers. The joint group of NIMCR and Nissan Motor computed 
the atomic radius and the molecular bonding energy and confirmed 
the existence of N60, consisting of 60 nitrogen atoms, and N70, 
consisting of 70 nitrogen atoms. Furthermore, the group computed 
the magnitude of thrust when these molecules are used as rocket 
fuel. 
  The currently most advanced propulsion technology involving 
the reaction between liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen is to be 
used for space shuttles and the next Japanese-made large rocket 
H2, which is scheduled to be launched in February 1994 by the 
National Space Development Agency. The technology makes use of 
the heat that is released when oxygen and hydrogen react. 
  Specific impulse, an index of a rocket's efficiency, for H2 
is approximately 445 seconds. By computation, the group obtained 
a specific impulse of approximately 550 seconds, approximately 
20 percent better than the above value, for the predicted N60, 
despite the common knowledge that it is almost impossible to 
improve specific impulse by even one second with today's fuel 
technology. 
  Another advantage of N60 as rocket fuel is that it is a 
solid. By applying high heat or impact, the energy accumulated 
in the material is released instantaneously. The liquid fuel to 
be used for H2 is difficult to handle and has a potential for 
leaking. It has been reported that the U.S. National Aerospace 
Agency has experienced more than 5,000 accidents in the area of 
engine development. Chief Researcher Matsunaga says, ``There is 
no doubt in my mind that the new nitrogen compound, if 
synthesized, will be the new rocket fuel.'' 
  There seems to be no clue to the synthesis method for the 
compound. It took five years for the synthesis method for C60 to 
be found after the computer prediction had been made for the 
existence of the molecule. Actually, the carbon molecule was 
isolated from soot produced by the electric discharge between 
carbon electrodes. In contrast with the C60 molecule, which is 
in the shape of a nearly perfect soccer ball, the N60 molecule 
predicted by the joint group has an indentation involving more 
than 10 nitrogen atoms. Because of this distorted shape, the N60 
molecule is said to be easily destroyed and difficult to 
synthesize. 
  The C60 molecule was synthesized with a systematic approach 
by gradually increasing the number of carbon atoms on a molecule 
consisting of 12 carbon atoms that was already in existence. On 
the other hand, nitrogen molecules containing four, six and 20 
atoms showed excessive strain in simulation tests, and their 
stable existence was negated. 
  Section Chief Katsumi Tanigaki of the Exploratory Research 
Department, NEC Basic Research Institute, points out that 
``unless an epoch-making synthetic method is found, it will be a 
long road before we see the actual N60 molecule.'' He suggests 
that the group should ``first check the possibility of 
synthesizing a molecule consisting of carbon and nitrogen.'' 
  According to the super-computer simulation, the N60 molecule 
is supposed to generate the world's greatest explosive force. 
Although a long road of synthesis is ahead, we must hope for the 
best for future research. As Section Chief Tanigaki says, we 
must ``go for it, as long as its existence has been predicted.''

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Superconducting alkali-metal doped f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/] 
attracts experimental and theoretical interests. While, among 
the icosahedral boron solids, both _a_- and _b_-rhombohedral 
boron have crystalline structures similar to that of f.c.c. 
C[.sub]60[/] in their dimensions, as well. The disparities, 
however, between them are listed as follows. 

  -  The interaction between the soccer-ball clusters is 
covalent in _b_-B. 
  -  The soccer-ball cage of _b_-B is not empty 
(2 icosahedra are in it). 
  -  As for doping sites of _b_-B 
rhombohedron, two tetrahedral sites have almost the same size as 
those in f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/], while octahedral site is 
occupied with another boron cluster (there are two other kinds 
of sites in _b_-B). 
  This paper reports the study on the electronic properties of 
icosahedral boron solids in the way of doping electrons from 
alkali metal and other groups of metal. 
<H5>  Experimental </H5>
  Alkali metal was evaporated and doped into _b_-B crystal 
in 
sealed glass tube.[.sup]1[/] Cu and Al doped samples were 
precipitated from B, Cu and Al melts (I. Higashi, et al.). X-ray 
diffraction analysis was carried out for structural 
investigation, conductivity was measured in van der Pauw method 
and magnetic susceptibility was obtained by SQUID. 
<H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>
  The measured conductivity showed a variable range hopping 
type conduction rather than thermal activation type one, and the 
values at room temperature increased with increasing Cu and Li 
concentration. The magnetic susceptibility obtained was the 
superposition of diamagnetic component and Curie-Weiss type 
paramagnetic one. Up to about 2at.% of Cu concentration 
and 
after Li doping, doped electron showed little contribution to 
each component. 
  To clarify these properties, the band scheme of _b_-B is 
drawn qualitatively as follows. A localized intrinsic acceptor 
level islocated above the valence band. This level is thought to 
be originated from a split-off intramolecular orbital of an 
electron deficient B[.sub]12[/] distorted by the Jahn-Teller 
effect. Since doped electron occupies only this level, neither 
metallic conduction nor magnetism (Pauli paramagnetism as in the 
case of alkali metal doped C[.sub]60[/]) is observed. In 
addition, formation of singlet bipolaron at the level may 
prevent the electron to contribute to localized magnetic moment. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The crystalline structure of _b_-rhombohedral boron is 
essentially similar to that of f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/]. Doped 
electron in _b_-B shows variable range hopping type conduction 
and hardly contributes to magnetic susceptibility up to several 
atomic percentages. The electron occupies an intrinsic acceptor 
level originated from B[.sub]12[/] icosahedral cluster and 
may form bipolaron.

The lights had just been shut off at the San Diego Sports Arena following the 
Sockers' practice. Cory Fernandez, clutching a can of soda that looked gigantic 
in a 3 1/2-year-old's hands, was less than thrilled. He could have done without 
the sudden darkness. 
</P>
<P>
George Fernandez, the defender with the two-octave smile, "Dad" to Cory and 
"Keoki" to his family in Hawaii, patiently explained to his son that keeping 
the lights on costs money. That was good enough for Cory, who ran off to play. 
</P>
<P>
Cory is one of the responsibilities that have snuck up on Fernandez. Life has 
become complicated, certainly when compared with his childhood. He has to think 
about more than just soccer. More than just himself. 
</P>
<P>
A look back. 
</P>
<P>
Age 5. George Fernandez, born in California but often in Hawaii to visit 
relatives, spent most of his days running through the sugar cane fields with 
his dog, Lani. No worries. 
</P>
<P>
High school. Fernandez's focus was sports: soccer, football, badminton. He was 
a natural. Football was his favorite, though he was only 5-feet-7, 155 pounds 
as a senior. University of the Pacific offered him a football scholarship. He 
declined, deciding he didn't want to get his bell rung, and decided to play 
soccer at Cal State Hayward. No worries. 
</P>
<P>
College. Soccer became his life. School meant very little. Fernandez would skip 
classes and spend hours by himself dribbling and juggling a soccer ball, 
refining his skills. It paid off. He was a two-time All-American and considered 
one of the top college prospects in 1983. He was drafted by the Cleveland Force 
and the Chicago Sting. No worries. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the worries began. Fernandez decided to go to the balmy city of 
Cleveland after he took a trip to Chicago and nearly froze. He had brought only 
T-shirts to wear. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, the city, was great. Fernandez loved it. Cleveland, the team, wasn't 
so great. He played in just six games in two years. He says that set his career 
back several notches. His college coach, Colin Lindores, can only speculate as 
to why Fernandez didn't do better. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe their expectations were much higher than he performed," Lindores 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez made $50,000 in each of his two seasons in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was money I didn't earn," Fernandez said. "It was, like, a waste of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
He was released after the 1984-85 season. 
</P>
<P>
Next stop, Los Angeles. More worries. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez played in 64 games in two seasons with the Lazers. From a soccer 
standpoint, he was happier. But Los Angeles was not his idea of an ideal place 
to live. 
</P>
<P>
During training camp, the players would run on the beach at 7:30 a.m. Under 
normal traffic conditions, Fernandez said, it was a 45-minute drive. But this 
wasn't normal. He had to leave at 4:30 a.m. to get there on time. He hadn't 
seen traffic like that since he was in China with the Junior World Cup Team. 
There, he said, people drove at two or three miles an hour because there were 
so many people walking in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez formed some rather strong opinions about L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you," he says, "the psychologists up there must be making some big 
bucks. I spent more time driving than I did playing. It's the worst place to 
live. It's just mayhem 24 hours around the clock." 
</P>
<P>
OK, George, how do you really feel? 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible," he continues. "I can't see how people can live there." 
</P>
<P>
The fast lifestyle doesn't fit Fernandez's personality. Despite his enthusiasm 
during games, in which he might wave the towel to stir the crowd or jump up on 
the glass to slap hands with fans, Fernandez isn't the rock-and-roll, 
party-all-night type. He would much rather spend a quiet evening at home. 
Socker defender Gus Mokalis, Fernandez's roommate on the road, says sometimes 
they'll sit in the room for hours without talking. 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, Fernandez hasn't changed much since high school, when he would 
sit home a lot and watch sports on television, hardly saying a word. His 
parents used to try to get him out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to feel sorry for him because he wasn't one to go out with his 
friends," said Fernandez's mother, Lynette. "He'd sit with us on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's version? 
</P>
<P>
"I never dated because I was too afraid to ask them if I could go out for a 
date." 
</P>
<P>
He's still not much for a social life. "I've always been a loner," he said. "I 
have a good time by myself, read the newspaper. Nobody yapping in my ear." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is perfect. Reminds Fernandez of Hawaii. And it's here, for the first 
time in his professional career, that Fernandez is pleased with his role on a 
soccer team. He was one of three Sockers who played in all 48 regular season 
games in 1988-89. His teammates respect his ability and, perhaps more 
importantly, his intensity. Fernandez, said teammate Kevin Crow, stays at the 
same level throughout the game, giving the rest of the players a lift. 
Fernandez is also the best defender they have on the penalty-killing unit. 
</P>
<P>
It could be said that Fernandez had had a belly full of professional soccer by 
the time he came to San Diego. He was released by the Lazers, and he had become 
extremely wary of pro soccer in general. He'll never forget when the Lazers let 
two players go on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in this league shocks me," he says. "In this profession, I consider 
your job never safe." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Fernandez has found some security. Sockers Coach Ron Newman was impressed 
enough to select Fernandez out of 50 players who tried out for one spot before 
the '87-'88 season. Newman hasn't been disappointed. One gets the feeling 
Fernandez is one of his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"He has an infectious appetite for the game," Newman said. "He enjoys every 
second he's on the field. I'd shudder at the thought of not having him. He'd 
throw himself in front of a freight train if you asked him to. Brave as you can 
be. He's just a lovable character." 
</P>
<P>
And finally satisfied. Nothing sums it up better than the picture on this 
year's Sockers media guide. Fernandez is standing in the middle of his 
teammates, smiling like a butcher's dog. The Sockers MISL championship trophy 
is being held over his head. It's his first championship. What's the man behind 
the smile thinking? 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good to win a championship and have a ring and stick it in everybody's 
face that said I couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Got it? George Fernandez may keep to himself a lot. He may appear to be a nice, 
friendly guy who jokes with his teammates, gives his shirt or cap to a homeless 
person or spends time with kids teaching them soccer skills. But deep inside, 
there is an intensity. A desire to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win a championship, and I want to win it every year," he said. "A 
lot of people think I'm too into it. But I know what it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
He has the same intensity in all sports, not just soccer. He'll talk of playing 
tennis with his wife, Jennifer. She doesn't hit the ball over the net 
consistently enough for George. It's no challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Take lessons," he'll tell her. "Get better, or I'm not going to play." 
</P>
<P>
He's also a pinball wizard. 
</P>
<P>
"Like a little kid sometimes," Jennifer says. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the intensity is also unselfishness. In high school, Lynette says, George 
would often pass the ball to other players to allow them a chance to score 
goals. Sometimes people would say 'You shouldn't have passed that ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted those kids to be in the limelight," Lynette said. 
</P>
<P>
Just this year, Fernandez has become more secure with what he will do with 
himself after he is out of pro soccer. Teammate Brian Quinn quips: "He's at his 
peak now. He can't go anywhere else except down." 
</P>
<P>
Funny. But there's some truth to that too. Fernandez, 27, is coming off his 
finest season. He was chosen defensive star of the game four times, selected 
the MISL's defensive player of the week earlier this month and was recently 
chosen by his teammates as the Sockers most improved player with forward Paul 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
What's next? 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Fernandez wondered if he would have to flip hamburgers or pump gas 
to provide for his family when he was no longer able to play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't worry him anymore. He's taking classes. Preparing for life after 
soccer. He plans to go into commercial real estate or maybe become a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first year that he's really looking ahead," Jennifer says. 
"(Before) he just wanted to play soccer." 
</P>
<P>
So he'll play as long as he can, or as long as he can play the way he wants to 
play. Then he'll move on. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I was scared, nervous," he said. "Now I can deal with it. I have no 
worries."

<LEADPARA>  FOR SEVEN years, this city, among the poorest and roughest in Western Europe,
has had a hero. His name: Diego Maradona.;    The relationship has been a
fairy tale of sorts. But the ending appears imminent, and it is a sour one,
shaped by cocaine. Maradona, one of the world's most celebrated soccer
players, faces suspension from his sport for use of the illicit drug.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SOCCER STAR'S GLOW HAS GONE DIM AFTER HE
PUT NAPLES IN SPOTLIGHT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News wire services contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     On Wednesday the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera quoted him as saying
he will not play professional soccer again. "I had enough. I am tired of
struggling. I am retiring for good," he said.;    Megastar Maradona is among
the latest of a string of sports luminaries tripped up by cocaine: Boxer Sugar
Ray Leonard, who admitted Saturday that he used the drug for several years, is
another. But for Naples, this is no simple celebrity gossip tidbit. It is a
major blow.;    First, the city. Many of its 1.2 million people live in slums.
Last week, four people, two of them bystanders, were gunned down in a street,
in the sort of organized crime hit that is routine in Naples.;    In northern
cities like Milan, residents sometimes refer to the people of southern Naples
as "macaroni," a name that implies that they are dirty, poor, lazy and
uncivilized.;    Neapolitans, for their part, are proud -- of their emphasis
on family, food and home; of their Sophia Loren and their Enrico Caruso, and
of their seaside and sun. Many of them see the northern Italians as arrogant
and cold.;    But in Naples, there was no getting around the soccer problem.; 
  In a country where who you are is sometimes measured by who your team is,
Naples' soccer team long had a home in the bottom rankings of the major teams.
For decades, soccer fans in Italy's northern cities -- in particular, Milan
and Turin -- took considerable satisfaction as their teams regularly whomped
Naples in soccer.;    Those teams dominated the Italian league and the annual
tournament simply called "the cup" by most Italians. In the cup's seven-decade
existence, Naples had won but twice, and never the older, more prestigious
league championship. Neapolitans would turn on their television sets to see
Milan or Genoa mentioned for their soccer teams, Naples mentioned for its
latest multiple homicide.;    In 1984, Diego Maradona came to Naples.;    He
had come from the slums himself, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. For $12
million, a record at the time, the Naples soccer team got the 24-year-old
player from Barcelona, Spain. He was good -- very good -- but his prime was
still to come.;    And so began the fairy tale. It is said now in Naples that
God invented the soccer ball, gave it to Maradona and said, "Go show the
people how to use this.";     ON THE field, Maradona was fantasy. He didn't
play as much as he invented. His talent was breathtaking, his enthusiasm
extraordinary. Four opposing players could converge on him as he had the ball,
and like water he would seep through. Even for Italians who were not soccer
enthusiasts, Maradona was entertainment.;    "We watched Maradona and we
forgot about our problems," said Gennaro Chiocca, 38, a Naples police
officer.;    Maradona, called by many the world's greatest player of the
decade, took Naples to the top, winning, among other titles, the elusive
league title in 1987 and again last spring. It did the beleaguered city good:
Suffice it to say one can still see paint residue in some places where streets
were painted light blue, the team color, for last year's victory celebration.;
   On other fronts, Maradona led the national team of his native Argentina to
the 1986 World Cup, a quadrennial championship of national all-star teams.;   
Off the field, Maradona won Neapolitan hearts with his chiasso. The word means
"noise," and it is a characteristic of the Neapolitan life. He was from
Argentina, but he might have been born in Naples.;    Maradona liked the
discotheques. He liked pretty young women, and, according to various reports,
he liked prostitutes. He spent some of his soccer millions on two Ferraris and
two BMWs. He liked to stay out late, to sleep in. He was married two years ago
and claims two children, but Neapolitans have speculated of many others.;   
"Nobody is perfect," said Gaetano Bellavista, 51, a Naples bar owner. "As long
as Naples was winning, we forgave him.";    But in the past year, Maradona's
life seemed to get out of control. He frequently missed practice, sometimes
for days at a time. He became overweight. The team's performance began
slipping, and the team wound up back in the lower ranking.;    TWO MONTHS ago,
it was reported that his name arose in an investigation of drug trafficking
and prostitution in Naples. According to one account, jealous prostitutes told
police that Maradona used cocaine. He has denied using the drug.;    But a
test of his urine -- done two weeks ago and confirmed in a laboratory analysis
Friday -- showed traces of cocaine. Maradona is expected to be suspended from
playing in Italy and internationally for two months to two years.;    He left
Italy on Tuesday to return to his home country. The disciplinary commission of
the Italian league will rule on Maradona's penalty in Milan on Saturday.;   
Maradona's lawyer, Enzo Maria Siniscalchi, said he expects the minimum penalty
for Maradona, saying cocaine can't be considered performance-enhancing if
taken several hours before a game.;    "We will not appeal the sentence if
Maradona is given the minimum penalty," Siniscalchi told Gazzetta dello Sport,
a Milan sports daily.;    On the streets of Naples, Maradona, now 31, already
is being spoken of as a has-been. But Neapolitans have a hard time summarizing
how they feel about him.;    "He was not much of a man," said Barbara
Castaldo, 18.;    "He had a weak character. He did a lot of good for Naples,
but what he did lately, he has destroyed a lot of it. But we will always love
him because of what he was as a soccer player."  </TEXT>

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] The National Institute for Research in Inorganic 
Materials, STA, has succeeded in synthesizing diamond from 
fullerene crystals (C[.sup]60[/], soccer ball shaped carbon 
molecules) by using shock compression. The synthetic diamonds 
obtained by using fullerene crystals as a starting material are 
ultrafine particles about 10 nm in diameter. The yield is about 
50% of the starting material at about 20 GPa and when the 
pressure is increased to 50 GPa, the yield reaches almost 
90%. 
This yield is very high, about ten times the yields obtained 
using other forms of carbon (such as graphite, glassy carbon, 
etc.) 
  Conventional carbon materials are difficult to convert into 
diamond, even with shock compression. Even if diamond is formed, 
the yields have been low at less than 10%. On the other 
hand, 
methods for synthesizing large amounts of C[.sup]60[/] and 
C[.sup]70[/] fullerene crystals have been established, so 
they are now easy to obtain, and this has spurred activity in 
various types of experimental and theoretical research. 
  The No. 8 research group at NIRIM focused on fullerene 
crystals as a new starting material for diamond synthesis. In 
C[.sup]60[/] crystals, the C[.sub]60[/] molecules have a 
spherical, cage-like structure held together by Van der Waals 
forces, which are relatively weak. 
  The C[.sup]60[/] molecules form a dodecahedron consisting 
of 20 six-membered rings and 20 five-membered rings. The five- 
and six-membered rings in the molecules contain two different 
types of bond angles and bond lengths that are similar to the 
SP[.sup]3[/] bond configurations of diamond in some places. 
Therefore, the researchers hoped they would be easy to convert 
to diamond. 
  Following this line of thought, researchers used shock 
compression and successfully obtained high yields of synthetic 
diamond. 
  The fullerene starting materials were in the form of 
rectangular or hexagonal fine particles, and they were mixed 
with copper powder and pressure molded. The samples were 
subjected to a shock wave from a single-shot gun using a 
gunpowder cartridge and recovered in two containers made of 
different types of material, stainless steel and copper. Then 
the copper was removed from the sample by treating it with acid, 
and the phase was determined by X-ray diffraction of the sample 
powder. Results confirmed that synthetic diamond had been formed 
at a high yield. 
  This diamond takes the form of ultrafine particles similar 
to 
the diamond recovered from the carbon in gunpowder. The yield 
ranged from 50-90% of the starting material depending on 
the 
conditions of the shock compression. Researchers conducted 
synthesis on samples of mixed C[.sup]60[/] and 
C[.sup]70[/] molecules, and on C[.sub]60[/] molecules 
alone. 
  Researchers at NIRIM believe this product can be used for 
polishing mirror surfaces, etc., but they also believe the 
material costs will be too high. In these experiments the 
researchers went up to 90 GPa of pressure, but they found that 
when they surpassed 50 GPa, the synthetic diamond disappeared 
and was converted into another unknown substance. Researchers 
plan to work hard to clarify this phenomenon and proceed with 
the search for new post-diamond phase materials and 
superconductors.

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Jose Luis Villegas -- Mercury News; ON A ROLL -- Brandi
Chastain, once a star at Cal and most recently at Santa Clara University, is
now an important member of the U.S. national women's soccer team, which will
travel to China in November. (color)  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CLARA; COLLEGE; WOMAN; SOCCER; PROFILE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  ONCE in front of a goal, Brandi Chastain has never had much trouble putting a
soccer ball into it, a talent she ably demonstrated by nailing five in a row
in one game last month for the U.S. women's national team.;    The hard part
for her was doing all the things necessary to get in front of that goal --
such as staying in school or in shape or on the team. That Chastain scored
those five goals and is headed with the team to China for the World
Championships in November probably doesn't surprise anyone who knows her as
the 1990 women's national collegiate soccer player of the year who led Santa
Clara to a second consecutive NCAA Division I Final Four appearance.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SHE'S KICKING UP A STORM
CHASTAIN HAS PUT HER PROBLEMS BEHIND HER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Soccer  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It's a different story for those who remember her from four years ago as an
expelled Cal student with torn-up knee ligaments.;    "Sometimes I can't
believe it," Chastain said Thursday before leaving for a national team
training session in Colorado Springs, Colo. "I had fallen through the cracks.
I could see it slipping away.";    It was a steep and swift fall. After a
spectacular high school career in which she led Mitty to three consecutive
Central Coast Section titles, Chastain went to Cal. As a freshman, she led the
team in scoring with 15 goals and 14 assists.;    The faltering began with a
left-knee injury that spring, which forced her to undergo extensive
reconstructive surgery and miss her sophomore season. Her performance as a
freshman, however, had caught the attention of national team coach Anson
Dorrance. He put her on the team for a tournament in China a year later.;   
Chastain had the talent but not the drive to play at the international level.
Injuries forced Dorrance to play her anyway.;    "I was a basket case,"
Chastain recalled. "I was so nervous. I was thinking, 'I don't even want to
touch the ball.' I was hoping it wouldn't come to me. I was just occupying
space.";    Dorrance dropped her from the team after the tournament. To make
matters worse, Chastain had reinjured her left knee. She returned to Cal
unable to play soccer and uninterested in her classes, which resulted in her
expulsion.;    "Things were kind of falling apart for her," Santa Clara Coach
Jerry Smith said. "People lost interest in her. I think she just needed
somebody to say, 'We want you and we want you to do this.' She just needed the
motivation.";    Chastain spurned Smith's invitation at first, because she
considered Santa Clara's program inferior. Watching the Broncos play several
games during the fall of 1988 changed her mind. The knee injury and the need
to take a heavy load of courses at West Valley Community College didn't daunt
her. She rehabilitated her knee, improved her grades and enrolled at Santa
Clara in the fall of '89.;    "At Cal, there were too many people, not enough
time and too little space," she said. "I had a class that had 800 people in
it. I thought, 'No one will know if I don't go.' So I didn't. Santa Clara was
different.";    Chastain as a player wasn't. Her tremendous natural ability
with the ball was intact, and she led the Broncos with 10 goals and two
assists. But her work ethic disappointed Smith.;    "She used her knee as an
excuse," Smith said. "She had teammates that didn't respect her.";    Smith
called her into his office a few days before the 1989 regular-season finale, a
match against Colorado College, then ranked second in the nation. The Broncos
already had an NCAA playoff berth secured, but a win might earn them a
first-round bye.;    Smith told her she couldn't drop out of any more fitness
tests and that he didn't want her on the team if she did. Chastain said she
didn't need to be on his team and stormed out of his office.;    "That next
half-hour was probably the biggest turning point in my career," she said. "I
walked back to my apartment, thinking about what it would be like not to go to
practice the next day.";    What she feared was working hard and still not
reaching her potential.;    "In that way, I was scared . . . but I realized it
wasn't just me out there," she said. "I looked at myself and said, 'Are you
doing your best to help the team?' And I wasn't.";    Smith remembers that she
finished at the back of the pack in the next day's fitness drill -- but she
finished. And the next season she was first in fitness drills "90 percent of
the time," he said.;    Dorrance, meanwhile, noticed that Chastain scored 22
goals and had six assists in leading the Broncos to another Final Four
appearance.;    "She played a season in which she was scoring the important
goals," Dorrance said, "which is a sign of a player saying she'll carry a team
on her back. That's a sign of psychological strength.";    Dorrance invited
her to a training session in December, and, although her fitness regimen is
still a concern, he noted that she has improved. Right winger April Heinrichs
said, "I think she's undergone a metamorphosis in maturity.";    The five
goals didn't surprise Dorrance, because "Brandi has incredible tactical
creativity," he said. "In that area, she might be the most talented player on
the team.";    Chastain's explanation: "I was crossed balls that if I hadn't
scored I would have looked stupid. I was just in the right place.";    Finally.  </TEXT>

KICKING UP A NEW DEBATE;

<P>
LINGERING PREJUDICES RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF GIRLS' SPORTS 
</P>

LEWISVILLE, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At halftime of a recent soccer game here for girls under 12, two fathers of 
players on one team walked onto the field. Talking to the referee and the rival 
coach near the goal, one parent allegedly made a unique request. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted his wife to take three of our girls . . . into the bathroom and 
verify that they were girls," said Joe Johnson, coach of the Lewisville Blaze. 
"I said 'No way!' and probably a few other vulgar things. I got very upset. . . 
. The request was absurd." 
</P>
<P>
The story made its way into the local newspaper, the Lewisville Leader, and to 
the papers in Dallas and Ft. Worth, about 25 miles to the south. Soon it spread 
to Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, the Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Dudley Green, managing editor of the Leader, said the incident focused more 
attention on the rapidly growing community of 47,000 than any event since a 
Woodstock-style concert in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in town has been talking about it," said Mike Wood, president of the 
Lewisville Soccer Assn. "Last year we had about 1,900 kids playing soccer. You 
have roughly double that in parents, and you have grandparents and referees. 
It's been all over town." 
</P>
<P>
But the "panty check" story did not end there. Although the two fathers angrily 
denied the allegations, the North Texas State Soccer Assn. suspended one father 
from all games until the end of the fall season and banished the other until 
next September. 
</P>
<P>
And the incident raised perplexing questions about the future of girls' sports. 
Were the Texas fathers accused of making the remarks part of a small minority, 
or do they speak for a large but less vocal community of men who still can't 
accept girls as exceptional athletes? And would this highly publicized episode 
affect girls' willingness to compete, undermining decades of growing female 
participation in sports? 
</P>
<P>
Among a pediatrician and a dozen sociologists and psychologists contacted by 
The Times, a few said the incident could affect girls sports negatively. 
</P>
<P>
"If that thinking (of the fathers) prevailed," said Anne Marie Bird, chair of 
the physical education department at Cal State Fullerton, "little girls 
wouldn't go into sports because their femininity would be questioned. I think 
it would be very threatening (to women's sports.)" 
</P>
<P>
But the overwhelming majority viewed the alleged remarks of the Texas fathers 
as an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of incredulity that these men demonstrated borders on irrationality," 
said Don Sabo, a sports sociologist at D'Youville College in Buffalo, N.Y., and 
co-author of a recent book, "Sport, Men and the Gender Order." 
</P>
<P>
"The surveys done during the last decade indicate a tremendous shift in 
attitudes toward girls' participation in athletics," Sabo said. "Overall, 
parents are supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Snyder, a sports psychologist who is programs director of the Women's 
Sports Foundation in New York, said she didn't think the remarks would hurt 
girls' athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the same kind of incident as when (Los Angeles Dodgers general 
manager) Al Campanis made his remarks about blacks," she said. "We look at it 
and say it's outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be vigilant and make sure the opportunities are there for girls, 
but I don't think there is going to be a backlash." 
</P>
<P>
That was good news to Natasha Dennis, 10, the Lewisville Blaze goalie who was 
only 9 when she was apparently asked to prove she was a girl in the Sept. 29 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Next to Dennis' house, a few blocks east of Interstate 35 in Lewisville, is a 
wooden garage with paint chipping from the white siding. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis has appreciably aided the chipping on one wall by frequently lining up 
15 soccer balls on the dirt and kicking them one at a time against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she kicks for hours at night under the bright light extending upward 
from the garage roof. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening two fire trucks lumbered up her block, sirens screaming and 
bright lights flashing, and stopped in front of her house. Neighbors poured out 
of homes on both sides of the street to see what was wrong. Natasha never 
stopped kicking her soccer ball. The trucks had been called for a small stove 
fire in a house across the street. But for Dennis, only the competitive fires 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, who stands 4 feet, 5 inches tall, has been playing soccer five years. 
In addition to performing on Lewisville Soccer Assn. teams twice a year, she is 
the only girl who plays in boys soccer games at her school during recess. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it when other players come in on me getting ready to kick," said 
Dennis, who wore black soccer shoes with shorts and a T-shirt as she talked to 
a reporter in her living room recently. "I like being able to stop that. I like 
the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think girls can play better than boys if we try our best and practice." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Carpenter, a professor of physical education at Brooklyn College, said 
that the dedication Dennis shows is a hallmark of exceptional athletes -- male 
and female. 
</P>
<P>
"Excellence takes commitment and it takes the same kind whether you're male or 
female," said Carpenter, who attended Dorsey High School in Los Angeles and 
earned her Ph.D. from USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'd have to look pretty far to find an exceptional athlete who grew 
up not putting an extraordinary effort into that part of their life." 
</P>
<P>
Specialists say men are beginning to understand the efforts women make to 
excel, and that their understanding may be reflected in attitudes supporting 
girls athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Sabo and Snyder base their optimism about men's attitudes in large part on a 
1987 telephone study for the Women's Sports Foundation. Researchers contacted 
1,004 parents and 513 of their 7- to 18-year-old daughters. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that "parents show very little concern that sports may be 
unladylike." Ninety-seven percent of the fathers and mothers agreed that sports 
provide important benefits to girls. The idea that sports are equally important 
for boys and girls was generally accepted by 87%. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors, sociologists and psychologists said there was every reason to believe 
that girls 9 and 10 years old could play as well as, if not better than, boys. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Barbara Lippe, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the division of 
endocrinology at the UCLA Medical Center, said that the hormones that change 
boys' strength, such as testosterone, don't appear until puberty, which usually 
starts at 11 1/2 or 12. 
</P>
<P>
At the Women's Sports Foundation, Snyder agreed. "In third- and fourth-grade 
class pictures, girls are the tallest and often the strongest, and its not 
unusual for girls to be better athletes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took a bunch of girls and trained them exactly the same as boys until 
they reached 11 or 12, there's a good chance girls would beat boys." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to possessing abilities similar to boys, many young American girls 
have honed their skills in recent decades by competing in rapidly proliferating 
teams and leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The Women's Sports Foundation study reported that 87% of girls 7 to 10 and 84% 
of girls 11 to 14 are involved in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder added that 294,000 girls competed in high school sports in 1971, but the 
number increased to 1,839,000 girls along with 3,417,000 boys in 1988-89, the 
last year for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take out 950,000 (boys) playing football, we're getting a lot closer to 
parity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting girls' improvement in gymnastic scores and times for track events, 
Snyder said, "It shouldn't be surprising to anybody . . . that when you begin 
making opportunity available, girls have been improving at all levels of 
competition at a much faster rate than men over the last 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Carole Oglesby, a sports psychologist who chairs the department of physical 
education at Temple University in Philadelphia, says record-setting performers 
or other superb athletes won't be affected by disparaging remarks about their 
femininity. 
</P>
<P>
"If a young woman shows spectacular promise," Oglesby said, "then her parents 
and coaches will pick up on that and see all that collegiate or Olympic 
competition might offer. She's going to stay with it and get all the positive 
support that goes with those activities." 
</P>
<P>
Oglesby, a graduate of Baldwin Park High School and UCLA, said she's concerned 
that the barbs may drive away average performers who will miss the joys and 
lessons of competition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a large group of people in the middle of the normal curve of girls 
who will say if people are going to hassle me about this (femininity), I'm not 
going to stay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the spectacular athlete is the one that men have most trouble accepting, 
Sabo said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think about these two fathers in Texas, I picture them as very 
traditional males who have difficulty accepting a girl's athletic ability in 
non-stereotypical terms," Sabo said. 
</P>
<P>
"When this man sees a woman who can bench-press 220 pounds or run a five-minute 
mile, or who can kick his butt in volleyball or baseball, he has no category in 
his mind to put that kind of woman. So he has to turn her into a male to deal 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Harris, a sports psychologist and a professor of exercise and sports 
science at Penn State University, said many men think women are inferior 
athletes because those men have confused notions of skill and size or strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Steffi Graf, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati . . . who are superb 
tennis players and will be ranked as the best in the world, and yet a male 
ranked 50th could probably beat a woman ranked No. 1," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The men can have unorthodox strokes and be less skilled, but can compensate 
through strength and quickness. In many cases, women's matches are more 
interesting because there is more strategy." 
</P>
<P>
While Natasha Dennis can boot a soccer ball 40 or 50 yards, the slender goalie 
would hardly be considered powerful. 
</P>
<P>
She plays soccer because she likes it -- better than skateboarding, better than 
jumping on her trampoline and better than playing football with her 
neighborhood friends. 
</P>
<P>
She also likes it better than wearing dresses or skirts, which she has refused 
to do for two years. On a recent evening, Linda Dennis said her daughter was 
old enough to choose her clothing style, but that she would love Natasha to put 
on a blue jean skirt with a ruffle on the bottom and a pink blouse. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly a gagging sound was heard from the other side of the room where 
Natasha was sitting on the rug. She had a finger in her mouth, reacting in mock 
horror to her mother's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like dresses. They're dorky," said Natasha, whose hair is short and 
curly with a wisp of a ponytail in the style of Joe McIntyre of New Kids on the 
Block. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Dennis continued describing the loafers and the long hair with French 
braids she'd like for Natasha. This time a quiet voice said, "Now you're going 
a little too far." 
</P>
<P>
Natasha had left the living room but had partially returned, sticking her head 
in the doorway to protest. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Natasha's practice is paying off. She is one of the best players 
on her team and had allowed only seven goals in her first seven games while her 
team had scored 39. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Linda Dennis was surprised and angered when she heard that 
fathers on a rival team had requested that Natasha prove she was a girl. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had sent me into the bathroom with a mother to look down Natasha's 
pants," she said, "that mother wouldn't have come out. She would have been torn 
up and flushed down the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
After the Lewisville team refused the request for a gender check and won the 
game, 3-1, Linda Dennis walked her daughter across the field to meet her 
purported accuser. 
</P>
<P>
"I approached one of the men and said, 'I'd like you to meet my daughter, 
Natasha,' "Dennis said. "He stopped and took a step back -- like he'd seen a 
ghost -- and said, 'Nice game, boy!' " 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No, it's good game, girl, or good game, kid.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Good game, son,' and reached over and patted her shoulder."

AKJOL WANTS TO RETURN HOME WITH TITLE

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ali Akjol will take a lot with him when he returns home this summer. As an 
exchange student at El Toro High School, Akjol has absorbed American culture: 
the attitudes and styles, including neon T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
In July he will take that knowledge, and the shirts, back to Essen, West 
Germany. But the souvenir Akjol really wants is a letterman's jacket with a 
Southern Section championship patch on it. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, he may get that patch. El Toro plays Cerritos in the 3-A soccer final 
at Gahr High School in Cerritos at 8. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how much he's learned about our culture," El Toro soccer Coach 
Carlos Acre said. "What does a Southern Section patch mean to someone over in 
West Germany? Nothing. But Ali has picked up how much it means to kids here." 
</P>
<P>
When Akjol arrived in September, he expected the United States to be a virtual 
wasteland when it came to soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Akjol, who has played soccer since he was 5, didn't even bring cleats with him; 
the only soccer shorts he had were for show. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out they had soccer at El Toro, I thought I would walk out and be 
a starter," Akjol said. "Then I saw a couple of the players and realized I was 
going to have to work at it. They were a lot better than I thought they would 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Akjol did become a starter, but at first, playing was difficult because of the 
language barrier. Although he understood English, he had trouble communicating. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one time during a game, Ali told us to pass the ball to the other 
team," teammate Greg Schaick said. "But he picked the language up pretty 
quickly. He doesn't like to tell anybody, but Ali is No. 1 in his class in 
Germany. He buys every newspaper every day and spends hours reading them. He's 
very intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
Akjol said soccer helped him learn the English language quicker, in much the 
same way it had helped him learn German. Akjol's parents are from Turkey but 
moved to Germany when his father got a job at an import/export company in 
Essen. 
</P>
<P>
Although Akjol was born in Germany, he spoke mostly Turkish because that's what 
his family and friends spoke. He didn't become fluent in German until after 
playing soccer on a club team. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands a lot more than you realize," Acre said. "I used to talk real 
slow to him, so he could understand. Then one day, a couple of the players 
said, 'Coach, Ali understands every word.' But he's so quiet, you're never 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
Acre, in fact, has only seen Akjol get vocal once. On the bus ride home after 
the Chargers' semifinal victory over Dominguez, the players were discussing 
international soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Al Majia and Jair Gonzalez, whose families are from Colombia, started telling 
everyone that Colombia was going to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, this quiet kid from West Germany became a nationalist," Acre 
said. "There was a lot of flag waving during the bus ride. There were even a 
few kids who said the United States would win a couple games in the World Cup. 
That got some laughs." 
</P>
<P>
Akjol has had a few problems adjusting to the style of soccer. He said the game 
here is a little rougher than it is in Europe, which he attributes to the 
influence of football. 
</P>
<P>
The rules of the game differ somewhat. In one game, Akjol got a yellow card 
because he kicked the ball while the other team was setting up for a direct 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, you don't have to wait for the referee to blow the whistle to kick 
the ball," Acre said. "So, when the kid from the other team touched the ball to 
set it up for the kick, Ali thought it was in play. Ali looked a little 
bewildered." 
</P>
<P>
Akjol is among the team leaders in goals with 11 and also is one of El Toro's 
better passers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how well the other guys have accepted him," Acre said. "You're 
talking about Orange County high school kids who have to make a remark about 
every hair that's out of place. And our team is very cliquish. But Ali is just 
one of the guys. He's even wearing fluorescent shirts now." 
</P>
<P>
After months of learning and interacting, there's only one thing left for 
Akjol. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely want that patch," he said. "It'll give me something to show my 
friends when I get home."

<P>
At halftime of a recent soccer game here for girls under 12, two fathers of 
players on one team walked onto the field. Talking to the referee and the rival

</P>
<P>

affect girls' willingness to compete, undermining decades of growing female 
participation in sports? 
</P>
<P>
Among a pediatrician and a dozen sociologists and psychologists contacted by 
The Times, a few said the incident could affect girls sports negatively. 
</P>
<P>
"If that thinking (of the fathers) prevailed," said Anne Marie Bird, chair of 
the physical education department at Cal State Fullerton, "little girls 
wouldn't go into sports because their femininity would be questioned. I think 
it would be very threatening (to women's sports.)" 
</P>
<P>
But the overwhelming majority viewed the alleged remarks of the Texas fathers 
as an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of incredulity that these men demonstrated borders on irrationality," 
said Don Sabo, a sports sociologist at D'Youville College in Buffalo, N.Y. and 
co-author of a recent book, "Sport, Men and the Gender Order." 
</P>
<P>
"The surveys done during the last decade indicate a tremendous shift in 
attitudes toward girls' participation in athletics," Sabo said. "Overall, 
parents are supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Snyder, a sports psychologist who is programs director of the Women's 
Sports Foundation in New York, said she didn't think the remarks would hurt 
girls' athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the same kind of incident as when (Los Angeles Dodgers general 
manager) Al Campanis made his remarks about blacks," she said. "We look at it 
and say it's outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be vigilant and make sure the opportunities are there for girls, 
but I don't think there is going to be a backlash." 
</P>
<P>
That was good news to Natasha Dennis, 10, the Lewisville Blaze goalie who was 
only 9 when she was apparently asked to prove she was a girl in the Sept. 29 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Next to Dennis' house, a few blocks east of Interstate 35 in Lewisville, is a 
wooden garage with paint chipping from the white siding. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis has appreciably aided the chipping on one wall by frequently lining up 
15 soccer balls on the dirt and kicking them one at a time against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she kicks for hours at night under the bright light extending upward 
from the garage roof. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening two fire trucks lumbered up her block, sirens screaming and 
bright lights flashing, and stopped in front of her house. Neighbors poured out 
of homes on both sides of the street to see what was wrong. Natasha never 
stopped kicking her soccer ball. The trucks had been called for a small stove 
fire in a house across the street. But for Dennis, only the competitive fires 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, who stands 4-feet, 5-inches, has been playing soccer five years. In 
addition to performing on Lewisville Soccer Assn. teams twice a year, she is 
the only girl who plays in boys soccer games at her school during recess. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it when other players come in on me getting ready to kick," said 
Dennis, who wore black soccer shoes with shorts and a T-shirt as she talked to 
a reporter in her living room recently. "I like being able to stop that. I like 
the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think girls can play better than boys if we try our best and practice." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Carpenter, a professor of physical education at Brooklyn College, said 
that the dedication Dennis shows is a hallmark of exceptional athletes -- male 
and female. 
</P>
<P>
"Excellence takes commitment and it takes the same kind whether you're male or 
female," said Carpenter, who attended Dorsey High School in Los Angeles and 
earned her Ph.D. from USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'd have to look pretty far to find an exceptional athlete who grew 
up not putting an extraordinary effort into that part of their life." 
</P>
<P>
Specialists say men are beginning to understand the efforts women make to 
excel, and that their understanding may be reflected in attitudes supporting 
girls athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Sabo and Snyder base their optimism about men's attitudes in large part on a 
1987 telephone study for the Women's Sports Foundation. Researchers contacted 
1,004 parents and 513 of their 7- to 18-year-old daughters. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that "parents show very little concern that sports may be 
unladylike." Ninety-seven percent of the fathers and mothers agreed that sports 
provide important benefits to girls. The idea that sports are equally important 
for boys and girls was generally accepted by 87%. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors, sociologists and psychologists said there was every reason to believe 
that girls 9 and 10 years old could play as well as, if not better than, boys. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Barbara Lippe, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the division of 
endocrinology at the UCLA Medical Center, said that the hormones that change 
boys' strength, such as testosterone, don't appear until puberty, which usually 
starts at 11 1/2 or 12. 
</P>
<P>
At the Women's Sports Foundation, Snyder agreed. "In third- and fourth-grade 
class pictures, girls are the tallest and often the strongest, and its not 
unusual for girls to be better athletes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took a bunch of girls and trained them exactly the same as boys until 
they reached 11 or 12, there's a good chance girls would beat boys." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to possessing abilities similar to boys, many young American girls 
have honed their skills in recent decades by competing in rapidly proliferating 
teams and leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The Women's Sports Foundation study reported that 87% of girls 7 to 10 and 84% 
of girls 11-14 are involved in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder added that 294,000 girls competed in high school sports in 1971, but the 
number increased to 1,839,000 girls along with 3,417,000 boys in 1988-89, the 
last year for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take out 950,000 (boys) playing football, we're getting a lot closer to 
parity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting girls' improvement in gymnastic scores and times for track events, 
Snyder said, "It shouldn't be surprising to anybody . . . that when you begin 
making opportunity available, girls have been improving at all levels of 
competition at a much faster rate than men over the last 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Carole Oglesby, a sports psychologist who chairs the department of physical 
education at Temple University in Philadelphia, says record-setting performers 
or other superb athletes won't be affected by disparaging remarks about their 
femininity. 
</P>
<P>
"If a young woman shows spectacular promise," Oglesby said, "then her parents 
and coaches will pick up on that and see all that collegiate or Olympic 
competition might offer. She's going to stay with it and get all the positive 
support that goes with those activities." 
</P>
<P>
Oglesby, a graduate of Baldwin Park High School and UCLA, said she's concerned 
that the barbs may drive away average performers who will miss the joys and 
lessons of competition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a large group of people in the middle of the normal curve of girls 
who will say if people are going to hassle me about this (femininity), I'm not 
going to stay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the spectacular athlete is the one that men have most trouble accepting, 
Sabo said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think about these two fathers in Texas, I picture them as very 
traditional males who have difficulty accepting a girl's athletic ability in 
non-stereotypical terms," Sabo said. 
</P>
<P>
"When this man sees a woman who can bench-press 220 pounds or run a 5-minute 
mile, or who can kick his butt in volleyball or baseball, he has no category in 
his mind to put that kind of woman. So he has to turn her into a male to deal 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Harris, a sports psychologist and a professor of exercise and sports 
science at Penn State University, said many men think women are inferior 
athletes because those men have confused notions of skill and size or strength. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Steffi Graf, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati . . . who are superb 
tennis players and will be ranked as the best in world, and yet a male ranked 
50th could probably beat a woman ranked No. 1," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The men can have unorthodox strokes and be less skilled, but can compensate 
through strength and quickness. In many cases, women's matches are more 
interesting because there is more strategy." 
</P>
<P>
While Natasha Dennis can boot a soccer ball 40 or 50 yards, the slender goalie 
would hardly be considered powerful. 
</P>
<P>
She plays soccer because she likes it -- better than skateboarding, better than 
jumping on her trampoline and better than playing football with her 
neighborhood friends. 
</P>
<P>
She also likes it better than wearing dresses or skirts, which she has refused 
to do for two years. On a recent evening, Linda Dennis said her daughter was 
old enough to choose her clothing style, but that she would love Natasha to put 
on a blue jean skirt with a ruffle on the bottom and a pink blouse. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly a gagging sound was heard from the other side of the room where 
Natasha was sitting on the rug. She had a finger in her mouth, reacting in mock 
horror to her mother's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like dresses. They're dorky," said Natasha, whose hair is short and 
curly with a wisp of a ponytail in the style of Joe McIntyre of New Kids on the 
Block. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Dennis continued describing the loafers and the long hair with French 
braids she'd like for Natasha. This time a quiet voice said, "Now you're going 
a little too far." 
</P>
<P>
Natasha had left the living room but had partially returned, sticking her head 
in the doorway to protest. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Natasha's practice is paying off. She is one of the best players 
on her team and had allowed only seven goals in her first seven games while her 
team had scored 39. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Linda Dennis was surprised and angered when she heard that 
fathers on a rival team had requested that Natasha prove she was a girl. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had sent me into the bathroom with a mother to look down Natasha's 
pants," she said, "that mother wouldn't have come out. She would have been torn 
up and flushed down the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
After the Lewisville team refused the request for a gender check and won the 
game, 3-1, Linda Dennis walked her daughter across the field to meet her 
purported accuser. 
</P>
<P>
"I approached one of the men and said, 'I'd like you to meet my daughter, 
Natasha,' "Dennis said. "He stopped and took a step back -- like he'd seen a 
ghost -- and said, 'Nice game, boy!' " 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No, it's good game, girl, or good game, kid.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Good game, son,' and reached over and patted her shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
One of Natasha's teammates had trouble understanding the father's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"We're girls, not wimps!" said Nina McIntosh, 9. 
</P>
<P>
Natasha was nonplussed, as if she'd just made an easy save and booted the ball 
50 yards downfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should go somewhere and check and see if they have anything 
between their ears," she said.

  [Text] From April 1994, the Superconducting Sensor Research 
Institute (in Inzai-machi, Inba-gun, Chiba Prefecture; Tsuneo 
Nakahara, Chairman) will begin experimental measurement of very 
weak magnetic fields in the brain, using a direct-current 
superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID) in the 
world's most advanced super high performance magnetic shield 
room. Initially, magnetic fields in the brain and heart will be 
measured with a system that has 64 channels using SQUID and 16 
channels using high-temperature superconduction; the 
interrelationship of this with data from imaging diagnostic and 
other equipment will be studied; and the goal will be to 
complete a 200-channel biological magnetic field measurement 
imaging system. 
  The Superconducting Sensor Research Institute will begin 
experimental measurement of magnetic fields in the brain and 
heart from FY94. With the goal of completing a SQUID clinical 
testing system by the end of March 1994, a metal-base SQUID and 
high-temperature superconducting SQUID system will be introduced 
and a maximum of 20 types of permanent magnet MRIs (magnetic 
resonance imaging diagnostic equipment) will be set up in a 
magnetic shield room that was recently installed in a Tokyo 
Denki University laboratory in Inba-gun, Chiba Prefecture. 
  The external form of the magnetic shield room is a 6-meter 
pseudo-sphere with 32 sides that is made up of a 20-sided 
hexagonal form exactly like a soccer ball and a 12-sided 
pentagonal form. It is made of a total of five layers (four 
permalloy magnetic shield plates developed by NKK Corporation 
and one aluminum shield plate). It is the first in the world to 
succeed in weakening magnetic fields in the external environment 
to less than one-fifteenth. It was decided to go a step further 
to clinical data measurement experiments with the SQUID system. 
  Biodata already is demonstrating a major effect on 
diagnostics now that techniques such as x-ray CT and MRI have 
been put to practical use. The biological magnetic field 
measurement imaging system, by measuring the magnetic fields as 
they exist in the body, will further aid in the estimation of 
the state of activity of nerves and muscles that generate the 
magnetic fields and the diagnoses of minute functional 
abnormalities of the brain or heart. However, magnetic fields 
generated by the body are extremely faint, from .01 to .00000001 
of geomagnetism, so development of a SQUID flux meter for 
measurement as well as environmental adjustment to shut out 
environmental magnetism were essential. 
  Hereafter, the Superconducting Sensor Research Institute 
plans to use the already developed 64-channel metal-based SQUID, 
which operates at the temperature of liquid helium, the 
16-channel high-temperature superconducting SQUID, which works 
at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, and the magnetic shield 
room to discover the interrelationship with clinical data. It 
also plans to work on software development. 
  The Superconducting Sensor Research Institute is an R&amp;D 
company that was formed in March 1990 through investments by the 
Basic Technological Research Promotion Center and 10 private 
firms -- Hitachi, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Yokogawa 
Electric, Shimadzu Corporation, Daikin Industries, Seiko 
Electronics Industries, Takenaka Komuten, Ulvac Corporation, 
Toshiba Corporation, and Shimizu Corporation.

   Princess Anne, daughter of a reigning monarch,
says she wishes her children had better role models.
   ``I look around and wonder what sort of examples they have to
look up to now,'' the daughter of Queen Elizabeth II told a BBC
radio interviewer Wednesday. ``That worries me. I don't think there
are very many ... I think their elder generation is to blame for
that.''
   Anne, 39, who separated from her husband, Capt. Mark Phillips,
in August, said she is not very strict with her 12-year-old son and
8-year-old daughter.
   ``I don't go along with the `seen and not heard.' It would be
very nice but I think it's rather an impractical suggestion
really,'' said the princess.
   She said her travels on behalf of the Save the Children's Fund,
of which she is president, have made her more concerned about what
she sees at home.
   ``You find if you go to any number of countries where the small
rural communities have very strict codes of behavior you don't find
much thieving and pilfering, and murder is almost unheard of,'' the
princess said.

   A man who slipped and fractured his
kneecap at a Rod Stewart concert has sued the Cajundome, Stewart
and his promoters, claiming it was a disabling, permanent injury.
   Charles K. Falterman, 27, filed the lawsuit Tuesday, saying he
was injured April 22 when Stewart began kicking soccer balls into
the audience and the crowd ``reacted almost as an uncontrollable
herd of animals.''
   Falterman said he was near the stage at the time and one soccer
ball came near him. The suit said he slipped on something that had
spilled on the Cajundome floor.

Foreign companies will be able to buy advertising time.
   Westwood One also will produce two other music programs,
``America on Record'' and ``American Musical Classics,'' for
broadcast in the Soviet Union.
   ``American Top 40,'' produced by ABC Radio with host Shadoe

   A 68-year-old mansion in fashionable Highland Park
has been listed for sale by Caroline and Nelson Bunker Hunt, who
emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings earlier this month.
   The asking price on the six-bedroom, six-bath mansion
overlooking Turtle Creek is $2.8 million. The house has marble
fireplaces and a garden room with an Italian tile floor.
   Mrs. Hunt said in a recent interview that her family intends to
move into a smaller home.
   Because of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Hunts were forced to
turn over holdings valued at more than $220 million. Hunt also had
to give up his annual salary of $300,000 and income from widespread
holdings, the Dallas Times Herald said.
   Because Texas law grants homeowners an unlimited exemption for a
homestead in bankruptcy proceedings, the Hunts won't have to give
any proceeds from the sale to creditors.

   Late-night radio talk-show hosts work
strange hours and rarely see prime-time television, says one member
of that select group.
   Mutual Broadcasting System's Jim Bohannon doesn't mind the hours
and doesn't care about the missed television.
   ``They tell me I'm not missing a great deal,'' said Bohannon,
whose day usually begins at 12:45 a.m.
   In addition to subbing on Mutual's ``Larry King Live'' talk show
for the past seven years, Bohannon is host on the ``Jim Bohannon
Show,'' which takes King's slot on Saturday nights. The veteran of
30 years in broadcasting also is host and does feature stories for
Mutual's daily ``America in the Morning'' show.
   Bohannon was in Lincoln Tuesday for the taping of a pilot
segment of a proposed Nebraska Educational Television series in
which high school students discuss political issues. He was the
moderator.

There is no blood left on the soccer field when the Bunnies meet the Lambs. 
</P>
<P>
And there are no winners or losers when the Ducklings take on the Fawns. When 
their game is over, the Kittens and the Puppies don't even know the score, but 
they exchange hugs anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the American Youth Soccer Organization's league for 5-year-old girls 
-- a league whose games are played on what AYSO organizers, with apologies to 
Disneyland, call the "Happiest Field in Mission Viejo." 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is for the kids to have fun," said Paul Beltis, program director for 
the local league. "We don't keep score and we don't have standings. The kids 
have the rest of their lives to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
For the 102 girls in Division 7, the AYSO league is their first experience with 
organized youth sports. At this age, say AYSO coaches, the game is rather 
basic. Run down the field. Kick the ball. Aim for the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"The joy for them is kicking the ball and scoring," said Allan Gallup, 
commissioner of the Mission Viejo AYSO district, which he says is the second 
largest in the nation with more than 3,000 children. "So we don't use goalies." 
</P>
<P>
The girls tend to bunch around the ball like bees around a hive and buzz up and 
down the field, giggling and laughing. League officials like to tell stories 
about untangling the occasional overenthusiastic youngster from the nets when 
their momentum carries them into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, said Gallup, all 22 girls from both teams chased a ball 
beyond the end line and just kept going, ignoring the excited whistles of the 
referee as they ran, en masse, past startled players on the next soccer field, 
then scooted down a hill after the ball, stopping only when it jammed against a 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is so entertaining that parents on the next fields stop watching 
their kids and turn around to watch the girls," Beltis said. 
</P>
<P>
But gradually, they learn the basics of soccer, and in the learning also pick 
up some valuable social skills, their parents say. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially they are very shy," said Lorie Kilgore, as her daughter, Ashley, sat 
quietly by her side after a game last week at Youth Athletic Park in Mission 
Viejo. "Their attention span is very short, and they tend not to be very 
aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
"But then you see them grow and gain confidence in themselves," said Kilgore, 
who coaches the Ponies. "They learn so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Every girl gets a uniform, and at the end of the year, everyone gets a trophy, 
said Peltis, whose daughter Jennifer, the last of his six children -- all girls 
-- is in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"They love it," he said. "It's their very own trophy, and they take it to 
preschool or kindergarten during show and tell and share it with the other 
kids, they're so proud of that trophy." 
</P>
<P>
And by the end of the season, the improvement in play from the early games is 
dramatic, he said. The girls eventually learn the meaning of end lines and how 
to guide the ball instead of kicking it aimlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo is one of only three AYSO districts in the county that separate 
the girls from the boys, Gallup said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even at this age, the boys seem to be more aggressive," he said, which tends 
to send some of the girls into a shell. "As a rule the kids do better when they 
are separate and many (AYSO) districts in the Southern California area are 
trying to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, they don't have the numbers," Gallup said, "which is a shame 
because once they get started, the league really takes off." 
</P>
<P>
Called the "baby animal league" because the teams are named after infants in 
the animal world, the 5-year-olds were divided three years ago into six teams. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 12 teams, and organizers say they are running out of baby 
animal names. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally settled on the Foals and the Fledglings for new names this year," 
Beltis said. "We were going to use Chicks, but we thought some of the parents 
might not be too happy about that." Christine Cotter / Los Angeles Times

DOMINGUEZ HILLS HAS A DYNAMITE DUO IN SOCCER COACH AND HIS STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It could have been a Marine Corps boot camp. It certainly didn't look like the 
kind of workout that Kristi White, the premier women's soccer player at 
second-ranked Cal State Dominguez Hills, would expect before the national 
Division II finals. 
</P>
<P>
But there was the team's leading scorer, under a hazy, hot afternoon sun, 
running in formation with her teammates, circling the Lady Toro practice field 
in preparation for Saturday's national semifinal with fourth-ranked Keene State 
of New Hampshire at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Around and around the team went, the Palos Verdes Peninsula and the oil 
refineries of Carson as backdrops in the distance. At the helm, Coach Marine 
Cano barked instructions. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of the two-hour session, White and her teammates, who wore 
matching black shorts and red T-shirts, never touched a soccer ball. They did 
sprints, they raced and when those were done the women jogged the field, 
stopping only once for water. 
</P>
<P>
"Back to the basics," explained Cano, which is why White, a senior from 
Camarillo, has spent eight seasons under his tutelage, first on a youth state 
select team and for the last four as a Lady Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"Conditioning is a big part of Marine's program," White, a graduate of Rio Mesa 
High School, said. "In high school I lacked conditioning. I thought I could 
become a better athlete if I came here." 
</P>
<P>
White, according to observers, has always had a knack for scoring goals, 
something she calls "the green light." In her career at Dominguez Hills the 
5-foot-4 midfielder has set school records for goals (33), assists (31), total 
points (97) and season assists (16). 
</P>
<P>
A knee injury forced her out of action half of her sophomore year, or those 
totals would be higher. With 17 goals and 50 points this year, she ranks second 
in both of those seasonal categories. 
</P>
<P>
"She's our Magic Johnson. That's for sure," said Cano. 
</P>
<P>
Cano, a former professional goalie, coaches state select girls and women's age 
group teams in the off-season. He recognized White's talent early in her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"I always saw a very good player there," Cano said. "At the time, I thought I 
had a chance to help her develop. It was a little dream that I had that has all 
come together this season. 
</P>
<P>
"She always had the skills, but she was never completely fit and conditioned." 
</P>
<P>
Cano's feisty style and tough conditioning program, plus the chance to go away 
to school but remain fairly close to home, persuaded White to join Cano when 
she chose a college. Dominguez Hills, not known for over-generous scholarship 
offers, allowed Cano to give White a full ride, putting her on similar footing 
with another of the Division II university's "franchise players," basketball 
star Anthony Blackmon. Blackmon, now playing professionally in Japan, went on 
to become the 1989 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Athlete of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Cano expects similar attributes for White, who figures to be named All-American 
no matter how Dominguez Hills fares at the national tournament this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
If White plays the role of the attacking halfback, as she has done all season, 
Dominguez Hills figures to play a major role in the championship tournament, 
which also includes top-ranked and host Barry University and sixth-ranked 
Adelphi University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
"She's our spark plug, a technician, the one that makes us go," Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
White wouldn't go that far. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had the drive to go to the goal," White said. "Most players just 
have skills, but they don't have the drive to go to the goal." 
</P>
<P>
A forward in her youth, White, began playing in Camarillo's American Youth 
Soccer Organization at 8. By the time she was 12, she was playing on a boys 
age-group club team. In her first game with the boys, she anticipated a rebound 
off the crossbar and scored on a header, much to the chagrin of the opposing 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of neat," the diminutive blonde said. 
</P>
<P>
White has been ineffective only twice this season for the Lady Toros (18-2), 
who set school records for most wins and shutouts (15) in a season. Both times 
were games with UC Santa Barbara, a highly ranked Division I team. In fact, the 
Gauchos handed Dominguez Hills its two losses. Santa Barbara just had too many 
quick players shadowing White wherever she went on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"But," said Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, "just think what we could have done 
to Santa Barbara if we had three or four Kristi Whites." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills often builds its teams around skilled players from the South 
Bay, a talent-laden soccer hotbed. By bringing in White, Cano introduced a new 
wrinkle to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have done so well without the rest of the team," White said. "Our 
freshmen helped out a lot. We lost only two seniors from last year's team, so 
we had the base to do well." 
</P>
<P>
White characterizes the Dominguez Hills team as being "physical, (yet) having 
the same finesse of any Division II school." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cano: "It's scary. We still have not reached our potential." 
</P>
<P>
White, however, admits that she is in better condition. She needs to be too. 
Two weeks from now she'll be back in Florida to play in a national tournament 
as a member of a Western women's select team.

AT HOME: CYPRESS: MIDWEST SPIRIT IN ORANGE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES ARE ATTRACTED TO THIS DOWN-HOME COMMUNITY WITH ITS FOLKSY 
NEIGHBORHOODS.

<P>
When the owner of Cypress' only golf course closed the links to make way for a 
167-acre commercial development, citizens rose up in protest and voted down the 
developer's plans in a recent citywide election. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises might not have known what it was getting into 
when it began its wrangle with the down-home Orange County community, described 
by one civic leader as a "spirited tiny town like you might find in the Midwest 
-- and we intend to stay that way." 
</P>
<P>
It's the type of town where children decorate their wagons on the Fourth of 
July and parade around their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
It's a town where longtime resident Joyce Nicholson can't go to the Albertson's 
supermarket without being stopped by a dozen other residents who want to talk 
not only about the price of produce but also the latest town gossip. 
</P>
<P>
"We grew up with Ozzie and Harriet. We wanted that when we grew up. And here we 
have it," said Cheryl Matuz, who moved to town two years ago with her husband, 
Ed, and their twin sons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
T-Ball and Soccer 
</P>
<P>
The Matuz boys are only in kindergarten, but already they're busy several days 
a week on T-ball and soccer teams. Ed Matuz is coach for the baseball team, and 
Cheryl is team mom in the baseball league, which is part of the town's 
extensive recreational system. 
</P>
<P>
So popular is the recreation program that residents from bordering cities often 
use the address of relatives in Cypress to try to get in. 
</P>
<P>
The folksy neighborhoods and ballparks that characterize Cypress were part of a 
master plan for a residential and business community in the 1950s, when cows 
were ordered out and the name Cypress replaced an area that had been known as 
Watertown and Dairy City. 
</P>
<P>
Near the western edge of Orange County, Cypress became a popular settling place 
for middle-income families who wanted bigger homes and yards than they could 
afford in Torrance or Long Beach, where they worked. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress was on its way to becoming a sleepy bedroom community when the Cypress 
Citizens' Assn. formed in the early 1970s to oppose a residential development 
proposed for an area earmarked as part of the city's business park. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to have mixed-use developments or we would simply be a bedroom 
community that would just founder with no tax base," said Nicholson, who led 
the successful fight. "We needed more businesses, but city officials said we 
were in a bad location to attract them." 
</P>
<P>
The business center has since become one of the most successful in Southern 
California and is now the American headquarters for Yamaha Motor, Mitsubishi 
Motor Sales of America and Panasonic Technics, among other Asian firms, and it 
is the corporate headquarters for PacifiCare Health Systems and McDonnell 
Douglas Automation Division. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the citizens' association was revived in the 1980s at the start of 
the Hollywood Park Realty controversy to fight against what the group 
considered too much commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
When Hollywood Park Realty wanted to transform the former public golf course 
surrounding Los Alamitos Race Course in Cypress into a business park and office 
complex, the association fought the development. And in February, voters 
soundly defeated the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The growing number of large companies, attracted to Cypress because of its 
proximity to freeways and to the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, greatly 
enhance the tax base and employ thousands of workers. But most of their workers 
come from other towns, and most Cypress residents drive to jobs outside the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Matuz commutes to Long Beach for a sales job with Douglas Aircraft. The 
Matuz family moved from Hacienda Heights in 1986 because houses were more 
affordable in Cypress than in nearby towns, and the neighborhoods were full of 
young families with children. 
</P>
<P>
"Neighbors watch each other's kids here," said Cheryl Matuz, who works part 
time as a dental hygienist in nearby Los Alamitos. "In Hacienda Heights, 
neighbors didn't know each other. I wouldn't have imagined letting anyone watch 
my kids." 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and Jerry Nicholson moved to Cypress in 1969 from a neighborhood in West 
Garden Grove, also because of their children. 
</P>
<P>
"Although Cypress was small, it had a college, which said something about the 
town and the type of people who wanted to live there," said Jerry Nicholson, 
who is a schoolteacher at North High School in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"On a practical level, if the kids didn't want to go to a university, Cypress 
College was an option," Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
While the town can be ideal for young, middle-class families, its neighborhoods 
also can be homogeneous, with very few homes displaying either poverty or great 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a middle market," said Joyce Nicholson, who also works as a real estate 
agent. "If you want to move up, you typically have had to to move out. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few New Homes 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said the most expensive homes sell for about $425,000. Most 
characteristic is the three-bedroom starter home, which Nicholson said sells 
for about $210,000, compared to a little less than $180,000 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson and her husband said that with their children now grown, they may 
soon be looking for a newly built home, also a rarity in Cypress, where most 
homes are now more than five years old. 
</P>
<P>
The former "Texaco tank farm," the site of crude oil tanks for years, is now 
being developed by Cypress Homes Inc., with 670 homes planned, the first 
expected to open in the fall of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Hollywood Park Realty land, the tank farm is the last area to be 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
To stay in their home as their tastes get more expensive, the Matuz family is 
now in the middle of a major remodeling that has meant ripping out carpets and 
sanding the hardwood underneath. 
</P>
<P>
A new family room has been added to the four-bedroom, two-fireplace home, and 
other additions include French doors and windows, a potbellied stove and a 
Colonial mantel. 
</P>
<P>
Although Joyce Nicholson characterizes the style of Cypress as Midwestern, it 
lacks some attractions of towns in the Heartland. There is no downtown, and 
there is not even a regional shopping mall, nor is either planned. 
</P>
<P>
And with the city's master plan nearly complete, the last major issue for the 
city's growth will be the settlement of the Hollywood Park property, which now 
has an uncertain future, said Darrell Essex, city manager of Cypress since 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
On Nicholson's wish list for part of the land is a civic theater complex, which 
might be home to the Cypress Civic Theatre group and a new pops orchestra that 
has recently formed. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, residents said it's likely that Jerry Nicholson and others 
will have to go to another town if they want to play golf.

<TEXT>
   The two Koreas met on the soccer field
at Olympic Stadium today before more than 80,000 South Koreans, who
cheered for both teams and roared approval for unification.
   South Korea's national team won 1-0, but the score was
insignificant beside the diplomatic coup in having two enemy
nations share a playing field for only the second time since World
War II.
   The first time was two weeks ago in North Korea, when the
northern team beat the south 2-1.
   Today's crowd was the largest to see a South Korean sports event
since the 1988 Olympic Games.
   At the end of the game, spectators rose for a standing ovation
as the athletes jogged around the stadium holding hands and waving.
The teams exchanged shirts and waved them in the air.
   ``Our wish is unification,'' blared a unification song over the
loudspeakers.
   The game, called North-South Unification Soccer, is the high
point of a five-day visit by a 78-member North Korean sports
delegation, the first from the Communist north to visit the south
since the 1945 division of the peninsula.
   South Korean soccer players visited the north earlier this
month. That visit was only the second civilian exchange between the
countries in more than four decades.
   The soccer delegation returns to North Korea on Friday after
rounds of sightseeing, dinners and talks on future sports
exchanges.
   South Korean Sports Minister Chung Dong Sung and his North
Korean counterpart, Kim Yu Sun, agreed in principle to form a joint
single team for the 1992 Olympic Games and other international
sports events at talks in Pyongyang. They said further discussions
would be held in Seoul.
   About 5,000 plainclothes police were positioned inside and
outside the stadium. Spectators were searched twice and passed
through metal detectors to get to their seats. Scalpers were asking
$140 for tickets, 10 times the highest face value price.
   The teams of the rival Koreas entered the stadium side by side,
holding hands and waving to thunderous applause.
   ``This is not purely sports festival,'' Kim said before the
match began. ``It should lead to a unification festival.''
   ``I hope this soccer match will be a spring board for national
unification,'' Chung.
   Thousands roared in approval and waved colorful pompons.
Spectators had been asked not to bring national flags, decorative
placards or other paraphernalia which would be identified only with
South Korea.
   A drum and bugle corps played and a gigantic electric signboard
flashed the pictures of the ministers. The North Korean team threw
half a dozen soccer balls signed with their signatures into the
grandstand and screaming spectators raced to retrieve them.
   During the game, the South Korean crowd cheered wildly for plays
by both teams. Radical students, who had said they would root for
the North Korean visitors, were not visible.
   News reports said tickets were sold on an individual basis
apparently to avoid large radical or dissident groups sitting
together.
   The sports exchange comes at a time when South Korea and North
Korea are seeking to find ways to ease tensions and work together
for unification.
   The prime ministers of both Koreas met for the second time last
week in Pyongyang, the north's capital, and have agreed to meet
again in Seoul in December. A South Korean musicians' delegation
returns Wednesday from a 10-day visit to the north.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and
capitalist South in 1945 at the end of the World War II. The two
nations fought a war in the early 1950s and a peace treaty was
never signed.
   The border between the Koreas remains tightly sealed and is one
of the most heavily fortified demarcations in the world with more
than 1.5 million troops on either side.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: Studs - London Fringe Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All soccer is drama, but no play is a soccer match. English player Paul
Gascoigne made a plausible 'Phantom of the Opera' with the protective face
mask he wore during Lazio's 5-0 defeat of Ancona; there was a standing
ovation for him. One nil to soccer. But now with Studs at the Tricycle
Theatre, the Irish company Passion Machine puts the soccer back into drama.
It makes unusual viewing. Studs presents eleven players on stage in a high
energy - if overlong - soccer play. The locker-room dialogue is brawling and
chaotic, but the on-pitch movement around the small Tricycle stage makes a
study in agility and precision.
The play tells of Emmet Rovers, a team so incompetent that its left wing,
who never gets the ball, advertises for a manager. One candidate applies. He
appears to have a footballing past. He licks the Rovers into shape, they
topple the cup holders and breeze through to the final . . . which they
lose. The manager turns out to be an alcoholic with the same name as the
great footballer the Rovers took him for; and now a developer has started to
build on their home pitch.
The transformation of no-hopers into champs is a film and theatre staple:
Studs does for soccer what Pygmalion does for elocution and Stepping Out for
dancing. Nor is a play about soccer, alongside An Evening With Gary Lineker
or The Boy's Own Story, an original idea.
Paul Mercier's writing and direction runs the action on a kind of
high-octane essence of locker-room: swearing, chanting, weeping, shouting
and laughing. The strength of this play lies in the choreographed direction
of the match scenes. Here, each player is spotlighted with the ball, and
delivers a monologue of his thoughts as he tears down the pitch, while the
other players provide the rest of the game's noise and tension.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After weeks of shipping tanks and other tools
of war to the Persian Gulf area, the Pentagon is now looking for a
few lighter items to supply the troops.
   Things like squirt guns, nerf balls, macrame and kite-making
kits.
   The Pentagon on Tuesday invited the public to donate a variety
of recreational items to the troops in the desert and in the
Persian Gulf. It also cautioned that reading materials should not
include pictures of scantily clad women.
   Among other desired items: electronic and board games such as
Nintendo and Trivial Pursuit; music and video tapes as well as Arab

FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Mr Atlantic helps fans get into the groove -
Ahmet Ertegun says Major League Soccer will succeed in the US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
On the shelves behind Ahmet Ertegun's desk sit dozens of framed photographs
of the sort you might expect to see in the Manhattan office of Atlantic
Records' co-founder and chairman. There is a picture of Ertegun with Quincy
Jones, the legendary record producer, and one of Ertegun arm-in-arm with
Mick Jagger.
Yet on the top shelf is a prominently displayed picture that has no
connection with the worlds of rhythm and blues, jazz and soul in which
Ertegun has spent most of his working life.
It is a photograph of Ertegun holding a cumbersome gold statuette instantly
recognisable as the centrepiece of international sport's crown jewels - the
World Cup trophy. In the picture, Ertegun is sporting the awed, slightly
sheepish grin that any soccer fan might wear in the circumstances. But
Ertegun is no ordinary soccer fan. He is a member of the World Cup 1994
organising committee.
Ertegun, who is 70, earned his place on the committee for his efforts over
the past 25 years in helping the roots of soccer grow in a seemingly
infertile land. During the early 1970s, he and his late brother Nesuhi
persuaded Warner Communications to provide the financial backing for a New
York team - the Cosmos - to play in the North American Soccer League.
For a few glorious years, the Erteguns, with the help of Pele, Franz
Beckenbauer and other soccer greats, put the Cosmos and the NASL on to the
American sports map, where it stayed until excessive spending and
insufficient revenues plunged the league into bankruptcy and failure a
decade ago.
In spite of the unhappy ending, Ertegun remembers the days of the Cosmos
fondly. He recounts a story about Beckenbauer's astonishment at finding
himself dribbling the ball towards goal in his Cosmos debut while an
announcer carefully explained the rules of the game to the crowd over the
loudspeaker.
But Ertegun is too busy enjoying this World Cup to dwell on the past. As
someone who was always confident that the tournament would be a success, he
is especially delighted with the large numbers of Americans who have
attended the games. He says the television pictures which have shown
stadiums filled with colourful, partisan fans following their national teams
have not told the full story.
'It always looks as if there are more foreigners than Americans, but there
aren't. The foreigners are very visible, and very audible. You know: 'Ooh,
aah, Paul McGrath. Ooh, aah, Paul McGrath.' Right? You hear that.'
Yet, he says, referring to a popular US player, 'there's no 'Ooh, aah, Alexi
Lalas. Ooh, aah, Alexi Lalas'.' Ertegun's point is that traditional soccer
countries may not know it, but Americans have embraced the World Cup
wholeheartedly - but not noisily.
'Soccer in America is a family sport,' he says. 'In Europe men go to see
soccer, and they sometimes take their sons, if they're old enough. Here the
whole family goes. They have picnics in the parking lot. The Americans view
it as a nice day out.'
But can a top-level US professional soccer league be founded on the
enthusiasm of fans who view the game as a nice day out? Fifa awarded the
World Cup to the US in the hope that the interest generated would provide
the basis for a fully-fledged soccer league, one that would last longer than
the ill-fated NASL.
Ertegun is realistic about whether the World Cup legacy will sustain Major
League Soccer, the new league planned for next year. But, he says, 'I'm not
sure that a game between Tulsa and Buffalo will attract many viewers. We've
got to build again from the ground up.'
He believes the best American players should be allowed to play abroad,
because it is only in the big European leagues that they can earn the kind
of money which will start enticing young athletes away from mainstream
American sports and into soccer.
'If some of our players playing abroad start to make a million bucks a year,
we may see a lot of kids from the inner city hone their talents.
'Maybe we'll have some of those young men who can run 100m in under 10
seconds learn how to do the same with a ball between their feet. When that
happens, we could have the world's greatest team.'

CSUN DAY CAMP TURNS YOUNG INTO STUDENTS OF FITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, Gray is a Van Nuys free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Wade is less than 5 feet tall, yet he's preparing for a place as point 
guard on an NBA basketball team. That may not be impossible. Eric is 10 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the last four summers, he has spent a month of mornings at Cal State 
Northridge's Summer Youth Fitness and Sports Camp, a 25-year-old nonprofit, 
coeducational program for 7- to 12-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
The camp isn't designed to turn youngsters into superstars but to provide a 
non-competitive learning environment, said William J. Vincent, director of the 
camp and a CSUN faculty member. Every day, the children rotate through four 
classes on the campus: swimming, which ranges from basic instruction for 
non-swimmers to diving and water safety; gymnastics; games such as 
shuffleboard, jump rope, handball and kick ball; and sports, including 
</P>
<P>
volleyball, basketball and soccer. Badminton, tennis and golf are taught the 
older children. 
</P>
<P>
Staffed by CSUN's Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education faculty and 
community teachers, the camp is committed to teaching those with perceptual 
motor problems or medical disabilities as well as those who already excel in 
sports, Vincent said. Students are recruited through flyers and brochures sent 
to local schools. 
</P>
<P>
The staff focuses on the "total person concept: helping the students learn 
cooperation and social skills and building self-esteem and self-image," Vincent 
said. As soon as children start doing well on the playground -- having the 
motor coordination, strength and skill to play typical games and sports -- they 
feel more self-confident and make friends more easily, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Cratty, program director of the Center for the Improvement of Physical 
Coordination in West Los Angeles and professor of kinesiology at UCLA, said 
there are three types of self-esteem in children: social, intellectual and 
physical ability. 
</P>
<P>
He said studies show that by increasing a child's physical ability, his 
intellectual self-esteem can rise too. Gifted children and those with learning 
disabilities are often what he terms awkward, and the tack to take is to do 
what you can to help them improve their coordination and skill on the 
playground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The CSUN program provides basic assessment as well as coordination and skill 
training, Vincent said. It offers posture analysis with a written evaluation to 
parents, a screening system for such divergences as scoliosis (lateral 
curvature of the spine), knock knee (when the child stands with the knees 
together and the ankles do not meet) and bowlegs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Fitness Test 
</P>
<P>
The camp also administers a national fitness test that checks for 
cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, overall endurance and body fat 
percentage. The results are computer-generated and recorded, and returning 
students can compare their past records each year. Both tests are valuable 
because they are not usually offered in public or private schools, Vincent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most students who attend the camp are from nearby because there is no 
transportation available through the program. At least 50% of the 200 students 
have been in previous years, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Denise Austin, a consultant to the President's Council on Physical 
Education and Sports, a council survey showed that "90% of all children ages 6 
to 12 fail the presidential sports tests. And 90% can't do one chin-up. Only 
one-sixth of all boys who take the test can do 40 sit-ups in one minute, and a 
study in 'The Physician and Sports Medicine Journal' estimated that 15% to 25% 
of U.S. schoolchildren are obese." 
</P>
<P>
Austin said the decrease in physical ability has taken place just since 1974, 
when more rigorous physical education routines were still budgeted in most of 
the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James G. Garrick, an orthopedic surgeon and director of the Center for 
Sports Medicine at St. Francis Memorial Hospital, San Francisco, said, "The 
fitness levels of children and adolescents have been declining for over two 
decades." 
</P>
<P>
The decreased availability of education dollars makes changing physical 
education programs in the schools an unrealistic goal, Garrick said. He favors 
"an enhancement of extra-scholastic youth sports programs and increased 
education and pressure from parents and the medical profession." 
</P>
<P>
As for participants in the CSUN program, Merrill Hardy, professor of physical 
education at CSUN and the swimming teacher at the Youth Fitness and Sports 
Camp, said they are a fairly homogeneous group, but "a lot of parents have 
their kids in the program because they are less fit, less coordinated than 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy does not think that the decrease in children's fitness levels would come 
as a surprise to anyone. Television, videotapes and games have turned them into 
couch potatoes, and physical education has become increasingly a part-time 
elective at most junior and senior high schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Develop Basic Skills 
</P>
<P>
The key in extracurricular programs such as CSUN's is to develop basic movement 
skills in children so they can succeed and truly enjoy athletics and sports, 
beginning at as early an age as possible, Hardy said. "Kids who don't move 
successfully don't tend to exercise," he said. The CSUN camp started, in fact, 
as a demonstration school for elementary school education, an attempt to show 
CSUN students and the community an ideal approach to teaching fitness. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy suggests that "parents look for programs that offer these kinds of 
opportunities for kids, such as the Department of Parks and Recreation programs 
-- at local parks -- and the YMCA." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent warns against signing children up for such sports as T-Ball and soccer 
too quickly. Not only may parents be limiting the range of choices a child may 
make regarding his favorite activities, but the competitive, organized sports 
tend to attract the cream of the crop. Youngsters with motor weakness or the 
need for skill training may be left on the bench, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy recommends that parents limit television to a specific hour of the day, 
and that they suggest or require 30 minutes a day of physical activity. 
"Parents are short-changing their kids if they don't help them find one to two 
things they will really enjoy doing athletically, to have the opportunity to 
succeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing their parents enjoying an activity does more than anything to get kids 
interested in fitness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The camp costs $260 for a one-month session of half-day classes held five 
mornings a week. There is one teacher for every 12 children at the session, 
which is in July. For information about next year's enrollment, call (818) 
885-2661.

AUSTRIAN CREATES GAME COMBINING SOCCER AND TENNIS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
And now for the latest spesoc scores: Austria 3, the United States 2. 
</P>
<P>
Spesoc? Of course. 
</P>
<P>
It's a combination of soccer and tennis created by a former Austrian soccer 
league player to get round the lack of players at the school where he once 
coached. 
</P>
<P>
"Spesoc or Special Soccer is a game for the world," Wolfgang Anderl said in an 
interview. "You need only two things: goalie ability and a good leg to score." 
</P>
<P>
"People like to watch direct duels between players like in tennis. And I'm sure 
that many, including prominent athletes, like to play soccer in singles or 
doubles." 
</P>
<P>
Dreaming of the future, Anderl has already designed a 20,000-seat arena, 
devised a full set of rules and even laid the groundwork for a WSA -- World 
Spesoc Association -- governing body. 
</P>
<P>
Such grandiose plans seemed far removed from the chilly field where Austria 
recently downed a U.S. team in a Saturday afternoon game watched by just a few 
dozen spectators. 
</P>
<P>
As in conventional soccer, the object was to score goals with kicks. Only the 
goalie could handle the ball. 
</P>
<P>
But each team had only two or three players. The 100-foot by 100-foot field was 
divided into two halves, each containing zones for defense, attack and free 
play. 
</P>
<P>
In the attack zone, players could touch the ball only twice before taking a 
shot on goal. Only in the free zone could the ball be kicked around and 
dribbled as in conventional soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Like tennis, spesoc has no time limit. Games are over the best of five sets, 
each set lasting until one team scores six goals. Where games are tied at two 
sets all, teams have the option of playing a penalty shootout or a fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting game, particularly in a city where there is the problem of 
space. You can play it anywhere," enthused David Hagan, a sports professor at 
the American School in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan, who used to play with English third division club Aldershot, coached the 
U.S team which battled Anderl's Austrians. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is to create a grassroots basis and find people to play it," 
admitted the coach, whose American squad consisted of a Yugoslav, a Turk, an 
Austrian, a Dane and a Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"Spesoc is more goal oriented and it has more action than classical soccer but, 
on the minus side, it takes dribbling and technical combinations out of the 
game. It's all shoot," Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans won the first two sets 6-4, 6-4. But then Anderl brought another 
twist of Spesoc into play. 
</P>
<P>
He resorted to a "risk play," pitting just one Austrian against two opponents. 
In that situations, the lone player scores two sets by winning only one. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Sir, 17, booted in six goals for Austria against just one for the 
visitors to tie the scores at 2-sets all. Austria then proved superior in the 
decisive penalty shootout. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic cheers from the small pro-Austria crowd were scarcely matched on 
the field, however. 
</P>
<P>
"As a variation it's good. But we like more the big soccer," said Makoto 
Niiyama from Kagoshima, Japan, the U.S. goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Anderl still hopes to export the game to the United States, home to 
1994 World Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vienna there is less and less interest for soccer in general," he lamented. 
"In America the atmosphere is better."

   Scientists Make Quantities

   LONDON -- A team of West German and American scientists
has produced large quantities of a new form of carbon that
may occur naturally in space and could find important uses as
an industrial lubricant on earth.
   The new substance is dubbed "fullerite," after the late
architect and engineer R. Buckminster Fuller. Like his
geodesic domes, each molecule of the material is shaped like
a soccer ball.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Exact uses of the material won't be known for months, as
all its properties aren't yet known. But it's likely to join
a growing list of exotic, man-made materials finding uses in
engineering, aerospace and other fields.
   One possible application is as an industrial lubricant,
according to Alan Mackay, a crystallographer at London's
Birkbeck College, where Mr. Fuller once worked. In its
powdered graphite form, carbon is already used to reduce
grinding and wear in some high-precision machinery.
   The hollow ball-shaped molecules may also find uses in
chemistry, as submicroscopic capsules containing the
ingredients for chemical reactions.
   Very limited quantities of the unusual, 60-atom carbon
molecules were first produced in 1985 by researchers at the
University of Sussex. But the latest advance, reported in
today's issue of Nature, a British scientific journal, brings
the substance closer to commercial application.

<LEADPARA>  A preliminary autopsy Wednesday left doctors with few clues about what killed
Russell Edwards other than a bad heart, bad luck -- or both.;    A
million-to-one accident so rare, doctors said, that they would be hesitant to
even warn parents about keeping their kids from roughhouse games like "Cuss
Words." The thump to 15-year-old Russell's chest was not strong enough to
leave a bruise.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Doctors can't even prove it was the thump that made his heart stop. Perhaps
just an awful coincidence, said Charlie Young, a cardiologist at Kaiser-Santa
Teresa hospital, where Russell was taken.;    But such improbable deaths
happen. Medical literature includes reports of people whose hearts stopped
after being hit by soccer balls, even a whiffle ball. Such an event is
"exceedingly rare," said Kaiser cardiologist Larry Lawrence. In a quick survey
of colleagues, none recalled a similar case.;    The blow may have acted as a
trigger, Young said, and set off a condition that predisposed Russell's heart
to irregular muscle contractions. But the autopsy found no obvious heart
deformities. That leaves the possibility of microscopic defects in the heart
muscles, viral infection or an electrical abnormality.;    But even a full
autopsy -- to be completed in about six weeks -- won't detect an electrical
defect. A thorough examination when Russell was alive might not have
discovered a heart in danger, either, Young said.;    "We're all left
wondering what happened," said Robert Crane, the emergency room doctor who
tried to save him. "There's no good answer."  </TEXT>

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP '90; 
</P>
<P>
IT WILL GET WORSE FOR U.S.

FLORENCE, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took only one game to confirm what many of us already knew: 
</P>
<P>
That the United States is more prepared to play host to a World Cup than to 
play in one. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side will qualify automatically in 1994, when the tournament comes to 
California and Florida and points in between. And that's a lucky break, because 
for the time being, the U.S side might be good enough to lick Guatemala or El 
Salvador or the lovely and talented Trinidad and Tobago, but beyond that, 
they've got two left feet. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the news was hardly all bad for the United States in Sunday's 5-1 World 
Cup loss to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
At least nobody was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Tony Meola did crash face-first into a goal post. Forward and 
serious scoring threat Peter Vermes did go down wailing with an injured hip. 
And midfielder Eric Wynalda did have somebody step on his toe, whereupon he 
gave the Czech a body-check and promptly was excused from playing the rest of 
the game, making Wynalda either the most foolish or most fortunate man on the 
American team. 
</P>
<P>
"We got stomped," U.S. defender Desmond Armstrong said. "But hey, it comes with 
the territory. We're here with the big boys now." 
</P>
<P>
Said teammate Michael Windischmann: "Around the world, people think we can't 
play soccer. And when the score's 5-1, you understand why people think that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Now we know how it feels to be one of those countries like Egypt or Uruguay 
that draws the United States as a first-round opponent in Olympic basketball. 
The Americans went into this World Cup being told that they didn't stand a 
chance . . . and guess what? They didn't stand a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's not even one of the good teams. The Czechs are slow. Just wait 
until the United States has to play Italy Thursday at Rome. A calf stands a 
better chance to win a rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't going to get any easier," Paul Caligiuri said. 
</P>
<P>
It is Caligiuri whom we have to thank -- or blame -- for being here. UCLA's 
contribution to the U.S. cause is the one whose goal in Trinidad put the United 
States into the World Cup for the first time in 40 years. And Caligiuri's thing 
of beauty early in Sunday's second half gave the United States its first World 
Cup goal in 40 years -- another gem for the kid from Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the team sputtered and stalled like a broken-down Alfa Romeo. 
</P>
<P>
You would never know that you were watching the youngest and physically 
lightest specimens in the tournament. Time after time, the Americans were a 
step behind. When they went heads-up for a ball, the Czechs were always several 
inches higher. Some U.S. players, Caligiuri included, even mentioned "fatigue" 
as a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Fatigue? For a team with an average age of 24? 
</P>
<P>
The Americans also come billed as the most-educated team in the field, each of 
them having attended college. It was proved Sunday that this does not 
necessarily make them the brains of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda, the former San Diego State player from Westlake Village who turned 21 
on Saturday, used his head on the soccer ball better than he did when he 
flattened Czechoslovakia's Jozef Chovanec, who evidently had stomped on 
Wynalda's foot. For striking back in anger, Wynalda drew a red card from an 
official, suffered the indignity of being thrown out of his first World Cup 
game, and becomes ineligible for the next game as well. 
</P>
<P>
Not his greatest move, as even teammates agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any time you get a red card, it's stupid," Windischmann said. 
"Wynalda, he's younger. He has to learn. You have to wait until later to 
retaliate if you feel you must. To outright push somebody, right in front of a 
linesman, I think it's dumb, and it doesn't help us, and now he doesn't get to 
play the next game. It's just dumb." 
</P>
<P>
It began as such a lovely day, too. American flags spangled the Communale 
Stadium grandstand. Backup goalkeeper David Vanole led the U.S. procession onto 
the field with a tiny flag protruding from the top of his cap. And starting 
goalie Tony Meola spent the first 27 minutes stopping everything that came his 
way. 
</P>
<P>
After that, it turned brutto. Ugly. The Czechs averaged a goal every 10 1/2 
minutes. They had several near-goals, too. Meola flopped around like a seal. He 
actually played pretty well. He just needed three or four more arms. 
</P>
<P>
It hurt, too. "It's my dream to play professionally in Europe someday, and this 
put a big dent in it," Meola said. "It's tough to think how this must have 
looked. I mean, 5-1! That's bad, man." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing in the World Cup, and I wouldn't trade my spot with anybody," 
midfielder Tab Ramos said. "But it's difficult to swallow and forget when 
you've never taken a loss as bad as this." 
</P>
<P>
And the Italian side awaits. 
</P>
<P>
"And Italy," as Armstrong said, "is scary." 
</P>
<P>
Especially when you belong to a team that loses by four, and the sport isn't 
basketball.

TRIP TO HUNGARY REMINDS SOCCER COACH OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is so crowded for the annual Spring Festival that residents approach 
weary-looking tourists to inquire whether they need rooms in their homes for 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Even spring has come to Budapest, although it is not likely to stay much longer 
than the tourists. Pretty girls in miniskirts walk arm in arm with their proud 
beaus; young couples, pushing babies in strollers, and joggers unselfishly make 
room for one another on the promenade alongside the Danube. 
</P>
<P>
"As I'm sitting here, along with the river, some thoughts are floating by," Bob 
Gansler says as he watches life's parade from a park bench. 
</P>
<P>
He is a Hungarian of German descent, but the story he tells over the next hour 
as he sits under the blue sky next to the not-so-blue Danube is one of 
post-World War II America. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler was born a few miles west of this river almost 49 years ago, near the 
Yugoslavia border in the small farming village of Mucsi. 
</P>
<P>
The village was Hungarian according to the map but German in every other way, 
including heritage, traditions and language. When he was 5 years old, his 
family moved to West Germany, remaining there for six years before emigrating 
to a city on the other side of the Atlantic with a large German population -- 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
He has returned to Budapest as coach of the U.S. soccer team, which plays 
Hungary tonight. The last time he was here was in 1979, when he was the 
assistant coach for a U.S. team that scored a stunning 2-0 victory over 
Hungary, traditionally among the best teams in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed since then as Hungary and its Eastern Bloc neighbors race 
toward democracy. In the square where only 34 years ago Russian tanks 
discouraged a revolution, campaign posters advertise next Sunday's free 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a graphic photo display of the bloody uprising in Beijing's Tian 
An Men Square, a hardly subtle reminder that it is better for the people, 
rather than the People's Army, to control a country's destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Attracting more attention, a Hungarian rock band plays '60s music. The vocalist 
speaks no English, but he can sing it, mimicking Chuck Berry and the Beatles in 
appropriately accented American or British. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, operator," he wails, "get me Memphis, Tennessee." 
</P>
<P>
By the river, it is quiet. Politics, borders, trends and even people change. 
The Danube is constant. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some small recollections of the town I was born in, my interaction with 
my grandfather. Not my father; he was off to war," Gansler says. "You wonder 
what might have been had you stayed here." 
</P>
<P>
The Ganslers and the Bittners, his mother's family, were among the thousands of 
Germans who came to this country in the mid-18th Century at the invitation of 
Maria Theresa, the empress of the Holy Roman Empire, the queen of Hungary and 
Bohemia, and the archduchess of Austria. Hoping to repopulate her empire after 
a series of costly wars with the Turks, she offered homesteads. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community of about 3,000 or 3,500 people was entirely German," Gansler 
says. "The school, the church, the businesses were all German. We even called 
our mayor by the German title, burghermeister." 
</P>
<P>
As a young boy, Gansler did not know his father, a soldier in the Hungarian 
army who fought on the side of the Nazis in World War II. He was captured on 
the Eastern front by the Russians and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. 
</P>
<P>
The most influential man in Gansler's life was his maternal grandfather, 
Janczi, who before the war provided for the family by periodically traveling 
across Western Europe to the Netherlands and stowing away on a freighter headed 
for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
His destination invariably was Milwaukee, which at the time was nearly as much 
German as American. Without speaking a word of English, he was able to work for 
the railroad as a repairman or night watchman until he had enough money to send 
home so his wife could buy another acre of farm land. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of World War II, the Ganslers and Bittners were relatively 
prosperous. But that changed in 1946, when the triumphant Russians forced all 
Germans, even those whose families had not lived in Germany for more than two 
centuries, out of Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'Take whatever you can take on your back,' and put us on the 
nearest freight train to Germany," Gansler says. "It was no Holocaust, but we 
lost everything we had. It was part of the punishment for being German. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything at that point was absolute chaos. It took us two weeks to make a 
trip that should have taken eight hours. Whenever the Russians needed an 
engine, they took the one off our train and brought it back a couple of days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"I was only 5, but I remember playing under the train. The mothers would come 
screaming in panic when the engine was being hooked up again. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather told me about men making visits to the woods and having to 
chase the train in their underwear when they heard it leaving again. I don't 
know about that. He was a story teller. He liked to embellish things." 
</P>
<P>
Not long after the refugees arrived in Ruckingen, West Germany, near Frankfurt, 
Gansler's father was released from the prison camp and, through the Red Cross, 
reunited with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler was introduced to soccer as a schoolboy in Germany, developing a 
lifelong infatuation with the sport that enabled him to become the first coach 
in 40 years to take the United States to the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
What might have been had he stayed in Mucsi? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing pertaining to soccer, he supposes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the kind of village where nobody had time for athletics," he says. "You 
worked and you worked, you slept, and you worked again. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents went four years full time to school, and, for an additional two 
years, they went two days a week. By the time you were 10 or 12, you were out 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Soccer didn't come up until I started going to school in Germany. At every 
recess, every day after school, there was a soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
"It always took me half an hour longer to get to school in the morning and half 
an hour longer to get home in the afternoon because I was kicking something 
along the way -- rocks, tin cans, whatever else. It's like inner city kids are 
in the U.S. with a basketball. That's the way I grew up." 
</P>
<P>
The problem with all that kicking was that in postwar Germany hardly anyone had 
more than one pair of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather tried to convince me to play soccer barefooted," Gansler says. 
"He said, 'If you get a hole in your foot, God will take care of it. If you get 
a hole in your shoes, it'll cost me money." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler has fond memories of Germany but it was not home for his family. 
</P>
<P>
"In Hungary, we were the Germans," he says. "In Germany, we were the 
Hungarians. Basically, we were displaced persons." 
</P>
<P>
The International Catholic Welfare Organization came to their rescue, offering 
families free one-way trips to the United States, Canada or Australia. 
Gansler's father, Adam, chose the United States, settling in Milwaukee because 
of the contacts Janczi Bittner had made there, and became a bricklayer. 
</P>
<P>
There were no youth soccer leagues, but Gansler soon was introduced to the 
mysteries of baseball. Because he had a strong arm, he was dispatched to center 
field. But his first experience with a fly ball ended in embarrassment when he 
allowed it to drop in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
"I treated it like a soccer ball," he says. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he finished high school, he had the game figured out to the extent 
that was he was offered a rookie league contract as a catcher by the Milwaukee 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not very bright, but I looked at Class D, C, B, AA and AAA and decided I'd 
better go to college," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But while attending Marquette University, he continued to play soccer for one 
of the nation's best amateur teams, the Milwaukee Bavarians. 
</P>
<P>
"The key reason I stayed with the sport was because the Bavarian Soccer Club 
was more than just a place to play the game," he says. "It was an extended 
family sort of thing. Germans are very club-oriented. The friends I made there 
then are my friends now. 
</P>
<P>
"Every first Friday of the month when I'm home, we have a sing-along. We 
pretend we still know the old songs. No, that's wrong. We do know the old 
songs. We pretend we can sing them." 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife and four children belong to one other club in Milwaukee, made 
up of natives of Mucsi and their descendants. 
</P>
<P>
"Seventy-five percent of that little village is now in Milwaukee," he says. 
"After being spread all over the world, they just found each other."

MELVIN DURSLAG: U.S. GETS NO KICK FROM SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Performing in soccer the other night amid the historic splendor of the Los 
Angeles Coliseum, whose preservation exceeds in importance that of any of the 
great pyramids, the Soviet Union and Colombia drew only 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, one was dealing here with box office nations, appearing in the news 
almost as much as the Trumps. 
</P>
<P>
And now, as before, one inspecting attendance was led to ask oneself that 
question of vital sociological concern -- why won't U.S. spectators go for 
soccer? 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is an excellent game, appreciated by viewers the planet over. If 
something exists that may be called the true international sport, it would be 
soccer. Its World Cup enjoys status of an athletic classic. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the effort of soccer to establish a beachhead in the United 
States, whatever arguments made in the game's behalf, soccer has lost its 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
And, professionally today, the sport here is reduced to an endeavor labeled 
indoor soccer, performed under a roof on a short field flanked by plexiglass 
boards, off which the ball can be played on the carom, as in jai alai. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas standard soccer features 11 to a side, indoor calls for six. And if you 
wonder idly what an indoor participant looks like, be assured he comes with one 
head, two arms, two legs and the usual number of fingers and toes. 
</P>
<P>
The indoor league, once comprising 12 teams, is down to eight, struggling to 
keep its pulse in the tradition of any form of pro soccer in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced in 1967 that outdoor soccer stood on the doorsill of greatness in 
North America, promoters put together two leagues, consisting of 22 teams. Such 
confidence was vested in the sport that the rival leagues, amazingly, 
overlapped in five cities. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, for instance, was the home of the Toros and the Zorros, the latter 
owned by Jack Kent Cooke, who exclaimed rapturously: "What a marvelous game! Do 
you realize you can outfit a whole soccer team for what it costs to dress one 
football player?" 
</P>
<P>
Making sure he had a place large enough to accommodate the throngs, Jack booked 
his games in the Rose Bowl, capacity 106,000. Opening night, he looked 
wistfully at a Zorro audience of 1,251. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros selected as home the L.A. Coliseum, capacity 93,000. Asked by a 
sportswriter for two tickets to the opener, the publicist responded, "How about 
a section?" 
</P>
<P>
If one got into a soccer deal, who needed Lincoln Savings? 
</P>
<P>
Feeling it had found the Lost Dutchman mine, CBS came aboard, blowing an 
immense amount of money in putting the games on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Those who like soccer still aren't able to believe they have on their hands in 
this country a spectator disaster. The game, they argue, has a massive base, 
stemming from 8,000,000 amateurs who are playing the sport at levels ranging 
from 4-year-olds to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Fans, soccer boosters insist, identify with the pro players, who are average in 
appearance. They don't weigh 275. They don't rise 7 feet. They have the teeth 
they came with. 
</P>
<P>
When the late Abe Saperstein formed the American Basketball League, he promised 
to put players on the floor of normal height. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is sick of looking at freaks," announced Abe, who, crashing with 
his league, misread public taste. 
</P>
<P>
Are soccer players too normal for the game's good? 
</P>
<P>
Those trying to explain why the sport can't build a flame in American hearts 
usually begin by noting that soccer bucks baseball, and is judged by football. 
</P>
<P>
Will fans accustomed to watching the 49ers move the ball sit still for a Soviet 
Union-Colombia match the other night, ending 1-0 with a penalty kick in 
overtime? 
</P>
<P>
In soccer, 1-0 can be a slugfest. The Netherlands and Italy, two of the world's 
top teams, played to a scoreless draw earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Then it has been asked whether Americans reject soccer because teams here have 
featured too many foreigners? Well, baseball brims with Dominicans, Puerto 
Ricans, Cubans and Panamanians, and the only ones rejected are those who hit 
.210. 
</P>
<P>
But, for all its reversals in the United States, soccer remains hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the Wichita Wings assured us one day: "It's just a 
matter of getting our foot in the American door. We have a fast, lively 
product. Our players are appealing. They don't wear pads, helmets, or face 
masks. And the ball is easier to follow than a puck." 
</P>
<P>
It even may be easier to follow than a horse on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer makes a compelling argument. All it has to do is sell it to those who 
don't buy its tickets.

<TEXT>
   He may have been half a hemisphere
away, but there was one thing back home in Washington that did not
slip the mind of Vice President Dan Quayle.
   ``George Bush's birthday is something I could not forget,''
Quayle said Monday as he sat in the luxurious hilltop residence of
U.S. Ambassador Everett E. Briggs.
   Quayle had a good reason for remembering the occasion despite a
day filled with plane, helicopter and motorcade trips across two
countries and a myriad of meetings that focused on the region.
   ``Because it also happens to be my mother's birthday,'' Quayle
said.
   He said he cabled birthday greetings to Washington for the
president. But his 67-year-old mother, Corinne, had to wait for her
son's birthday wish.
   The vice president said he had tried to reach her but didn't know
where she was.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Quayle's family was also on his mind Monday as his motorcade sped
through Guatemala City.
   The vice president called the motorcade to a halt in front of a
small, open-air store and went on a short shopping spree as a crowd
of onlookers gathered.
   The saleswoman showed him T-shirts and a peasant skirt, but
Quayle had his eye on the store's assortment of soccer balls.
   Quayle bought one, saying his children _ Tucker, Benjamin and
Corinne _ were very good at the sport. But he tried it out first on
the crowd out on the sidewalk, tossing it to one lad, who deftly
returned it each time with his head.
   Quayle then threw the ball into a crowd of adults who scrambled
all over it. ``I'll never see that,'' Quayle laughed in an aside,
apparently thinking he would not get the ball back. But sure enough
it popped into the air, tossed right to him as he entered his limo.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Quayle's visit to the U.S. military training installation at Soto
Cano Air Force Base caused considerable interest among the service
members who are restricted to the base for their training.
   Quayle reviewed the troops, dressed in camouflage fatigues, then
headed to the rustic wooden mess hall for a cafeteria lunch of beef,
potatoes and salad. Quayle had 20 men sitting on either side of him.
   How were these soldiers selected from the 1,200 at the base?
   Army chaplain Brent Causey of Sacramento, Calif., said he won the
privilege of sitting at the head of the table because he happened to
be the only chaplain. The others were commanders and ``soldier of
the month'' winners.
   Soldiers of the month are selected from each service _ Army,
Navy, Air Force and Marines _ on the basis of an academic test,
according to Causey. The soldiers are tested on such skills as
mathematics and other school subjects, he said.

CAMP OFFERS YOUTHS A NON-COMPETITIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, Gray is a Van Nuys free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Wade is less than five feet tall, yet he's preparing for a place as point 
guard on an NBA basketball team. That may not be impossible. Eric is 10 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the past four summers, he has spent a month of mornings at Cal State 
Northridge's Summer Youth Fitness and Sports Camp, a 25-year-old nonprofit, 
program for 7- to 12-year-old boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
The camp isn't designed to turn youngsters into superstars but to provide a 
noncompetitive learning environment, said William J. Vincent, director of the 
camp and a CSUN faculty member. Every day, the children rotate through four 
classes on the campus: swimming, which ranges from basic instruction for 
non-swimmers to diving and water safety; gymnastics; games, such as 
shuffleboard, jump rope, handball and kick ball; and other sports, including 
volleyball, basketball and soccer. Badminton, tennis and golf are taught the 
older children. 
</P>
<P>
Staffed by CSUN's Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education faculty and 
community teachers, the camp is committed to teaching those with perceptual 
motor problems or medical disabilities as well as those who already excel in 
sports, Vincent said. Students are recruited through flyers and brochures sent 
to local schools. 
</P>
<P>
The staff focuses on the "total person concept: helping the students learn 
cooperation and social skills and building self-esteem and self-image," Vincent 
said. As soon as children start doing well on the playground -- having the 
motor coordination, strength and skill to play typical games and sports -- they 
feel more self-confident and make friends more easily, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Cratty, program director of the Center for the Improvement of Physical 
Coordination in West Los Angeles and professor of kinesiology at UCLA, said 
there are three types of self-esteem in children: social, intellectual and 
physical ability. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skill on Playground 
</P>
<P>
He said studies show that by increasing a child's physical ability, his 
intellectual self-esteem can rise too. Gifted children and those with learning 
disabilities are often what he terms awkward, and the tack to take is to do 
what you can to help them improve their coordination and skill on the 
playground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The CSUN program provides basic assessment as well as coordination and skill 
training, Vincent said. It offers posture analysis with a written evaluation to 
parents, a screening system for such divergences as scoliosis (lateral 
curvature of the spine), knock knee (when the child stands with the knees 
together and the ankles do not meet) and bowlegs. 
</P>
<P>
The camp also administers a national fitness test that checks for 
cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, overall endurance and body fat 
percentage. The results are computer-generated and recorded, and returning 
students can compare their past records each year. Both tests are valuable 
because they are not usually offered in public or private schools, Vincent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most students who attend the camp are from nearby because there is no 
transportation available through the program. At least 50% of the 200 students 
have attended in previous years, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Survey 
</P>
<P>
According to Denise Austin, a consultant to the President's Council on Physical 
Education and Sports, a council survey showed that "90% of all children ages 6 
to 12 fail the presidential sports tests. And 90% can't do one chin-up. Only 
one-sixth of all boys who take the test can do 40 sit-ups in one minute, and a 
study in 'The Physician and Sports Medicine Journal' estimated that 15% to 25% 
of U.S. schoolchildren are obese." 
</P>
<P>
Austin said the decrease in physical ability has taken place just since 1974, 
when more rigorous physical education routines were still budgeted in most of 
the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James G. Garrick, an orthopedic surgeon and director of the Center for 
Sports Medicine at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, said, "The 
fitness levels of children and adolescents have been declining for over two 
decades." 
</P>
<P>
The decreased availability of education dollars makes changing physical 
education programs in the schools an unrealistic goal, Garrick said. He favors 
"an enhancement of extra-scholastic youth sports programs and increased 
education and pressure from parents and the medical profession." 
</P>
<P>
As for participants in the CSUN program, Merrill Hardy, professor of physical 
education at CSUN and the swimming teacher at the Youth Fitness and Sports 
Camp, said they are a fairly homogeneous group, but "a lot of parents have 
their kids in the program because they are less fit, less coordinated than 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy does not think that the decrease in children's fitness levels would come 
as a surprise to anyone. Television, videotapes and games have turned them into 
couch potatoes, and physical education has become increasingly a part-time 
elective at most junior and senior high schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Develop Basic Skills 
</P>
<P>
The key in extracurricular programs, such as CSUN's, is to develop basic 
movement skills in children so they can succeed and truly enjoy athletics and 
sports, beginning at as early an age as possible, Hardy said. "Kids who don't 
move successfully don't tend to exercise," he said. The CSUN camp started, in 
fact, as a demonstration school for elementary school education, an attempt to 
show CSUN students and the community an ideal approach to teaching fitness. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy suggests that "parents look for programs that offer these kinds of 
opportunities for kids, such as the Department of Parks and Recreation programs 
-- at local parks -- and the YMCA." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent warns against signing children up for such sports as T-Ball and soccer 
too quickly. Not only may parents be limiting the range of choices a child may 
make regarding his favorite activities, but the competitive, organized sports 
tend to attract the cream of the crop. Youngsters with motor weakness or the 
need for skill training may be left on the bench, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy recommends that parents limit television to a specific hour of the day, 
and that they suggest or require 30 minutes a day of physical activity. 
"Parents are short-changing their kids if they don't help them find one to two 
things they will really enjoy doing athletically, to have the opportunity to 
succeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing their parents enjoying an activity does more than anything to get kids 
interested in fitness," he said.

The camp costs $260 for a one-month session of half-day classes held five 
mornings a week. There is one teacher for every 12 children at the session, 
which is in July. For information about next year's enrollment, call (818) 
885-2661.

   First come the ambassadors of Chad and Niger,
puffing and swinging their arms as they jog around the sports field.
Behind them is the envoy from Togo, sweat pouring down his face.
Bringing up the rear is the ambassador of Burkina Faso, pedaling a
bicycle.
   Just a normal Saturday morning for the diplomats from
French-speaking Africa. They gather at 9, jog for a while, swing
from exercise bars, then get down to a rough-and-tumble soccer match.
   ``Attrape le bal, attrape le bal!'' (catch the ball) screamed His
Excellency Ellom-Kodjo Schuppius of Togo as the ball zoomed to the
edge of the field.
   This time the diplomats were playing against some African
students who generally turn up at the field Saturday mornings. Other
times they just kick the ball around among themselves.
   All week long the diplomats sit behind their desks, hold meetings
and attend receptions. The weekly workout is a chance to sweat the
whiskey and good food out of their systems and keep in shape, they
said.
   But when they discard their formal attire, they are still mindful
of their position. One is wearing a Dior sweat suit, another sports
a Gucci.
   ``We believe in a sound mind in a sound body,'' said Paul-Desire
Kabore, the ambassador of Burkina Faso who acts as dean of the
informal ambassadorial club. The club unites 12 French-speaking
African countries, some of the poorest in the world, who pool their
time and resources to attract U.S. investment and organize projects
to benefit their homelands.
   The others are Benin, Ivory Coast, Congo, Central African
Republic, Mali, Senegal, Rwanda and Guinea.
   The 12 ambassadors are traveling to Denver next month to take
part in a trade and investment fair, and they hope to get a game
together there, possibly with some of the American participants,
Kabore said.
   Ambassadors who are too out of shape to play soccer or jog
sometimes come out on Saturday mornings to watch or walk laps around
the field.
   Ambassador Moumouni Adamou Djermakoye of Niger is an active
participant. In fact, he might be called an over-achiever. In
addition to the weekly match and jogging, he rides his bicycle 13
miles every Sunday and plays basketball.
   He has already held the posts of foreign affairs minister,
minister of health, youth and sports, and served as a regional
governor. He came to Washington a year ago.
   Togo's Schuppius, who has been here six years, also plays tennis
on the weekends and walks everywhere he can. ``It helps me get in
shape, mentally and physically, for the week,'' he said.
   Many ambassadors in Washington have swimming pools and tennis
courts at their residences. Not so most of the Africans, whose
budgets are limited.
   Chad's Mahammat Ali Adoun said he wouldn't know what to do with a
pool, anyway. ``I can't swim. My country is very dry,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, he appears in good shape, tall and well-muscled. ``I
jog several rounds, then I hang on the bars _ have to exercise those
pectorals and abdominals,'' he said. ``At home, it's too hot to
exercise like this.''
   At home, soccer is a national pastime.
   The African students do not appear intimidated by their
distinguished opponents. The soccer game is for fun. No score is
kept of winners or losers. ``Our health is the winner,'' said Kabore.

FT  07 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Where dribbling is child's play - Peter
Berlin in New York on the next generation of soccer fans and the star
players they idolise
</HEADLINE>

Soccer in the US is the world's largest child-minding service. The US Soccer
Federation claims 16m registered players - more than any other Fifa member -
of whom most are children.
At World Cup games, middle-aged middle Americans are a common sight. Almost
always they are being led through colourful crowds by an excited child
wearing a T-shirt commemorating his or her participation in some age-group
soccer tournament.
Fifa and the World Cup organisers have played the child card ruthlessly. The
ceremonies at each stadium consist largely of poorly-drilled hordes of
children, clad in youth-league kit, parading round the ground holding flags
and balloons.
Before each game, half-a-dozen children carry the yellow 'Fair Play Please'
banner on to the field to the tune of the Fifa anthem. There is calculated
naivety in this, as anyone who can recall their childhood soccer - or who
has watched children playing unsupervised - will know.
Park or playground 'rules' are highly negotiable. Touchlines and goal-lines
are elastic. Goalkeepers change without warning. Games often end in heated,
perhaps violent debate over some foul.
Yet one thing children rarely do is kick each other. And suddenly the
professionals are kicking each other much less often, too - not in the
interests of fair play but because referees have been punishing them.
The World Cup record for yellow cards, 163, set in Italy four years ago, was
broken last Saturday, the mid-way point. By Tuesday the total was 198 after
44 matches. Sendings-off are rising - five in the last three second-round
games - leaving matches with the unbalanced look of park games, where sides
always seem to be picked from an odd number of players.
There is another influence at work. The heat has sapped the professionals'
stamina. Last Saturday's game between Saudi Arabia and Sweden, in blazing
afternoon Dallas, resembled a three-hour game between 11-year-olds in a hot
summer park.
The impression that this was a children's game was heightened by the way the
Saudis play. The Swedes are typical products of western European
professional soccer - scouted by clubs in their teens or earlier; coached
from an early age; accustomed from youth to playing in organised leagues.
They have been taught to forget what every child knows about soccer. With
the exception of Tomas Brolin and, once, Kennet Andersson, the Swedes knew
better than to dribble the ball past opponents. They know that if they
dribble they will be kicked, or might lose the ball - the cardinal sin - and
have no-one to blame. How much easier not to take chances.
But the Saudis took risks. Time and again Saeed Owairan tried to unpick the
Swedish defence, as he had Belgium's, with mazy dribbling. Hamzah Falatah
tormented the full-backs with feints and dummies. Finally, Fahad
Al-Ghashiyan scored the goal his team deserved with a move straight from the
park.
Where most European pros, wide by the goal-line and confronted by a
defender, have turned and rolled the ball back down the wing to a supporting
player, Fahad Al-Ghashiyan did what any child unworried by failure,
unwilling to surrender the precious ball, eager to show off, would have
tried. He ran at his man, beat him and banged home a goal.
This childlike quality, not to be confused with innocence or
under-development, has not been totally expunged from European soccer. Jason
McAteer, at 24 one of the babes of the Irish squad, started the season
unsure of a regular place at Bolton Wanderers, a lowly English first
division team. He ended it by playing in the World Cup, chasing Franco
Baresi round Giants Stadium. McAteer was a breath of fresh air, trying to
dribble at Paolo Maldini or flick the ball over Frank Rijkaard's head.
The Saudis do not just dribble. They also take evident pleasure in the feel
of the ball. Each pass was delivered with an unnecessary but attractive
flourish; each pass received with a little juggle of joy.
One of the delights of this tournament has been the reminder that the range
of soccer possibilities is a wide one. The Asian and African teams, Brazil,
Mexico and Colombia, have all solved the simple problems of soccer in
distinct ways.
They kick and trap the ball differently. Their formations are different. In
familiar situations they produce unfamiliar passes, or dribble when they
should not. But dribbling takes courage, flamboyance and close-ball skills.
Children in playgrounds and parks all over Europe will try to emulate them,
just as they always try to emulate players who bring the most childlike
qualities into play. This is why Ryan Giggs, Manchester United's child-faced
dribbler, is the hottest commercial property in English soccer.
It is why the most interesting players in this World Cup are those who
remain recognisably children playing a children's game, such as baby-faced
Gary Kelly, the Irish full-back, who insisted on dribbling out of defence,
risking all for a chance to display his pace and skill. There is Marc
Overmars, the tiny Dutch winger, one of several examples of the success of
the Dutch system in nurturing a youngster's love of the dribble.
There is pudgy Tomas Brolin of Sweden and Sergi, the dribbling Spaniard.
Nigeria fielded an entire team composed of players barely out of their
teens.
There is Romario of Brazil, refusing to pass to team-mates in better
positions, abandoning his position to drop back to mid-field because he
wants more of the ball, refusing to acknowledge team-mates who create
scoring chances for him, yet somehow much more interesting than the equally
talented, nicer, more mature Bebeto.
There was always a Gheorghe Hagi in the parks of my childhood. Hagi is the
best boy on the field, and knows it. He often expects the other Romanians to
do the things he does not like: running, defending, tackling. His effort in
the second half against Switzerland was that of a sulking child. For all his
talent he is simply too unappealing to inspire imitators.
And then there is the greatest child-genius of all: Diego Maradona, who
carried the hopes of Argentina from his early teens, a player deprived of a
childhood, except that his whole life has been a childhood. After his
drugs-bust he blamed other people - adults - for his downfall.
Children, as adults often forget, can be clear-eyed and forgiving in judging
fallen heroes. If you go down to the park today, among the children
imitating Saeed Owairan's dribbles, Martin Dahlin's flying headers,
Romario's shooting and the Cameroonian goal wiggle, there will be others
trying to emulate Maradona's goal against Greece and his screaming,
eye-bulging, celebratory run at the camera afterwards.
Maradona. A child playing a child's game without a child-minder. It
shouldn't have been allowed.
