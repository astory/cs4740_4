<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "'Ali Nasir Rejects the New </F>
State in the South and Urges Cancellation of the Secession and 
Resumption of Dialogue"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus -- 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former south 
Yemeni president, has confirmed the statement made by 'Abdallah 
Ahmad Ghanim, the Yemeni justice minister in the Sanaa 
government, to the effect that 'Ali Salim al-Bid had telephoned 
'Ali Nasir Muhammad, who lives in Damascus, and offered him the 
post of vice president in the Democratic Republic of Yemen which 
was declared three days ago, on the basis that al-Bid would 
resign six months later and 'Ali Nasir Muhammad would become 
head of state. 
  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that he 
rejected the offer which he saw as tantamount to partition of 
Yemen which would be "a crime against unity." He added: "They 
tried to persuade me by all means in three contacts. I told 
them that I could not accept." He said that "'Ali Salim al-Bid 
offered to send today -- that is immediately -- a special plane 
to take me to him in Hadramaut. I refused and told him that I 
was prepared to return on certain conditions. The first was 
restoration of unity. And I said that I would be willing to 
work for a cease-fire and a return to dialogue and prevent the 
country's destruction. I asked him to postpone everything for 
48 hours, not to make any decisions, and revoke south Yemen's 
secession decision and return to dialogue and a cease-fire, and 
said that I would be willing to hold contacts with Sanaa and 
Aden to promote dialogue and understanding." 
  'Ali Nasir Muhammad added: "I rejected al-Bid's offer 
because I care about Yemen's unity and because I still maintain 
my principled position stated before and after these events, 
namely that I am opposed to infighting and secession. I 
emphasized in all their contacts with me and my contacts with 
them that the Yemeni solution must be within the framework of 
the unity state not outside it, that whatever the problems and 
mistakes encountered throughout the unity march, they did not 
justify secession at all, and that a distinction should be made 
between disagreement with the Yemeni president and the cause of 
Yemen's unity. Individuals disappear but unity and the people 
live on." [passage omitted] 
  Asked what he thought were the chances of survival for south 
Yemen's secession, he said "I can confirm that the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] played a significant part, along with the 
other political groups and the General People's Congress [GPC], 
in achieving unity, that the YSP derived its strength from its 
support for unity, and that abandoning unity now would mean 
suicide and would mean the end of the party." [passage omitted] 
  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad said that he did not know if 
the Gulf states or any state had any intention of recognizing 
the new south Yemeni state. He said they would have to think 
hard before taking such a step. 
  Commenting on (north) Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's 
position on what has happened, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad said: "In a 
telephone conversation I had with President Salih yesterday, he 
assured me that he would never accept the secession which is 
considered as high national treason, that there would be no 
going back on unity, that he would not accept the secession of 
the south as a fait accompli, and that he was prepared to hold a 
dialogue with the YSP or with the unionist forces within the YSP 
to rescue Yemen and its unity. I, in turn, stressed to him the 
need for a dialogue with the unionist forces in the YSP and 
asked him to keep the door open for dialogue despite the wounds." 
  The former Yemeni president also said: "I am now 
endeavoring and trying, along with some of the people who 
support unity and who are loyal to the Yemeni people, to promote 
such a dialogue between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the 
YSP. That is what I am working for in my current contacts." 
  Asked if Arab mediation has been suspended, he said: "There 
is no Arab mediation. There is Arab League mediation. Arab 
League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has, in a 
telephone conversation, assured me that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has 
left the door open for dialogue with the Arab League and the 
Arab states." 
  On the reports claiming that a number of his supporters 
including the newly appointed Defense Minister 'Abd-Rabbuh Hadi 
Mansur, Social Security Minister Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Batani, 
and Colonel al-Khadr al-'Aqil, were killed in a car accident, 
giving rise to widespread speculations, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
said: "That is not true. I contacted them a short while ago 
and spoke to them personally and reassured myself about their 
health. What was published about them having been killed is not 
true. They are alive and well." 
  The former Yemeni president showed annoyance at the 
appointment of Sulayman Nasir Mas'ud, formerly one of his 
supporters, as a member of the southern Presidential Council. 
He said: "I have nothing to do with that appointment or with 
him. I was not consulted. As a matter of principle I reject 
the secession and I naturally reject his appointment. It is not 
just a question of rejecting the appointment. I reject the 
whole idea. He does not represent me and I have nothing to do 
with him." [passage omitted]

presidential council for the independent state newly proclaimed

<F P=106> [Reports by Salwa al-Ustuwani in Damascus and AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT bureau in Amman: "Restructuring of the Northern and 
Southern Commands Paves the Way for a New Phase in the Yemeni 
War"] 
  [Excerpts] According to Yemeni military sources, battles 
raged yesterday in the town of Zinjibar and extended to 
al-Bayda' Governorate in the north in the areas of al-Kawd and 
al-'Urqub and all the way to Mukayris. It seems that the 
northern al-'Amaliqah forces deployed there are drawning their 
last breath. The northern command had pinned great hopes on them 
for victory and for the occupation of Aden, and they were 
considered the pincers in the area to the north of Aden. 
  As regards the other forces which have been trying to 
besiege 
Aden from the north and the west in the 
Ta'izz-al-Rahidah-Mawiyah axis, they have withdrawn from the 
borders and from the areas they had occupied to the north of 
Ta'izz Governorate. [passage omitted] 
  In the course of the re-formation of the southern command, 
new appointments have been made in the various sectors as 
follows: 
  1. The eastern front (the governorates of Shabwah and 
Hadramaut): The operations there are supervised by Salih 
Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, former oil and mineral resources minister 
and chief of staff in the south. 
  2. The Abyan-al-Bayda' front is under the command of Abyan 
Governor Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad. 
  3. The Kirsh front is under the command of Colonel Qasim 
Bin-Yahya. 
  4. The Maqtabah front is under the command of Salih 'Ubayd 
Ahmad, former deputy prime minister who was defense minister 
before the unity. 
  5. The Ta'izz and Ibb brigades are under the command of 
Housing and Planning Minister Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah (Muhsin) 
and Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar (both members of the 
Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]), and 
Sultan al-Sami'i, the formerly independent deputy. 
  As regards the northern command, it has been formed as 
follows: 
  1. Ahmad Musa'id Husayn (member of the General Committee -- 
the Political Bureau -- of the General People's Congress [GPC]): 
Command of the Shabwah front. 
  2. 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, the new defense minister, and 
Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Husayni: Al-Bayda' command. 
  All three of them [as published] are former south Yemeni 
President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad's men. 
  3. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, Muhammad Salim Basindwah, 
Ahmad Faraj, and 'Abdallah al-Qadi: Ta'izz command. 
  4. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani and a group of central areas 
officers: Ibb command. 
  5. (Central Security Commander) Muhammad 'Abdallah Salih, 
(Air Force Commander) 'Ali Salih al-Ahmar, (1st Armored Division 
Commander) 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, and (Information Minister) 
Hasan al-Lawzi: Sanaa area command. The aim is to purge it of 
the political parties and others who sympathize with the YSP. 
  6. 'Abd-al-Rahman Muhammad 'Ali 'Uthman, 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-zayn, and other leadership and staff members: Command of 
al-Hudaydah front. 
  Meanwhile, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has obtained some information 
about the arrest of a group of Sudanese and Iraqis in Aden and 
the arrest of 60 members of the extremist Afghan Jihad members 
in al-Dali'. There is information confirming that Eritrea has 
admitted into its airports a group of northern civilian planes 
which were taken to Asmara Airport out of fear that they might 
have been a target of attack at the airports of Ta'izz, Sanaa, 
and al-Hudaydah. 
  Although YSP sources have refused to confirm that Eritrean 
airports were used in the Yemeni war, some reports say that the 
southerners bombed Asmara airport after discovering that 
northern military aircraft had taken off from there. 
  The reports add that the north paid Eritrean President 
Isaias 
Afewerki $20 million for allowing the planes into his country's 
airport. 
  Sources close to the Yemeni Defense Ministry have told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the southern 'Abbud Brigade, in 
cooperation with the public in al-Dali' Directorate in the Lahij 
Governorate, successfully confronted the attack launched by 
northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
consisting of al-Hamzah Brigade reinforced by selected 
Republican Guard forces. The Defense Ministry in Aden said the 
result was a "crushing" defeat for the northern forces which had 
to retreat. 
  The sources said that the 'Abbud Brigade's forces, which are 
under the command of Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General 
Haytham Qasim Tahir, captured 15 tanks and destroyed 10 tanks 
and a number of vehicles and troop carriers, but the Defense 
Ministry did not give the human losses on both sides. 
  Sanaa has not denied that report to close politicians and 
reporters, who are finding it difficult to contact the outside 
world and who see Sanaa's silence about these battles of the 
past two days as an indication that the results were not in its 
favor. 
  Sources of the Yemeni Defense Ministry in the south said 
that 
four of Sanaa's Russian-made aircraft were shot down as they 
attacked civilian targets in Aden. Two of the pilots were 
captured. One of them is an Egyptian Islamic extremist and the 
other an Iraqi from the Iraqi Air Force. The other two were 
killed when their two aircraft exploded in mid-air. 
  The sources attribute the use of Iraqi pilots in the Yemeni 
war to the weakness of north Yemeni pilots and the warm 
relations between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn. Before the outbreak of battles, 
political and press sources said that a number of Iraqi military 
experts had arrived in Sanaa. [passage omitted] 
  In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Damascus, 
Yemeni military sources said that the planes which bombed Aden 
were Yemeni planes which took off from military airfields in 
Eritrea and were flown by Iraqi pilots. It seems that Iraq 
entered the battle through Eritrea after the latter was paid 
large sums of money. [passage omitted]

  The chairman of the Presidential Council, taking cognizance 
of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen and out of faith in

genuine spirit of tolerance existing in the mind and conscience 
of our people; out of absolute commitment to the duty of 
preserving the unity of the homeland and the cohesion of the 
Yemeni society in the various parts of the Republic of Yemen; 
out of concern that all the sons of the Yemeni people will 
participate in the march of national construction and contain 
the regrettable repercussions of the internal sedition caused by 
the rebellion of criminal secessionist elements against the 
constitutional legitimacy and the subsequent explosion of the 
military situation and the direct threat posed to the unity of 
the homeland and the security and stability of citizens; in view 
of all this and due to the requirements of the supreme national 
interest; and following the approval of the Council of Ministers 
and Presidential Council, decrees the following:

whose names are given in the arrest warrant issued by the public 
prosecutor of the republic on 23 May, a general amnesty shall be 
granted to all the civilian and military men who, under the 
hegemony of the criminal secessionist clique, acted or behaved 
in a manner conflicting with the Constitution and punishable 
under the law. According to this decree, they will enjoy their 
full political and civilian rights and will continue to assume 
their responsibilities in the various places of work and 
production under commitment to constitutional legitimacy. 
  Article 2: Everyone who abides by the constitutional 
legitimacy shall benefit from this amnesty.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>
  [Text] Former South Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
has told AL-DUSTUR that he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib are 
currently working on an initiative to stop the Yemeni war. In 
the meantime, sources close to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
leadership said forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
have reached the environs of the Hadhramaut Governorate, which 
is adjacent to the Shabwah Governorate. 
  YSP sources expressed doubts that the president's forces 
will 
be able to continue to advance to al-Mukalla, the capital of 
Hadhramaut, where 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who declared himself 
president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen a few days ago, is 
now present. They say these forces cannot deploy over a vast 
area and maintain their cohesion at the same time. 
  These sources believe that the opening of the eastern front 
by the forces of legitimacy in Shabwah was not meant to achieve 
military as much as political and economic gains represented in 
sharing the Shabwah oil revenues. 
  Reached by telephone in Damascus, the former Yemeni 
president 
told AL-DUSTUR that he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, the 
well-known national figure, will propose an initiative aimed at 
preserving the Yemeni unity and effecting a cease-fire. 
  'Ali Nasir declined to elaborate on this initiative at 
present as its publication may undermine the current efforts and 
contacts with the two parties to the conflict, indicating that 
he himself had earlier announced his rejection of 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid's secession decision. He said: We want a solution that 
guarantees the Yemeni unity, spares blood, leads to a 
cease-fire, and solves problems within the framework of the 
state of unity. He expressed hope that the anticipated solution 
may lie in an agreement by the two warring parties to 
simultaneously announce the following: 
  1. Preserving unity and canceling the secession decision. 
  2. Ceasing fire immediately. 
  3. Lifting the siege clamped on Aden. 
  The former Yemeni president said this can be followed by 
searching for a new formula that guarantees the existence of one 
central state that is capable of survival. 
  Asked by AL-DUSTUR if these are the main points of the 
initiative he and Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib are proposing, he 
said the initiative contains other details. 
  'Ali Nasir Muhammad denied a statement by 'Abd-al-Qawi 
Makkawi two days ago that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid have agreed to meet in Paris. He said: We are still 
contacting the two men in order to reach a cease-fire first. We 
will arrange for a meeting between the two at a later stage. 
  In a related development, YSP sources expressed surprise at 
the delay in Kuwaiti recognition of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen and said that Kuwait was expected to be the first state to 
recognize the new state and that Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh 
Sabah al-Ahmad was expected to visit Aden and announce his 
country's recognition from there. The sources attributed this 
delay to possible strong foreign pressure by international 
powers like the United States and other regional forces.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic on 30 March 
publishes on page 5 an approximately 4,000-word report on the 
suspects charged in connection with a spate of recent explosions 
in Jordan. 
  AL-BILAD, "an independent political weekly," claims to have 
accompanied Major Muhannad Hijazi, the public prosecutor of the 
State Security Court, and the defendants to the sites targeted 
for explosions. The defendants were reported to have been in 
good health. They were also reported to have said that they are 
"heroes" because they carried out these bombings. The argument 
that they advanced is that they were carrying out God's 
injunction against "debauchery." They reportedly planned to 
establish a caliphate, assassinate intelligence and army 
personnel, and kill the Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks 
teams to halt the march of "capitulation," as they put it. 
  The weekly states that 'Abdallah Kamil al-Shuraydah 
al-Hashayikah is the principal defendant in the series of 
bombings that have recently taken place in Jordan. The weekly 
notes that al-Hashayikah, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, 
Suwaylih Branch, left Amman in 1990 to work as a teacher of 
Arabic in the Philippines, where he also taught at the al-Imam 
al-Shafi'i Foundation. This foundation is supervised by Jamal 
Khalifah, also known as Abi-Bara', a Saudi national and an 
in-law of Usamah Bin-Ladin, a Saudi national of Yemeni origin 
currently living in Khartoum, Sudan. Khalifah, Bin-Ladin's 
right hand-man, is reported to be close to the ruling Saudi 
family. 
  According to the paper, al-Hashayikah discussed with 
Khalifah 
the idea of launching of an organization in Jordan to "eradicate 
forbidden conduct by force" in order to lay the groundwork for 
establishing a caliphate in Jordan. This idea was well received 
by Jamal Khalifah. The recruits of the organization would be 
Jordanians who received military training in Afghanistan during 
the war with the Soviets. The only thing the organization 
needed was financing. The report states that this all happened 
while the two were in the Philippines. Al-Hashayikah returned 
to Amman early this year to launch his organization so that he 
might receive the promised finances from Bin-Ladin, and Jamal 
Khalifah, "the mastermind of Bin-Ladin's terrorist operations in 
the Arab world." 
  The article continues, noting that the organization 
al-Hashayikah used had already taken its final shape before he 
left for the Philippines. It had a joint command consisting of 
himself, as well as Jihad al-Tanjir, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud, 
and Isma'il al-'Amayirah. They used mosques and places of 
worship to "concoct conspiracies." The recruits of the 
organization received refresher courses in military training 
during further visits to Afghanistan via Saudi Arabia or Yemen. 
  According to the paper, "Bin-Ladin's group" received the 
recruits in Saudi Arabia upon their arrival there, and provided 
them with the necessary visas and air tickets to Pakistan, where 
they then traveled to Afghanistan. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zandani, representative of the Yemeni Reform Grouping at the 
Yemeni Presidential Council, is reported to have provided the 
Afghan Arabs stopping over in Yemen en route to Afghanistan with 
the necessary visas and air tickets, as well as "his constant 
financial support for the organization." 
  The weekly also claims that some of the organization members 
remained in Jordan to plan bomb attacks and recruit other 
members. Having faced difficulties in acquiring the necessary 
explosives in Jordan, the organization sent Zakariyah Muhammad 
Dawud Qasim to Yemen, where he was trained in how to manufacture 
sophisticated explosives. He was also trained in detonating 
explosives by remote control. 
  The paper explains that, in order to achieve its objectives, 
the organization believed that it had to kill Arab and Muslim 
leaders who do not apply the Islamic sharia in their countries. 
It also believed that it had to resist the ongoing Middle East 
peace negotiations by all means, including the use of force. 
The organization also planned to blow up movie theaters, 
nightclubs, bars, tourist areas, liquor stores, and public areas 
where the two sexes mingle, such as the Housing Bank Complex. 
The organization also planned to assassinate senior 
intelligence, army, and public security personnel in order to 
pave the way for the creation of a caliphate in Jordan. 
  Noting a plan by the organization to assassinate the 
Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks negotiators, AL-BILAD 
says: "In addition to carrying out bombings, the organization 
members entertained the idea of drawing up a full-fledged plan 
to liquidate Jordanian and Palestinian peace negotiators, headed 
by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, former head of 
the Jordanian delegation to the peace talks. 
  According to the paper, the group found al-Majali's home 
telephone number, and telephoned him, telling him they were 
journalists working for a local daily. They asked for a date 
for an important press interview with him. Al-Majali agreed to 
grant them an interview. Al-Majali was meant to be assassinated 
during this bogus interview, according to the report, which it 
said was planned with a great deal of cleverness. A date was 
set for the interview and forty-eight hours before the interview 
was scheduled to take place, the organization leadership had 
drawn up a detailed plan to assassinate al-Majali by explosive 
charges and other weapons to be carried by the bogus press team, 
which would have consisted of reporters and cameramen. 
  The paper says it was only divine providence that intervened 
to save al-Majali, who was assigned an official mission outside 
Jordan. This mission required him to travel to Washington ahead 
of the time set for the implementation of the assassination 
plan. Thus, the bogus interview date was postponed to a later 
date. However, this date has never materialized because the 
culprits were apprehended. 
  The weekly paper goes on to say that, having failed in their 
bid to liquidate al-Majali, the organization members attempted 
to assassinate members of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Middle East peace talks, including Faysal al-Husayni and Hanan 
'Ashrawi. However, stringent security precautions and the 
secrecy with which al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi surround their moves 
thwarted the defendants' scheme. Undeterred by their failure, 
the defendants recruited an employee of the Grand Palace Hotel, 
where the Palestinian peace negotiators stayed. The hotel 
employee was asked to plant explosive charges in the peace 
negotiators' rooms. Once again, strict security precautions 
thwarted their scheme. 
  According to the report, the failure of the organization's 
assassination scheme prompted the organization command to 
endorse a plan of explosions in Jordan to convince Jamal 
Khalifah to finance the organization. This resulted in 
explosions at movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa'. However, 
attempts to carry out further explosions elsewhere in Jordan 
failed. 
  Muhammad 'Ali Shihadah is reportedly the "organization's 
mastermind responsible for picking explosion targets." 
  The paper's investigations indicated that 'Abdallah Diyyah, 
a 
prominent Suwaylih-based Muslim Brotherhood member, was 
acquainted with the organization's scheme by 'Abdallah 
al-Hashayikah. However, Muslim Brotherhood sources ruled out 
Diyyah's involvement in this scheme. 
  Elaborating further on this issue, the paper says: "Several 
quarters insinuated that the Muslim Brotherhood could be 
implicated in these explosion incidents, particularly since 
al-Hashayikah was a Brotherhood leader in Suwaylih, not to 
mention the fact that Diyyah was close to the hawkish wing of 
the Muslim Brotherhood. Meanwhile, informed sources ruled out 
this possibility, which has not been confirmed by the 
interrogations conducted with the defendants. 
  "AL-BILAD has learned that 23 persons have been implicated 
in 
the recent spate of explosions. They will stand trial at the 
State Security Court within the next two weeks. If found 
guilty, they could receive punitive measures, including the 
death sentence. These defendants are the following: 'Abd Salih 
Husayn al-Jahalin, Muhammad 'Ali Husayn Shihadah Abu-'Ayyad, 
Yasin Hasan Muhammad Zahrah, Hasan Hamdan Hasan 'Abd-al-Qadir, 
Muhammad Salih Musa 'Aqil, Sulayman Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Al Bisah, 
Muhammad Ahmad 'Abd-al-Fattah al-'Adharibah, Samir Ahmad 
Muhammad Tilagh, 'Abd-al-Nasir Mahmud Muhammad Yunus, Fa'iq 
Salih Yusuf al-Shawish, 'Umar Jibril Muhammad al-Shawahin, 
'Abdallah Kamil al-Hashayikah, Jihad Ahmad Khalid al-Tanjir, 
Khalil Tawfiq Muhammad 'Alqam, Muhammad Ahmad al-Shaykh 
al-Fahmawi, Salim Musa Yusuf, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud Qasim, 
Isma'il Sa'id al-'Amayirah, Muhammad Sa'id Muqbil Dar-'Awdah, 
Walid Muhammad 'Ashsha, Muhammad Amin al-Shamasinah, Ra'd 
Khalil, and 'Abd-al-Majid al-'Adharibah." 
  AL-BILAD concludes its report by promising to provide its 
readers with further details as they unfold when the State 
Security Court begins to investigate this case. 
  No further processing planned.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the </F>
Political Bureau of the General People's Congress, by Salwa 
al-Ustuwani in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Text] 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the General 
Committee (Political Bureau) of the General People's Congress 
[GPC] and head of its General Department, has announced that the 
Sanaa government and people reject any Arab military 
intervention, and called on the Arab states to stop their media 
vituperation. 
  Yemen, he said, will solve its own problems and the battles 
will settle the situation. The Yemeni official arrived in 
Damascus two days ago to meet with Yemeni leaders and figures 
and with Syrian officials to explain the explosive situation in 
his country and convey his party's views on the situation. 
  Al-'Ansi said he did not believe that the unity [of Yemen] 
was at an end because "unity is the fate and destiny of the 
Yemeni people. That is what we will fight for." He added that 
intervention by Arab forces would mean promotion of secession. 
Our unity, he said, is not a unity between two peoples to 
warrant comparison with the Syrian-Egyptian unity. Yemen has 
been united since the beginning of time. 
  He also said: "We do not want to be carried away with the 
Western and Arab media which are now claiming that there is 
civil war. That is a misconception. What is taking place in 
Yemen is not civil war. A civil war is a war between members of 
the public or between tribes, sects, or parties." 
  What is going on, he emphasized, is fighting between armed 
forces upholding constitutional legitimacy and forces rebelling 
against legitimacy "and we consider that to be military mutiny 
which must be destroyed by military means." 
  Then, speaking tactically, he said that "the civil war 
description applies to some southern governorates where there is 
a conflict in the governorates of Abyan, Shabwah, Hadramaut, 
Lahij, and Aden between the people there, between those 
supporting the unity line and the renegade secessionist forces 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]." 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Would you bet on anyone in the south? 
  [Al-'Ansi] Yes, we bet on the unionist forces within the YSP 
and we bank on them to settle the issue and to rebel against the 
leadership which we do not consider to be legitimate. In Yemen, 
the army which is fighting the renegade and secessionist forces 
is being described by news agencies and the media as the 
northern army. It is not the northern army. It is the army of 
unity and it includes people from the south and the north. The 
opposing forces, which they describe as southern, include 
elements from the north and the south. 
  The north's big wager is on the unionist forces in Aden and 
in the armed forces. Currently there are reports that Muhammad 
'Ali Ahmad and large groups loyal to former southern President 
'Ali Nasir Muhammad are beginning to respond to YSP appeals and 
take up arms inside Aden. Battles are raging in Lahij, Radfan, 
al-Dali', Mukayris, and Abyan. There is a conflict between the 
unionists and the secessionists. But there is no fighting in 
Ibb, Ta'izz, or Sanaa. There is no fighting between the people 
nor between one force and another there. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] What, in your view, is the solution? 
  [Al-'Ansi] It is to uphold the constitution, the will of the 
people, and constitutional legitimacy. What is now being said 
about Arab mediation is a thing of the past and no longer valid. 
If, in a calm atmosphere, the mediations in Amman and Salalah 
failed, what would happen against a background of military 
conflict? 
  I urge the Arab states to refrain from mediation because 
they 
only want to take positions in the media. There are more of 
such states but they know that it would be futile to intervene 
because when guns speak, reason disappears. I urge the states 
now initiating mediations to look for something else to do. We 
Yemenis are sensitive people. Above all, we say to those who 
want to exploit the current war by internationalizing the issue 
or by sending Arab forces, or anything else, we say frankly 
that, throughout history, Yemen has been the graveyard of 
invaders. That is why we reject intervention. 
  What scares us about this talk of sending forces and of 
mediation is that they are talking about Egyptian mediation and 
dispatch of forces to disengage the warring parties. That is a 
thing of the past. The Egyptians raised it two weeks ago and a 
month ago but we rejected it because the presence of forces 
would mean partition and revival of the secession. We tell 
them: Play another game, for that is out of the question as far 
as we are concerned. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] So, in your view, what is the alternative 
solution? 
  [Al-'Ansi] They should leave us alone and let us act and 
solve our own problems by military or political means. They 
would then have a clear conscience. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Do you believe that the solution lies in the 
disappearance of the current leaderships? 
  [Al-'Ansi] Why disappearance of the leaderships? The 
solution hs been spelled out in the House of Representatives. 
It used the legitimate card and dismissed 'Ali Salim al-Bid and 
Salim Salih Muhammad from their posts in the state as 
Presidential Council members. That is a part of the solution. 
  As far as the north is concerned we have invoked 
constitutional legitimacy and the people's will. 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih is there by popular demand. When the people tell 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid to go then he must go. But for him to impose a 
rule of fire and the sword on the people, exploit the crisis, 
and, against a background of mediation, sidestep the results we 
have achieved for our people, that is totally rejected. It is 
not a personal matter between 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. I am not revealing a secret when I say that some 
members of the Yemeni House of Representatives have proposed two 
names for membership of the Presidential Council to replace 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid and Salim Salih Muhammad. They are (former 
southern President) 'Ali Nasir Muhammad and 'Abd-al-Qawi 
Makkawi. These are two patriotic figures with a formidable 
struggle record, respected by the Yemeni people. (It is well 
known that the Presidential Council consists of five members who 
are: 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and Salim Salih 
Muhammad). 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Do you believe that the pledge and accord 
document could still be implemented or should a new document or 
a new solution be considered? 
  [Al-'Ansi] The document is still suitable as far as we are 
concerned but the mechanism must change. Once 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
and Salim Salih Muhammad are out and are replaced in the 
Presidential Council by others, matters begin to crystallize and 
solutions to be implemented. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] So you are against the war decision? 
  [Al-'Ansi] Nobody wants war. It was "force majeure." Our 
war was limited and the military eruptions and escalations were 
on a limited scale, but when this war started three days ago our 
forces were hit in Abyan, the central security units in Aden 
were besieged and hit, and the power station in Dhummar was 
suddenly hit to disrupt the power supply to Sanaa, and the camps 
in Dhummar were hit. It was premeditated aggression. The 
Yemeni Army (northern) could not possibly remain idle. The war 
was imposed on us and we are fighting it in defense of 
legitimacy and to strike at the centers of mutiny. 
  I wish to stress that in many of the current battles, the 
main parties involved are not northern and southern forces but 
forces of mutiny and popular forces now fighting and resisting 
the rebels in the southern governorates. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] According to some reports, the northern 
forces have reached the outskirts of Aden. Do you believe it is 
possible to take control of Aden? 
  [Al-'Ansi] God willing, the situation will certainly be 
decided and control will be gained, and the brothers will lay 
down their arms. If they want destruction for their country, 
then they should continue their aggression but we ask them to 
lay down their arms and to stop the war. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] What is the purpose of besieging Aden? 
  [Al-'Ansi] To bring them down, arrest them, and refer them 
to trial because they are the ones who triggered the war. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] Are the north Yemeni forces fighting fit, 
enough to settle the situation in Aden? 
  [Al-'Ansi] It is not just a question of fitness. We are 
fighting for what is right and we are the stronger in that 
respect. We are fighting for a cause. I am optimistic that 
Aden will be brought under control very soon, not because we are 
the stronger in authority and in the Army but because the people 
are against mutiny and secession. 
  [Al-Ustuwani] If Aden is brought under control, what would 
be the steps to follow? 
  [Al-'Ansi] (Defense Minister) Haytham Qasim will be referred 
to trial according to the Presidential Council's decision, 
because he is to blame for the war. Those responsible for the 
Dhummar and 'Imran massacres will also be referred to trial. 
Regarding the other brothers in the south, the people have 
dismissed them from the leadership, but 'Ali Salim al-Bid cannot 
be dismissed from the post of party secretary general. What is 
important is that the party should be a party in the full sense 
of the word, without militia, without forces, and without an 
iron fist. There should be a peaceful assumption of authority. 
That is what we and the Yemeni people want.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, Presidential Council </F>
member and assistant YSP secretary general, by Salim Badawi; 
place and date not given; from the weekly "The Event" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Muhammad] Following the eruption of battles in 
Sufyan and the 3d Brigade, the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] 
called for the formation of an inquiry commission. Regrettably, 
the incidents continued. The Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar was 
also attacked, after which the military situation exploded. We 
really regret the accusations. We also urge the stopping of 
this bleeding, this crushing war raging among the sons of the 
Yemeni people, which claims the lives of Yemen's sons. 
  [Badawi] Concerning the nature of war, Mr. Salim Salih 
Muhammad, the northern Yemenis claim that the fighting is taking 
place between the Constitutional legitimacy and the rebelling 
forces of the YSP leadership, as they put it. What is the YSP's 
viewpoint on the nature of the raging conflict? 
  [Muhammad] Are we not also part of the legitimacy? Have we 
not assumed power in light of the results of elections in the 
country? Are we not part of the Presidential Council, the 
Council of Ministers, the House of Representatives, and the 
other state institutions? We do not come from islands in the 
Pacific Ocean. We come from Yemen. We are Yemen's sons. We 
have been representatives of a state and a recognized legitimate 
power. We have achieved unity on an equal basis with our 
brothers in the north. Such claims do not render any service. 
In fact, they further exacerbate the conflict. Very 
regrettably, they also open a very deep wound in Yemeni unity 
and national unity. 
  [Badawi] The northerners' conditions for a cease-fire are 
represented by the YSP leadership's adherence to Constitutional 
legitimacy, and the submission to the legitimacy led by 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, as they say. Are you willing to accept these 
conditions? What are your conditions, as the YSP, to stop 
fighting? 
  [Muhammad] The YSP has never proposed that 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih should be finished or go, or that the existing legitimacy, 
represented by the Presidential Council, the Council of 
Ministers, the Parliament, or the other existing state 
institutions, should go. However, he who has made the war 
decision, and who is waging it now against his sons, army, and 
people, to prove that he is the strongest and the triumphant, he 
is the one who will eventually lose history and the people. 
  [Badawi] What are your conditions for a cease-fire? 
  [Muhammad] We have no conditions other than actually 
beginning to implement the pledge and accord document, to 
recognize people's rights and duties, and to build the modern 
Yemeni state. Some sides believe the military option will give 
them the upper hand over everything, and enable them to 
establish their regime the way they want, in accordance with 
their own interpretations. Such a decision, I believe, is a 
crazy decision. The Yemeni Armed Forces and Yemeni 
installations are now being destroyed. Innocent people are 
being killed, the Yemeni people in Aden, Sanaa, al-Dali', Abyan, 
Shabwah, and Dhamar. These people are the victims of this crazy 
war which will not achieve the objectives of those who ignited 
the war. 
  [Badawi] President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was quoted as saying 
that he wants to try 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his men, or to allow 
them to leave the country. What is your opinion about this? 
  [Muhammad] I have not heard such a thing. What I ask for 
now, from he who has reason and really wants to avoid further 
involvement in these crazy battles which, as I said, claim the 
lives of the sons of the Yemeni people, we ask them at this 
critical moments when the homeland is suffering from an ordeal 
and fragmentation, to stop the war immediately and resort to the 
language of dialogue, logic, and reason. 
  [Badawi] What about the dismissal decisions that affected 
senior southern officials, led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid? The 
northerners say that southern deputies participated in the 
voting sessions. Is that true? 
  [Muhammad] In your opinion, and in view of the current 
conditions, the state of emergency, and in view of the campaigns 
of physical liquidation we heard about in Sanaa, who would 
participate in such sessions? What kind of democratic, peaceful 
atmosphere would they have in a state of war? The world, the 
Arabs, and the Yemenis must understand what is going on in Yemen 
now. The situation is serious. It needs assistance from all 
our brothers and friends. 
  [Badawi] With regard to the rumors about appointing a 
successor to 'Ali Salim al-Bid and others in the central 
government in Sanaa, especially in the Presidential Council -- a 
probable candidate is rumored to be 'Ali Nasir Muhammad -- how 
do you view such reports? 
  [Muhammad] These issues are presented as bargaining chips in 
order to be used in haggling. In my opinion, the people have 
this right. The people gave their votes to their 
representatives in areas from which we came. These people have 
this right. 
  [Badawi] Now that the situation cannot be decided on the 
battlefield -- a week has passed since the outbreak of 
hostilities -- what are the chances that a return to dialogue 
will be effected and unity saved? 
  [Muhammad] There is no other way, regardless of the battles. 
The warring sides must eventually negotiate. I think that 
regardless of the harshness of the situation or the number of 
victims, we must preserve what is left and resort to the correct 
method, the method of dialogue, irrespective of differences. As 
for the war methods, regardless of their quick results, it will 
have very serious consequences in the future. It will not only 
cause wounds but will lead to a great suffering and moving the 
Yemeni people 30 to 40 years backward. 
  [Badawi] In your view, is it possible to save the unity? 
  [Muhammad] In my opinion, if the political will that was 
available when the unity was reached is still there, the answer 
is yes. However, judging by the methods that are being used in 
the battlefields and the vindictive way military personnel are 
dealing with unarmed civilians in towns and villages, deep 
wounds have been caused in national Yemeni unity. 
  [Badawi] Do you expect mediation, especially Arab mediation, 
to result in positive results, particularly in the foreseeable 
future? 
  [Muhammad] There is mediation and there are Arab efforts, 
but 
regrettably the brothers in Sanaa are rejecting all this. They 
believe the military solution is the ideal solution. This 
reading of the situation and of reality is tantamount to 
gambling. We wish them guidance from God. We wish they are 
guided to the right path. 
  [Badawi] In case Arab mediation fails, will you demand 
international intervention by the UN Security Council and the 
United Nations? 
  [Muhammad] So far, I have not been informed of any decisions 
from the brothers at home but we will consult on all 
possibilities, because everything is possible.

    [Editorial Report] Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic on 30 March 
publishes on page 5 an approximately 4,000-word report on the 
suspects charged in connection with a spate of recent explosions 
in Jordan. 
  AL-BILAD, ``an independent political weekly,'' claims to 
have 
accompanied Major Muhannad Hijazi, the public prosecutor of the 
State Security Court, and the defendants to the sites targeted 
for explosions. The defendants were reported to have been in 
good health. They were also reported to have said that they are 
``heroes'' because they carried out these bombings. The 
argument that they advanced is that they were carrying out God's 
injunction against ``debauchery.'' They reportedly planned to 
establish a caliphate, assassinate intelligence and army 
personnel, and kill the Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks 
teams to halt the march of ``capitulation,'' as they put it. 
  The weekly states that 'Abdallah Kamil al-Shuraydah 
al-Hashayikah is the principal defendant in the series of 
bombings that have recently taken place in Jordan. The weekly 
notes that al-Hashayikah, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, 
Suwaylih Branch, left Amman in 1990 to work as a teacher of 
Arabic in the Philippines, where he also taught at the al-Imam 
al-Shafi'i Foundation. This foundation is supervised by Jamal 
Khalifah, also known as Abi-Bara', a Saudi national and an 
in-law of Usamah Bin-Ladin, a Saudi national of Yemeni origin 
currently living in Khartoum, Sudan. Khalifah, Bin-Ladin's 
right hand-man, is reported to be close to the ruling Saudi 
family. 
  According to the paper, al-Hashayikah discussed with 
Khalifah 
the idea of launching of an organization in Jordan to 
``eradicate forbidden conduct by force'' in order to lay the 
groundwork for establishing a caliphate in Jordan. This idea 
was well received by Jamal Khalifah. The recruits of the 
organization would be Jordanians who received military training 
in Afghanistan during the war with the Soviets. The only thing 
the organization needed was financing. The report states that 
this all happened while the two were in the Philippines. 
Al-Hashayikah returned to Amman early this year to launch his 
organization so that he might receive the promised finances from 
Bin-Ladin, and Jamal Khalifah, ``the mastermind of Bin-Ladin's 
terrorist operations in the Arab world.'' 
  The article continues, noting that the organization 
al-Hashayikah used had already taken its final shape before he 
left for the Philippines. It had a joint command consisting of 
himself, as well as Jihad al-Tanjir, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud, 
and Isma'il al-'Amayirah. They used mosques and places of 
worship to ``concoct conspiracies.'' The recruits of the 
organization received refresher courses in military training 
during further visits to Afghanistan via Saudi Arabia or Yemen. 
  According to the paper, ``Bin-Ladin's group'' received the 
recruits in Saudi Arabia upon their arrival there, and provided 
them with the necessary visas and air tickets to Pakistan, where 
they then traveled to Afghanistan. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zandani, representative of the Yemeni Reform Grouping at the 
Yemeni Presidential Council, is reported to have provided the 
Afghan Arabs stopping over in Yemen en route to Afghanistan with 
the necessary visas and air tickets, as well as ``his constant 
financial support for the organization.'' 
  The weekly also claims that some of the organization members 
remained in Jordan to plan bomb attacks and recruit other 
members. Having faced difficulties in acquiring the necessary 
explosives in Jordan, the organization sent Zakariyah Muhammad 
Dawud Qasim to Yemen, where he was trained in how to manufacture 
sophisticated explosives. He was also trained in detonating 
explosives by remote control. 
  The paper explains that, in order to achieve its objectives, 
the organization believed that it had to kill Arab and Muslim 
leaders who do not apply the Islamic sharia in their countries. 
It also believed that it had to resist the ongoing Middle East 
peace negotiations by all means, including the use of force. 
The organization also planned to blow up movie theaters, 
nightclubs, bars, tourist areas, liquor stores, and public areas 
where the two sexes mingle, such as the Housing Bank Complex. 
The organization also planned to assassinate senior 
intelligence, army, and public security personnel in order to 
pave the way for the creation of a caliphate in Jordan. 
  Noting a plan by the organization to assassinate the 
Jordanian and Palestinian peace talks negotiators, AL-BILAD 
says: ``In addition to carrying out bombings, the organization 
members entertained the idea of drawing up a full-fledged plan 
to liquidate Jordanian and Palestinian peace negotiators, headed 
by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, former head of 
the Jordanian delegation to the peace talks.'' 
  According to the paper, the group found al-Majali's home 
telephone number, and telephoned him, telling him they were 
journalists working for a local daily. They asked for a date 
for an important press interview with him. Al-Majali agreed to 
grant them an interview. Al-Majali was meant to be assassinated 
during this bogus interview, according to the report, which it 
said was planned with a great deal of cleverness. A date was 
set for the interview and forty-eight hours before the interview 
was scheduled to take place, the organization leadership had 
drawn up a detailed plan to assassinate al-Majali by explosive 
charges and other weapons to be carried by the bogus press team, 
which would have consisted of reporters and cameramen. 
  The paper says it was only divine providence that intervened 
to save al-Majali, who was assigned an official mission outside 
Jordan. This mission required him to travel to Washington ahead 
of the time set for the implementation of the assassination 
plan. Thus, the bogus interview date was postponed to a later 
date. However, this date has never materialized because the 
culprits were apprehended. 
  The weekly paper goes on to say that, having failed in their 
bid to liquidate al-Majali, the organization members attempted 
to assassinate members of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Middle East peace talks, including Faysal al-Husayni and Hanan 
'Ashrawi. However, stringent security precautions and the 
secrecy with which al-Husayni and 'Ashrawi surround their moves 
thwarted the defendants' scheme. Undeterred by their failure, 
the defendants recruited an employee of the Grand Palace Hotel, 
where the Palestinian peace negotiators stayed. The hotel 
employee was asked to plant explosive charges in the peace 
negotiators' rooms. Once again, strict security precautions 
thwarted their scheme. 
  According to the report, the failure of the organization's 
assassination scheme prompted the organization command to 
endorse a plan of explosions in Jordan to convince Jamal 
Khalifah to finance the organization. This resulted in 
explosions at movie theaters in Amman and al-Zarqa'. However, 
attempts to carry out further explosions elsewhere in Jordan 
failed. 
  Muhammad 'Ali Shihadah is reportedly the ``organization's 
mastermind responsible for picking explosion targets.'' 
  The paper's investigations indicated that 'Abdallah Diyyah, 
a 
prominent Suwaylih-based Muslim Brotherhood member, was 
acquainted with the organization's scheme by 'Abdallah 
al-Hashayikah. However, Muslim Brotherhood sources ruled out 
Diyyah's involvement in this scheme. 
  Elaborating further on this issue, the paper says: ``Several 
quarters insinuated that the Muslim Brotherhood could be 
implicated in these explosion incidents, particularly since 
al-Hashayikah was a Brotherhood leader in Suwaylih, not to 
mention the fact that Diyyah was close to the hawkish wing of 
the Muslim Brotherhood. Meanwhile, informed sources ruled out 
this possibility, which has not been confirmed by the 
interrogations conducted with the defendants.'' 
  ``AL-BILAD has learned that 23 persons have been implicated 
in the recent spate of explosions. They will stand trial at the 
State Security Court within the next two weeks. If found 
guilty, they could receive punitive measures, including the 
death sentence. These defendants are the following: 'Abd Salih 
Husayn al-Jahalin, Muhammad 'Ali Husayn Shihadah Abu-'Ayyad, 
Yasin Hasan Muhammad Zahrah, Hasan Hamdan Hasan 'Abd-al-Qadir, 
Muhammad Salih Musa 'Aqil, Sulayman Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Al Bisah, 
Muhammad Ahmad 'Abd-al-Fattah al-'Adharibah, Samir Ahmad 
Muhammad Tilagh, 'Abd-al-Nasir Mahmud Muhammad Yunus, Fa'iq 
Salih Yusuf al-Shawish, 'Umar Jibril Muhammad al-Shawahin, 
'Abdallah Kamil al-Hashayikah, Jihad Ahmad Khalid al-Tanjir, 
Khalil Tawfiq Muhammad 'Alqam, Muhammad Ahmad al-Shaykh 
al-Fahmawi, Salim Musa Yusuf, Zakariyah Muhammad Dawud Qasim, 
Isma'il Sa'id al-'Amayirah, Muhammad Sa'id Muqbil Dar-'Awdah, 
Walid Muhammad 'Ashsha, Muhammad Amin al-Shamasinah, Ra'd 
Khalil, and 'Abd-al-Majid al-'Adharibah.'' 
  AL-BILAD concludes its report by promising to provide its 
readers with further details as they unfold when the State 
Security Court begins to investigate this case.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah in London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT </F>
bureaus in Sanaa and Aden, and Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo: 
"Yemeni Initiative To End the Fighting Between the Two Sides"] 
  [Excerpt] The leadership of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen in al-Mukalla and Aden yesterday studied an initiative 
from the Sanaa leadership offering a cease-fire in return for a 
cancellation of the declaration of a state in southern Yemen 
without any other conditions such as the conditions previously 
laid down by Sanaa about surrender and trial of what it 
described as the "mutineers" in the leadership of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  As speculations continued all day yesterday about the likely 
reaction of the southern command, observers said that the aim of 
Sanaa's initiative was to "try to block international 
recognition of the new republic which the southerners, faced 
with President 'Ali Salih's intransigence, were forced to 
declare as a last resort to save whatever they can after the 
failure to reach understanding within the context of unity." 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Salim Salih Muhammad, 
member of the Yemeni Presidential Council in the unified state 
and of the southern Presidential council; 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, 
former south Yemeni president; Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 
deputy prime minister in the unified state; and Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah, all participated in drafting the 
initiative which was promptly accepted by President Salih. A 
high-ranking source said "we are waiting to see what develops 
from that." 
  The initiative of the Yemeni figures came as all parties 
were 
trying to contain the situation by promoting a cease-fire. Some 
sources, however, have emphasized that the southern leadership 
is now laying down two conditions before it considers any move 
on its part. The first: a cease-fire on all fronts; and the 
second: the return of all the southern units now in northern 
Yemen to the south and withdrawal of all northern units that are 
now in the south to the north. 
  It is not known if Sanaa would now accept these conditions.

Naji al-Harazi in Sanaa, Nura Fakhuri and Taj-al-Din 
'Abd-al-Haqq in Abu-Dhabi, and AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureaus in Aden 
and Cairo: "Failure of the Meeting between Zayid and al-Ahmar 
Speeds Up United Arab Emirates' Official Recognition of 
Democratic Yemen; Salih Tries to Impose `Legitimacy' by 
Penetrating Hadramaut and Splitting the Socialist Party] 
  [Excerpts] The Yemeni war raged on yesterday while the 
search continued for a diplomatic solution that would determine 
the fate and future of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. 
Indications at both levels are that the Sanaa leadership is 
determined to impose what it sees as "legitimate and 
constitutional" by all means including opening a front in 
Hadramaut and trying to split the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
despite rejection by the southerners and the YSP leadership. 
[passage omitted] 
  Diplomatic sources in Abu-Dhabi have stated that the failure 
of the meeting held between Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar 
[Yemeni House of Representatives speaker, Yemeni Reform Grouping 
leader, and Hashid tribes chieftain], and [United Arab Emirates 
President] Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan might speed up 
the official recognition of the new southern state in Yemen 
because al-Ahmar's visit was "Sanaa's last card to clear the air 
with Abu-Dhabi, which has frankly held 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
responsible for the continuation of the fighting." 
  Diplomatic observers say that "nobody can succeed where 
al-Ahmar failed because of al-Ahmar's close personal 
relationship with Shaykh Zayid and his tribal weight in the 
region." Al-Ahmar's statement after the meeting reflected his 
extreme annoyance because 'Ali Salim al-Bid had been described 
as president. He said "that is a very big word, and it is an 
insult to Yemen." Despite his implicit criticism of the United 
Arab Emirates, Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar said at his press 
conference: "I do not believe that any Arab or friendly state 
would recognize the secession." 
  Al-Ahmar emphasized that resorting to military means to 
settle the issue "was the last choice in the interest of 
safeguarding Yemen's unity." He added that "Yemen does not 
reject mediation to stop the war provided it is in the context 
of legitimacy." He denied the rumors about the possibility of a 
meeting between President Salih and the southern leader 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. He said that "it would be improper to hold a 
meeting between the president and a mutineer." 
  Al-Ahmar rejected intervention by the Security Council in 
the 
Yemeni conflict. He said: "What has the Security Council to do 
with an internal issue?" But he avoided the pitfall in which 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and development minister 
and member of the General Committee (Political Bureau) of the 
General People's Congress [GPC] -- President Salih's party -- 
slipped when he accused foreign powers of aiding the mutineering 
secessionists. Shaykh 'Abdallah did not apportion any blame in 
that respect. 
  The Yemeni House of Representatives speaker denied the 
presence of any extremist forces in Yemen. He said that Sanaa 
has given the United States assurances on that and got from it 
an assurance of support for Yemeni unity. He also denied that 
former south Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad was offered 
the post of president. He said: "'Ali Nasir Muhammad is a 
patriotic leader but we do not offer posts to anyone. The way 
is open for everyone to serve the homeland." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Haydari and Faysal Makram in </F>
Sanaa and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah in Aden] 
  [Excerpts] Responsible political sources in Sanaa yesterday 
expressed their fear that Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas' visit to the United States for medical treatment is a 
political maneuver to impede the government sessions in Sanaa. 
[passage omitted] 
  Yemeni political quarters in Sanaa and Aden considered the 
sudden departure of al-'Attas, prime minister and member of the 
Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], an evasion 
from holding the Yemeni Government meetings expected to resume 
in Sanaa next Wednesday [20 April]. The cabinet held a session 
in Aden three weeks ago and in Ta'izz one week ago. 
  These quarters say that the sudden departure of al-'Attas 
for 
medical treatment in the United States arouses suspicion, 
especially since the members of his government knew nothing 
about his trip for treatment, which he began the day before 
yesterday following his meeting in Aden with U.S. Ambassador to 
Yemen Arthur Hughes. 
  Yemeni political quarters, including members of the dialogue 
committee, expressed extreme concern about what it terms as 
al-'Attas' attempt to abort the role of the Yemeni coalition 
government in implementing the accord document and to abort the 
efforts aimed at reunifying the constitutional institutions in 
Sanaa. These quarters linked al-'Attas' trip with the visit to 
Britain by Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the YSP Political 
Bureau and the Presidential Council, following his Arab tour. 
The quarters considered this an evasion on the part of the YSP 
from the commitment to reunify the institutions in Sanaa, 
particularly the Presidential Council and the Cabinet. The 
Presidential Council was expected to convene in Sanaa in the 
presence of Salim Salih Muhammad following his Arab tour, during 
which he conveyed messages from YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid to a number of Arab leaders. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni 
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, arrived in Amman yesterday at the head 
of a Yemeni delegation which includes Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah 
Muhsin, minister of housing and urban planning; Muhammad 
'Abd-al-Rahman, head of the Yemeni vice president's office; and 
a number of officials and media men to prepare for a visit by 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, who will sign the Yemeni document of pledge and 
accord in Amman on Sunday, 20 February. The document aims at 
ending the crisis in fraternal Yemen so that the brothers would 
resume their march of unity, democracy, and prosperity, God 
willing. 
  On arrival at Amman Airport, Salim Salih Muhammad made a 
press statement in which he expressed his thanks and deep 
appreciation for His Majesty King Husayn, the Jordanian 
Government, and the Jordanian people for hosting the Yemeni 
reconciliation meeting in Amman of all the Arabs. He said: We 
are pleased that Amman is the venue of this meeting which is 
awaited by the Arab nation and those who love democracy, 
especially the Yemeni people, since the document which will be 
signed in Amman is the common denominator which was agreed on by 
the Yemeni people represented by their popular and political 
parties and key figures. 
  He said that the Amman meeting will contribute to 
entrenching 
democracy, which the Yemeni community is witnessing during these 
historic moments. He noted the pan-Arab role Jordan is playing 
on all levels. 
  The delegation was received at the airport by Dr. Ma'n 
Abu-Nuwar, deputy prime minister; Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Nusur, 
minister of public works and housing; and the Yemeni ambassador 
in Amman.

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 23 (AFP)--Rival troops were on high alert 
east of the port city of Aden Wednesday, as the authorities in 
former North and South Yemen engaged in a war of words following 
clashes in which at least 20 were reported killed. 
  A spokesman for the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) 
accused troops from the north of having "extended their 
deployment beyond the Abyan region" about 100 kilometres (62 
miles) east of Aden. 
  Southern forces were preparing to "resist the armed 
aggression," the spokesman said, adding that northern forces, 
including the Republican Guard, had also been redeployed along 
the former north- south border, facing southern troops. 
  Meanwhile, Salim Salih Muhammad, a southern member of 
Yemen's 
presidential council, told the official UAE news agency WAM that 
Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid would "not go to Sanaa in the 
current security situation, before troops have been withdrawn 
from Yemeni towns." al-Bid was due back in Yemen later Wednesday. 
  The YSP said Tuesday the northern al-'Amaliqah brigade 
ambushed and killed 15 southern soldiers in Abyan, endangering a 
reconciliation agreement between north and south signed in Amman 
on Sunday. In Sanaa, officials of President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih's General People's Congress (GPC) said two soldiers were 
killed and 20 wounded on both sides. 
  On Monday seven were reported killed in clashes between 
troops from north and south. The two armies have not been 
merged since the country was unified in May 1990. 
  Salih and al-Bid signed a deal in Amman on Sunday to end a 
political crisis which has paralysed Yemen since al-Bid refused 
to take up his duties as vice-president in Sanaa in August, 
demanding major economic, political and military reforms. 
  Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah denounced 
southern 
leaders on Wednesday for visiting neighbouring Gulf states, 
saying they were trying to gain support in the crisis. 
  "The moves by southern leaders are a continuation of the 
undeclared secessionist policies practised since last August," 
Basindwah told the Kuwaiti newspaper al-Siyasah. 
  Southerner Salim Salih Muhammad rejected Basindwah's 
comments 
as "baseless" and said the officials were touring Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to explain the Amman accord 
and patch up relations which were soured by Yemen's perceived 
support for Iraq in the 1991 Gulf war. 
  Basindwah also said Yemen was keen to have good relations 
with Gulf countries "and hopes those countries will realise the 
importance of not allowing any party to drag them over to its 
side." 
  He was commenting on al-Bid's visits to Saudi Arabia and 
Oman, just after he signed the reconciliation agreement with 
Salih. 
  al-Bid, who heads the YSP, met King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for 
the first time since the end of the Gulf war. The two leaders 
appeared on television in the region shaking hands and smiling. 
  Salim Salih Muhammad travelled to Kuwait and the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE), where he briefed leaders on the Amman accord, 
brokered by King Husayn of Jordan. 
  The reconciliation accord called for constitutional reforms, 
an improvement of security and the withdrawal of military 
checkpoints from cities.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Hamud Munsir: "General </F>
People's Congress Denies Sanaa Alliance With al-Turabi 
Conference and Brotherhood"] 
  [Excerpt] London, Sanaa -- 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi, head of 
the general department in the Yemeni General People's Congress 
[GPC], has denied reports of the arrival in Sanaa of delegations 
from Arab and international Islamic movements "to discuss an 
alliance formula with the GPC led by Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG]," the 
northern partners in the ruling coalition in Yemen, in the face 
of a so-called "Egyptian alliance with the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] against extremist organizations." 
  He made this statement following information supplied to 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by well-informed sources, namely that Sanaa 
received a delegation from the West German-based Muslim 
Brotherhood's international organization based in West Germany 
and a delegation from the Khartoum-based Arab Islamic [Popular] 
Conference [AIPC] led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi. 
  The sources added that the two delegations met with 
President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and expressed willingness to support Sanaa 
in its dispute with the Aden-based YSP. 
  The sources said that the proposal for the Muslim 
Brotherhood 
international organization to cooperate with the Yemeni 
leadership "is limited to the ideological aspect" and includes 
moving the headquarters of an Islamic studies center and a 
European-based Islamic magazine to Sanaa, in addition to 
appointing Faris al-Saqqaf, member of the YRG Higher Committee, 
as the magazine's chief editor and providing expertise to 
contribute to the battle against the YSP. 
  As for the AIPC's proposal, the sources said that it 
"stresses the need to prepare for a military battle to secure a 
jihad atmosphere that helps to polarize Islamic mujahidin from 
all over the world in order to wage a war against the YSP and 
prevent it from returning to secularism." The sources added 
that AIPC representatives cited in their proposal what they 
termed "Egypt's supply of military and security experts to Aden." 
  Yemeni television's Channel 2, which transmits from Aden, 
has 
launched a media campaign against "extremism in the name of 
Islam." 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT could not get in touch with Faris 
al-Saqqaf 
yesterday evening, as he was busy with the YRG Higher Committee 
meeting. However, 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi pointed out that 
these reports "are part of the media leaks which the YSP has 
begun to use in the framework of a new shift in its media 
rhetoric to manage the Yemeni crisis." Al-'Anasi said that 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice president and secretary general of the 
YSP, and Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential 
Council and assistant secretary general of the YSP, "said 
recently that they had uncovered a political Islam plan in Yemen 
against the democratic unionist plan -- which is untrue and has 
nothing to do with political reality in Yemen." He expressed 
his amazement at the YSP's use of this card "to win the West 
over against political forces currently allied with it in 
power." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Ali Nasir Denies Alignment With </F>
'Ali Salih and Considers His Supporters' Acceptance of Posts To 
Be a Personal Decision"] 
  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The former (south) 
Yemeni President ['Ali Nasir Muhammad] has denied any connection 
with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's recent decisions in Sanaa 
appointing a new defense minister and a new naval forces 
commander, both from the military commands which had seceded 
with 'Ali Nasir from the regime which ruled south Yemen before 
the unity, in the 13 January 1986 incidents. He said that 'Ali 
Nasir is "for national unity and Yemeni unity." 
  This came in an exclusive telephone statement to AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT from his residence in Damascus, reacting to Yemeni and 
Arab claims that the appointment of Staff Brigadier General 
'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur as defense minister after Sanaa's dismissal 
of Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir, 
who belongs to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], and the 
appointment of Colonel Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Hasani as naval forces 
commander, were made in the context of a new alliance between 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Nasir to strike at the YSP in the 
south by using southern elements. 
  'Ali Nasir wondered why these speculations were made now and 
why there were no speculations about coordination between him 
and the YSP when 10 men formerly loyal to him joined the party a 
few weeks ago. Ten other supporters of 'Ali Nasir, he said, are 
members of General People's Congress [GPC] leaderships. He said 
that the GPC and the YSP had "shared power, wealth, and the band 
[al-zumrah]." 
  It is worth noting that, during the 1986 incidents, the wing 
loyal to 'Ali Nasir was called the "band" and the wing including 
the current YSP leaders was known as the "clique" [al-Tughmah]. 
The sides called each other by these names. 
  The former president said that acceptance of an appointment 
to any post in the Yemeni state is a personal decision by the 
individual concerned. "When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid joined hands against us, we dissolved our own party." He 
stressed that "'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid are 
responsible for what is taking place in Yemen." 
  He stressed that a distinction should be made between the 
position he insists upon, meaning that he "only supports Yemen's 
unity and is not aligned with any other party," and the 
positions of others "who are divided between the YSP and the GPC 
as it has become a matter of personal choice" since the latter 
part of 1989 when serious preparations began for Yemen's unity. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has also obtained a statement issued by 
'Ali Nasir saying that he is "deeply pained by what is going on 
in Yemen, the war and the infighting to the detriment of 
national unity and Yemeni unity, destroying the Yemeni people's 
achievements for which the people struggled for over 30 years." 
  He reaffirmed his support for the efforts made for the 
preservation of unity and the settlement of disputes and 
political conflicts through dialogue and peaceful means. He has 
done and continues to do everything in his power to settle the 
dispute between the two sides through a number of initiatives 
this year and last year. He had earlier warned and expressed 
fear that the differences and conflicts between the three 
members of the ruling coalition could develop into a fire that 
would burn the unity. 
  He added that "any efforts made or solutions proposed must 
be 
based on the preservation of Yemen's unity, not on a return to 
the borders which existed before 22 May 1990." 
  He also announced that he is "holding consultations with 
some 
Yemeni figures who have not been involved in the conflict with a 
view to a new initiative for the settlement of the Yemeni 
crisis."

<F P=106> [By Mahir Chmaytilli] </F>
  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 30 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni forces 
have been hampered by internal dissension and a lack of manpower 
as they struggle to thwart a northern advance along about 100 
kilometres (60 miles) of frontline around the port city of Aden. 
  Three northern tanks slipped through into the undefended 
western suburb of Madinat al-Sha'b on Saturday [25 June], the 
office of the south's appointed vice-president 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Jifri said. 
  Initially they met no resistance, giving northern forces 
enough time to consolidate their forces and cut off Aden from 
its oil refinery 18 kilometres (11 miles) to the west along the 
coast road. 
  Southern forces swiftly hurled their men towards the area in 
a bid to recapture the route to the refinery which supplies 
their troops with fuel. 
  But the north had the advantage of surprise and, turning the 
tables, launched another offensive to the north. 
  By Tuesday they had advanced as far as the city's pumping 
station about 15 kilometres (nine miles) north of the city. 
  Aden was thus effectively cut off from vital fuel and water 
supplies. 
  Southern officers collectively attribute the northern push 
to 
a lack of manpower among the soldiers loyal to southern leader 
'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  They point out that the south, which declared independence 
on 
May 21, has just three million people, compared with the north's 
population of 11 million. 
  In a bid to make up the numbers, a general call-up has been 
announced and buses tour the city collecting young men to take 
them to the front. 
  Since the war broke out on May 5 the south has been further 
handicapped by dissension among its own ranks. 
  A member of the southern presidential council, Sulayman 
Nasir 
Mas'ud, has accused soldiers loyal to the former president of 
South Yemen 'Ali Nasir Muhammad of backing the north in Abyan 
province east of Aden. 
  Muhammad, who came from Abyan, was toppled by al-Bid in a 
bloody power struggle in Aden in 1986, before the former 
conservative North Yemen merged with the Marxist South in May 
1990. 
  Al-Jifri accused units loyal to the former president 
deployed 
in the north of "treason," saying they had lent their weight to 
al- Bid's rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner. 
  The units knew the layout of the terrain in the south. 
  The south's setbacks can also be explained by the loss of 
three of their best units. They were attacked and knocked out 
of action even before the war broke out. 
  The south had tried to withdraw the units, deployed in the 
northern areas of Dhamar, 'Amran and Yarim, but the move had 
been fiercely opposed by Salih. 
  Southern leaders are also trying to combat Moslem 
fundamentalists allied to Salih. 
  About 3,000 of them are said to be hiding out in and around 
Aden, according to informed sources. 
  Southern officers have already blamed them for the fall of 
several key points, including the town of Lahij, about 30 
kilometres (18 miles) north of Aden, seized by the north three 
weeks ago. 
  Roadblocks crisscross Aden, barring the entrance to every 
district as searches go on for the Islamic militants. 
  Women militia are among 30,000 members of the Yemen 
Socialist 
Party (YSP) deployed in the city to stop any insurrection. The 
women's job is to search women wearing the Moslem veil. 
  Northern Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah has said the 
north's troops "are inside Aden itself," and Sanaa is counting 
on the population to rise up and seize the city.

interests require a cease-fire and start of dialogue. He 
renewed his call for all fraternal Yemenis to observe a 
cease-fire, end fighting, and opt for dialogue.

<F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram, Iqbal 'Abdallah, Shafiq al-Asadi, </F>
and Muhammad 'Allam: "Sanaa Confirms Advance Toward Aden; 
Southerners Repel Attacks"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa, Aden, Abu Dhabi, Cairo -- The fighting 
between northern and southern forces in Yemen -- which has 
entered its third week -- expanded and became fiercer yesterday. 
Sanaa confirmed yesterday that its forces were advancing toward 
Aden to tighten the siege around it from three directions. It 
said that the forces have now moved beyond the al-'Anad base. 
While Aden said that southern forces "have dealt crushing 
blows" to northern forces, "compelling them to retreat toward 
Kirsh" (45 km northwest of Aden). [passage omitted] 
  At the security level, a high-level military official in 
Sanaa has told AL-HAYAH that government forces (northern) are 
advancing toward Aden to tighten the military siege around the 
city from three directions: north, east, and west. Government 
forces "have now moved beyond the al-'Anad base having seized it 
and extinguished the fires caused by the rockets fired on the 
base from a 20-km distance until Wednesday night/Thursday 
morning by Socialist Party sources (southern). After combing 
al-'Anad base, government forces have begun to advance toward 
al-Hawtah, capital of Lahij Governorate, where they will join 
other forces which have advanced through al-Habilayn after 
crossing the Socialist forces' fortifications in the southern 
areas of al-Dali' Directorate, which they seized about 10 days 
ago. Meanwhile other forces advanced on this axis yesterday 
toward Aden." 
  The military official added that "government forces on the 
eastern axis are engaged in fierce fighting with Socialist 
forces in the al-'Alam area between Abyan and Aden Governorates. 
They had arrived from Zanjibar (capital of Abyan Governorate) 
from al-'Amaliqah units and other government forces backing them 
on this axis." He pointed out that "a land and air attack on 
government forces in the southeastern fringes of Abyan 
Governorate was repelled when government forces shelled Aden 
airport with rockets in the early hours of yesterday morning. 
The government (northern) Air Force launched air strikes 
against naval ships belonging to the Socialist Party, providing 
a cover for the al-'Amaliqah forces' land attack toward the 
al-'Alam area." 
  On the southeastern axis, the same source confirmed that 
northern forces "are engaged in fighting with the Socialist 
Salah-al-Din Brigade some 25 km from al-'Irqah port." Socialist 
forces on this front "have suffered heavy losses in military 
equipment, and are moving toward Aden." 
  He added that "government forces have since dawn yesterday 
been engaged in fierce fighting with the 'Abbas and Taysir 
Brigade at the approaches to 'Anaq in Shabwah Governorate." He 
confirmed that the city "is about to be captured by government 
forces." 
  Meanwhile, sources close to President Salih have confirmed 
his demand that eight Socialist Party Political Bureau leaders 
be handed over as a condition for a cease-fire, or that they 
leave the country quickly. They are 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Haydar 
al-'Attas, Salih Bin-Husaynun, Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, Haytham Qasim 
Tahir, Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad, Qasim Yahya, Salih Munsir al-Sayli, 
and Muthanna 'Askar. The president excluded from this condition 
Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant secretary general of the 
Socialist Party, and 14 other Socialist Party Political Bureau 
members, most notably Jarallah 'Umar, culture minister; Anis 
Hasan Yahya, head of the Socialist Party parliamentary bloc; 
Fadl Muhsin, fish resources minister; Muhammad Sa'id 'Abdallah, 
housing minister; and Ahmad 'Ali al-Salami, electricity minister. 
  The sources said that President Salih briefed the Arab 
League 
secretary general's two envoys when he met with them before they 
left Sanaa for Cairo three days ago. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Sa'id al-Qaysi: "Secret Network Rules North </F>
Yemen Using Saddam's Methods!"] 
  [Text] Yemen is on the threshold of war. The statement this 
time was made by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's vice-president 
in the General People's Congress [GPC], and it is considered to 
be true by all the people in power, by observers, and by Yemenis 
who are awaiting the catastrophe that is bound to happen--after 
everybody has crossed the redline and reached the point of no 
return; after the latest crisis has revealed behind-the-scenes 
activities in the regime, the contradictions of the rulers, and 
the absence of a unified authority. In this report from Sanaa, 
AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI reveals a [hitherto] unknown part of the 
background of the conflict going on in Yemen, the part that has 
played an important role in escalating this conflict and 
bringing the situation to a head. It has to do with the makeup 
of authority in Sanaa and the secret network built up by 
President Salih--or rather, which he participated in building 
up--in order to govern Yemen according to Saddam Husayn's 
methods. This is being accomplished by means of a "secret 
alliance" between the family and tribe that many people say 
rules Yemen, that is, the al-Ahmar family, and the extremist 
fundamentalist groups that have entered the arena and converted 
President Salih into their hostage, whom they threaten to expel 
any moment. It is known that southern Yemen is ruled by the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], but who really rules northern 
Yemen, and what is the role that the fundamentalist groups and 
Arab Afghans play there? 
  "Yemen is a country that is out of breath." Most of the 
people in government and observers agree with this remark. And 
there are those who are awaiting a catastrophe. This may happen 
because there no longer is anything to stop it, and everybody 
has crossed the redline. There is no authority. In the North, 
authority is in "unknown hands," as some of the educated people 
have said. 
  Talking about authority in Yemen is something that opens 
doors to a strange world that the crisis began to reveal and 
that has given it its dimensions. Everybody has come to know 
what is going on and who the bosses are--the family, the tribe, 
and the extremist fundamentalist groups. As for the corruption, 
this is a complete world unto itself, and stories concerning it 
have become regular fare at places of relaxation and 
khat-chewing rooms. "Nothing is new," according to a professor 
of sociology who has been in jail and does not care to go back 
there. 
  First there is the question of who is in charge. Who rules 
northern Yemen? The professor of sociology says: "We have a new 
royal family in the guise of a republican cover. We have the 
Bayt al-Ahmar monarchy in Yemen. Bayt al-Ahmar is one of the 
villages belonging to the Sanhan tribe located not far from the 
capital city of Sanaa. The al-Ahmar clan is considered to be one 
of the clans of the Hashid tribe which is headed by Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, head of the Yemeni Chamber of 
Deputies and head of the Higher Committee of the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping [YRG] (the political facade of the Muslim Brotherhood). 
  In northern Yemen, all power is in the hands of the al-Ahmar 
family. The village of Bayt al-Ahmar was not known until it was 
at the center of events when one of its native sons, Lt. Col. 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih al-Ahmar, took over the reins of power in 
1978 after two presidents of the republic were killed in 
mysterious circumstances; they were President Ibrahim al-Hamdi 
and President Ahmad Husayn al-Ghashmi. From that time until 
today, the al-Ahmar clan has endeavored to consolidate its power 
and influence in the government, following the pattern of Saddam 
Husayn in Iraq. 
  The important positions in the military establishment and 
the 
security apparatus are occupied by the president's brothers, 
cousins, in-laws, and uncles--in other words, by blood 
relatives--and they are followed [in the hierarchy] by the other 
members of the clan. This is true in spite of the existence of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], which has become merely a 
showcase. The head of the party and president of the republic 
does not trust anyone except individuals in his family and clan. 
For this reason, he has placed them in the most important 
military and security-related positions. 
  An examination of the rosters of the various commands of the 
armed forces in northern Yemen shows that most of the commanders 
of the brigades and units and all the management of the 
(technical, operational, and financial) offices in the armed 
forces and security apparatus are persons who are from the same 
tribal grouping, that is, Sanhan. 
  If anyone from any other tribal grouping occupies any of 
these positions, then he is at least from Hashid, the overall 
mother tribe. 
<H5>  Rule by Bayt al-Ahmar </H5>
  One notices that Bayt al-Ahmar, the birthplace of the 
president, accounts for the lion's share of the top positions, 
in fact, about 48 percent of them. Bayt al-Ahmar is then 
followed by the villages of Sayyan, Wadi Silmok, al-Jarda', and 
al-Dhanin. We find that Bayt al-Ahmar and four of its 
neighboring villages account for most of the top positions, that 
is, 22 of them, and this constitutes about 70 percent of the 
total. Consequently, we can say that many of the other villages 
inhabited by people belonging to the Sanhan clan do not enjoy 
the confidence of the president. In addition to this, no 
effective military command position is occupied by anyone from 
the Bakil tribe, which is Yemen's largest tribe that follows the 
Zaydi school of Islam, as do the Hashid tribes. Also, the areas 
of Ma'rib, Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, al-Bayda', and Ibb, whose people 
follow the Shafi'i school of Islam, have no presence in the 
power structure. 
  The following is a list of persons who occupy the top 
positions: 
  Col. Muhammad 'Abdallah Salih al-Ahmar--the president's 
brother, commander of the central security units, which are 
deployed throughout Yemen's cities. 
  Col. 'Ali Salih 'Abdallah al-Ahmar--the president's 
half-brother by his mother, commander of the Republican Guard 
which is composed of 30,000 highly-trained soldiers armed with 
various modern advanced weapons. 
  Col. Muhammad Salih 'Abdallah al-Ahmar--the president's 
half-brother by his mother, commander of the Air Force and Air 
Defense Forces. 
  Col. 'Ali Salih Ahmad Muhsin al-Ahmar--the president's 
half-brother by his mother, commander of the artillery units in 
the Governorate of Sanaa. 
  Col. Muhammad Ahmad Isma'il al-Ahmar--the president's 
brother-in-law, commander of the 8th Brigade and commander of 
the troops stationed in the east. 
  Col. Muhammad 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar--relative of the 
president, deputy commander of the air defense affairs [branch] 
of the Air Force. 
  Col. 'Ali Muhsin Salih al-Ahmar--relative of the president, 
commander of the 1st Armored Division (Sanaa). 
  Col. 'Abd-al-Malik Ahmad al-Sayyani--from the village of 
Sayyan (Sanhan), chief of the general staff. 
  Col. 'Ali Ahmad al-Sayyani--from the village of Sayyan 
(Sanhan), chief of military intelligence. 
  Col. 'Ali 'Ali al-Sayyani--from the village of Sayyan 
(Sanhan), commander of the 1st Missile Brigade. 
  The list is long, and clearly indicates what the power 
structure is. 
  However, what about the regime's activity as related to 
terrorism, a matter which many people, both inside and outside 
Yemen, are talking about? 
  "Fundamentalist terrorism," in particular, intensified 
rapidly around the end of 1991, that is, after unification, and 
it has targeted the YSP and the opposition parties. However, 
since the end of 1992, investigations have begun to reveal the 
links of the terrorist fundamentalist groups, particularly after 
the attempt to assassinate 'Ali Salih 'Abbad, nicknamed "the 
Next One" [al-muqbil], who is a member of the Political Bureau 
of the YSP, and the explosions which targeted the Aden Hotel. 
The investigation revealed that the organization responsible was 
the Islamic Jihad movement, which is considered to be the 
military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, led by Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, the strong man in the Reform Party, 
who is also a member of the Presidential Council, the highest 
body of authority in Yemen. 
<H5>  Weapons from Somalia and Sudan </H5>
  According to official information, the Reform Party 
constitutes the political facade of the Muslim Brotherhood 
movement, which has been historically linked to Egypt since the 
sixties. However, starting in 1988, the movement began to 
change. It was restructured, by means of the creation of a 
military wing, during the war in Afghanistan. A total of 100 
soldiers were sent to Afghanistan to participate in the war and 
to train, and Sanaa has become the gathering point for a number 
of young Arabs who fought with the freedom- fighters in 
Afghanistan. In Sanaa they were supplied with official papers 
and travel tickets, and the main financier of these operations 
was one of the tribal leaders. 
  After [the war in] Afghanistan, the power struggles began. 
Several groups emerged, one of which was led by Yasin 
'Abd-al-'Aziz, a Shafi'i from Ma'rib who is not a bloody type 
and is not allied with the power structure. There is also a 
group known as the "Party of Iran," since most of its members 
regularly travel to Tehran. 
  In Sanaa, the "Arab Afghans" enjoy great freedom, live in 
"villas" in wealthy residential neighborhoods such as Hiddah 
[name as transliterated], which is where 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zandani's residence is, and they have offices on Hiddah's 
main street. Usually the "Arab Afghans" engage in political 
activity in Sanaa and go there to rest before returning to their 
training camps located near the city of Sa'dah, in the far 
north, in the Ma'rib area, and in the Maraqishah mountains on 
the [former] border between the North and the South, near the 
southern Governorate of Shabwah. These camps are financed by the 
Reform Party and a wealthy Yemeni living in Khartoum whose name 
is Usamah Bin-Ladin and who is a friend of Shaykh al-Zandani. 
  Reports indicate that the terrorist groups have strong ties 
to the military commanders, especially the brigade and unit 
commanders, since the groups are transported in military 
vehicles. Some of the military commanders are directly 
responsible for some of the actions of terrorism. There is, for 
example, the officer Salih Dahmash, who is in charge of a cell 
in the southern Governorate of Abyan. He works under the command 
of Col. Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the armored division, who 
is the regime's strong man. Their weapons are transported in 
boats from Somalia and Sudan. Some of them go to the coastline 
of southern Yemen, and the rest are transported to the eastern 
coastline of Egypt on the Red Sea. 
  Official sources indicate that the fundamentalist groups 
have 
become so strong that they are threatening the regime of 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. One person close to the president says that the 
problem is a very grave one, since these groups have capitalized 
on the crisis and have contributed toward inflaming the 
situation for the purpose of undertaking a palace coup and 
replacing the president with somebody else in his family who is 
from the Hashid tribe. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice-president and 
secretary general of the YSP, says only that more than one 
Lockerbie-type of terrorist operation is being hatched in Yemen.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah in London, </F>
Naji al-Harazi and Hammud Munsir in Sanaa, 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-Sadiqi in Abu-Dhabi, Muhammad Sadiq in Washington, and 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT bureaus in Aden and Cairo: "Shaykh Zayid 
Holds Salih Responsible for the Continuation of the War"] 
  [Excerpt] As the fierce fighting intensifies between the 
northern and southern forces on the al-'Anad-Kirsh and 
al-Dali'-al-Rahidah fronts, it seems that the military 
operations launched by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
from Sanaa have reached red lines which cannot be crossed and 
that the situation now makes it necessary for the Arab and 
international powers to take a clear stand. Signs of such a 
stand have come from the United Arab Emirates [UAE] in holding 
President Salih responsible for the continuation of the war. A 
number of Yemeni leaderships have meanwhile considered a number 
of options including secession. 
  UAE diplomatic sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that UAE 
President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan frankly stated the 
UAE's position to the Yemeni president in a telephone 
conversation with him the day before yesterday, and said that he 
"regrets the Yemeni president's failure to respond to repeated 
appeals for a cease-fire." 
  The sources added that the UAE frankly stated its position 
because "it has no common borders with Yemen and no direct 
interest, and, therefore, being frank on the Yemeni conflict 
does not place any political or diplomatic burdens on it and 
would not leave room for anyone to doubt the UAE's goodwill and 
objectivity." 
  The sources hope that the UAE position will be an incentive 
for a number of other Arab states who are reluctant to declare 
"a frank position on the crisis to follow the example of the UAE 
as a way of putting pressure on Sanaa to agree to a cease-fire." 
They also said that although the UAE was the first Gulf state 
to sound the alarm, Shaykh Zayid "is still willing to make every 
sincere and true effort to contain the situation, prevent 
deterioration, and settle the dispute through dialogue in favor 
of the Yemeni people's interests and stability." 
  Shaykh Zayid emphasized that "dialogue is the only way to 
settle the Yemeni crisis. Yemen's interests must come before 
all other considerations." 
  Observers saw indications of the UAE position in the 
noticeable attention given to the visit of Salih Abu-Bakr 
Bin-Husaynun, the Yemeni oil and mineral resources minister who 
went there as an envoy of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice president 
and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], 
compared with the cool official reception accorded to Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah who went there as an envoy of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that the announcement of the 
Higher Salvation Council in Aden the day before yesterday came 
after comprehensive discussions by the leaders of the YSP and 
five other Yemeni opposition parties with the participation of 
30 House of Representatives members from the southern and 
eastern governorates. The discussions covered five main points 
relating to the current options in the Yemen arena, as follows: 
  1. Appeal to the Arab kings and presidents, the United 
Nations, and the world's parliaments to intervene to stop the 
fighting, spare Yemeni blood, and prevent fragmentation of the 
Yemeni homeland. 
  2. Announce partition and restoration of south Yemen's 
independent international identity. 
  3. Ask a committee of deputies to visit some Arab and 
foreign capitals and UN centers to inform the world of the 
deputies' support for the YSP leadership. 
  4. Draw attention to the dangers of the emergence of a 
regime that supports forces which violate Arab consensus and 
forces of extremism. 
  5. Reaffirm the importance of the southern patriotic forces' 
determination to resist the northern invasion of the southern 
governorates. 
  The YSP leadership in Aden, however, has disclosed that it 
is 
currently studying a number of political options, especially 
mobilizing national support in the north and the south for the 
preservation of the unity state, and international support 
against the "alleged legitimacy which is in fact seeking to 
destroy that unity state and destroy all chances of a better 
future for the Yemeni people." 
  A responsible source at the U.S. State Department has 
confirmed that the United States "supports the efforts of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] and the Arab League to stop the 
fighting and settle the Yemeni crisis." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Instructed by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman and supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces, Local Administration Minister 
Muhammad Hasan Dammaz continued his field inspection tours of a 
number of areas and districts in the southern governorates of 
our country which have been purged from the filth of the 
apostate and secessionist gang in the leadership of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  The local administration minister yesterday visited the 
Mukayris district in Abyan Governorate. He was welcomed on his 
arrival in Mukayris by brother Staff Colonel Muhammad Isma'il 
Ahmad, the axis staff officer; Muhammad 'Abd-Rabbuh Dahnan, 
commissioner general of the Mukayris district; a number of 
district officials; officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers from the 8th Special Forces Brigade; and a large crowd 
of citizens from the Mukayris district. 
  The brother local administration minister visited the 20th 
Brigade's camp which had been purged and recovered from the 
YSP's apostate and secessionist forces by the men of our Armed 
Forces, the gallant heroes of the Special Forces Brigade, and 
with the support of citizens supporting the constitutional 
legitimacy and Yemeni unity. 
  Brother Muhammad Hasan Dammaz toured various positions in 
the 
camp and inspected its strong fortifications, which were built 
in accordance with the most up-to-date military systems. He 
also visited several weapons stockrooms in various parts of the 
camp, which contained thousands of ammunition boxes, weapons, 
batteries, artillery pieces, and antiaircraft guns. He also 
inspected large numbers of tanks, guns, and automatic machine 
guns that have been seized from the 20th Brigade after fierce 
battles waged by our Armed Forces against the forces of 
injustice and aggression, giving the most glorious examples of 
heroism and sacrifice. [passage omitted] 
  The brother local administration minister also met in the 
same camp with the officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers of the 30th Brigade, who, together with their weapons 
and equipment, joined our Armed Forces, the forces of justice 
and defense of the constitutional legitimacy and unity.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant secretary </F>
general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, YSP, by AL-DUSTUR 
correspondent Salih al-Qallab, in Aden -- date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Al-Qallab] If some delay 
takes place in implementing the accord document after it is 
signed, will the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], which controls 
the largest part of Yemen, unilaterally implement it? 
  [Muhammad] Extensive and important discussions are being 
held 
at our leadership and cadres level and with the other parties to 
reach a clear answer to the question of what to do vis-a-vis 
this document. 
  It is very difficult to answer your question. We cannot say 
now that we will unilaterally implement the document if our 
partners in the coalition refuse to implement it. However, with 
respect to issues that need no constitutional amendments, that 
do not conflict with laws in force which are adopted by the 
legitimate authorities, I say that we have the right to 
implement them in areas where it is possible to do so. [passage 
omitted] 
  We will avoid everything that violates the Constitution, 
harms unity and could be interpreted as being part of the 
establishment of a second state. We will continue dialogue with 
all the parties concerned to achieve what one can call a white 
revolution. 
  [Al-Qallab] It is obvious that the YSP is inclined to sign 
this document outside Yemen while others believe the signing 
should take place on Yemeni soil. Why are you prefer to sign it 
abroad? 
  [Muhammad] We, in the YSP, prefer that the document be 
signed 
in Jordan for three reasons: 
  The first is that the brothers in Jordan had suggested at 
the 
start of the crisis that a meeting between the president and his 
vice president take place in Amman. Brothers 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Salim al-Bid agreed to this. [passage omitted] 
  The second reason is that, this time, we want witnesses. We 
want an Arab presence, other than the Jordanian brothers. We 
proposed that the anticipated Amman meeting be attended by 
neighboring countries. There is a direct connection, for 
example, between the issue and the brothers in Oman, in Saudi 
Arabia, and in Eritrea, not to mention Egypt, Syria, the PLO, 
and the Arab League. 
  We want these fraternal countries to be represented at a 
high 
level. Also, there are some foreign countries which from the 
beginning have shown an interest in the need to seek a solution 
for the Yemeni crisis and to safeguard Yemeni unity. These 
countries should be invited to the Amman meeting, particularly 
France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
  The third reason is that I believe that the Yemeni crisis is 
still acute, particularly concerning its military and security 
dimension. While we take the first steps, during the signing 
ceremony, we do not want to see any security breaches that might 
inflame the situation and destroy all the achievements that have 
been attained. 
  In other words, if the signing ceremony takes place in a 
Yemeni area or city, every party or group attending the meeting 
will be escorted by huge security forces. In such a case, it is 
not far-fetched that, intentionally or not, a misunderstanding 
could take place between this or that person. This would lead 
to a catstrophe because the situation and atmophere are very 
tense. Huge efforts, including those of the Jordanian brothers, 
have been made to prevent this. 
  We believe that the signing of the document in fraternal 
Jordan will guarantee the safety of all, including the brothers 
and friends who will be invited to attend. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Qallab] We have noticed that all the YSP leaders, 
including the vice president and the prime minister have moved 
from Sanaa to Aden. Is this some kind of a strong protest 
against a specific situation, for security reasons, or to avoid 
an eruption of the situation, particularly at this stage? 
  [Muhammad] There are two reasons: Security in Sanaa, 
regrettably, is not available, particularly for the leaders and 
members of our party. This is substantiated by the fact that 
many of our houses have been attacked, and we have lost several 
of our leaders and cadres in broad daylight. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Qallab] When will you return to Sanaa? 
  [Muhammad] We decided to have our brothers in the House of 
Representatives return and assume their duties. But, with 
respect to some leaders, the causes which forced them to leave 
Sanaa should first be remedied. 
  [Al-Qallab] We have heard that 'Ali Nasir Muhammad might 
return to Aden. Have matters been definitively settled with 
that wing of the YSP? 
  [Muhamma] Yes. This issue has been closed for more than two 
years now. With respect to brother 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, we have 
no objection to his return to Aden. We welcome him. 
  We have settled all differences and have closed the January 
incidents file on the basis of dialogue and alliance, and the 
formation of a broad front of all the forces, parties, and 
figures to complete the unity project.

  [Excerpts] Political parties participating in the Yemeni 
coalition government, and Yemeni party figures signed the pledge 
and accord document in Amman on 20 February under the 
sponsorship of his Majesty King Husayn. 
  Hundreds of Yemeni and Arab political figures came to Amman 
to participate in the signing ceremony and to witness it. 
  AL-AHALI covered the event and interviewed Salim Salih 
Muhammad, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and 
assistant secretary general of the Yemeni Socilaist Party [YSP]. 
[passage omitted] 
  On the series of assassinations of YSP officials, Salim 
Salih 
Muhammad said the party that carried out the assassinations is 
the Jihad organization, an organization sponsored by the Yemeni 
Reform Grouping. Some of these elements returned from 
Afghanistan and were identified. They were identified only in 
the areas where we are present, he said. We supplied all the 
information needed concerning their activities and they were 
arrested. Others are still at large in Sanaa and the tribal 
areas. Some tribes and shaykhs are protecting them, not to 
mention some influential armed forces officers. 
  Muhammad added: That's why the first point of the document 
dealt with addressing the security situation, and arresting the 
culprits and bringing them to trial. He said: We do not pass 
judgment in advance. We leave this to the courts to decide. 
  Muhammad added that the security issue is now the major 
concern of the people. One week ago, oil companies and embassies 
gave us information on terrorist operations to take place in the 
southern areas, particularly attacks against oil facilities. 
  Salim Salih Muhammad admitted that some documents show that 
this scheme and those responsible for it are connected to Usamah 
Bin-Ladin, a Saudi national who is now in Sudan. Usamah 
Bin-Ladin is known for his support for fundamentalist movements, 
particularly those returning from Afghanistan. 
  Muhammad added: I told the U.S. ambassador that you nurtured 
these terrorists and used them at a certain time to confront the 
liberation movements, nationalist regimes, and the socialist 
bloc. Now they have turned against you. 
  Muhammad said: Our stand in the YSP on terrorism is firm. We 
are against it, against exporting it, and against all the forms 
it may take, whether ideological or any other form. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Afaf Zayn] </F>
  [Excerpts] London -- As 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, 
assistant secretary general of the General People's Congress and 
Presidential Council member, was telling journalists in Sanaa 9 
May that fighting had stopped at all axes in the Abyan 
Governorate in the south of the country and that the military 
situation had been decided in favor of pro-government forces 
"poised to complete their tasks by entering Aden within 48 
hours", 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] was telling AL-WASAT on the line from his 
Aden residence that "they will enter Aden over our dead bodies." 
He was emphatic that the Army brigades in what used to be known 
as Southern Yemen before the merger "would soon shift from their 
defensive to an offensive posture," after the intensive bombing 
had failed to achieve its objectives. 
  Contradicting 'Abd-al-Ghani's contention that the fighting 
"was about to be settled in favor of the legal forces against 
the separatists in the YSP, al-Bid told AL-WASAT "the military 
situation" had not been decided in favor of the forces under the 
man (President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih) who made the insane 
decision to set off the explosion. Arab and world opinion can 
now better judge the kind of practices we have endured over the 
three and one-half years that the merger lasted. He drew a 
parallel between "the military option President Salih had been 
planning before the signing of the accord document in Amman and 
the illegal appointments and dismissals and Saddam Husayn's 
decisions following the invasion of Kwuait and his dismissal and 
replacement of the Kuwaiti government." [passage omitted] 
  With escalating hostilities, the political situation in 
Sanaa 
and Aden continues to be ambiguous. According to Salim Salih 
Muhammad, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih opted for the military 
option once he realized that under a regime of political 
pluralism following 14 years of totalitarian rule, he had lost 
many of his privileges. Driven by a tribal mentality, he put the 
fate of the country on the line, equating himself with the state 
and the army. It is this kind of mentality that destroyed the 
union. His lending his ear to certain YSP officials, who were 
closer to his way of thinking since the proclamation of unity, 
propels the "conspiracy theory". That conclusion is echoed by 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, who says: "Yes, there is a conspiracy." 
  What does this conspiracy seek to achieve? Al-Bid replies 
that the aim is to set up in the region a theocratic entity 
built on the alliance between the military and the fundamenalist 
establishments. "It is the military fundamentalist state of 
Sudan, along the lines of which other such regimes are being 
planned," asserts al-Bid. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq: Salim Salih: Some Yemeni </F>
Forces Support Military Option; Experience Taught Us Signing 
Does Not Mean Anything"] 
  [Text] Abu Dhabi -- Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant 
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and member 
of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has cast doubt on the 
possibilities of implementing the Yemeni Pledge and Accord 
Document signed in Amman last Sunday. And he warned of the 
threat of civil war. 
  The Yemeni official said at a press conference in Abu Dhabi 
following his meeting with Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, 
president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE], that "the document 
will not see the light of day in practice except in the areas 
which fall under YSP influence." He also said that Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid will not go to Sanaa except after 
the implementation of the document begins. 
  The Yemeni Presidential Council member -- who visited the 
UAE 
in the framework of a tour designed to explain the horizons of 
the Yemeni crisis after the signing of the Pledge and Accord 
Document -- added that "there are those who are helping to 
bolster military action and military option tendencies and to 
turn the tables on all parties." He praised Shaykh Zayid 
Bin-Sultan's understanding of conditions in Yemen. He said that 
"without securing a new mechanism to implement this document, it 
will remain in the drawer." He broached the experiment of the 
past four years, saying that "it has caused us to believe that 
signing is not the important step, but, rather, implementation 
and starting implementation." 
  He described the incidents which have occurred over the past 
two days in Abyan Governorate as "designed to torpedo the Yemeni 
people's prospects after the signing of the document." He said 
that "the document is not a medical prescription to remedy the 
Yemeni crisis. The crisis needs mutual and united efforts from 
all political parties and from all sincere people who want to 
spare Yemen a civil war and the road of violence, terrorism, and 
fragmentation." 
  Salim Salih Muhammad stressed that "'Ali Salim al-Bid, YSP 
secretary general and vice president, will not go to Sanaa under 
the present security situation unless this situation is resolved 
and armed troops are withdrawn from the cities and unless 
credibility regarding what has been agreed upon is proved." 
  Asked whether that means that the document is merely ink on 
paper, the Yemeni official said: "It will be so if it remains 
in the drawer, if the situation remains as it stands, and if the 
Armed Forces and security forces continue to detonate the 
situation here and there." 
  He stressed that the document "will not see the light of day 
in practice except in the areas which fall under YSP influence." 
  Asked about the benefit of signing the document when the 
disputes are still there, Salim Salih said that "the signing is 
binding on all parties, and it exposes any parties that refuse 
to implement the document. At then the people will know who 
does not want to implement it." 
  He added: "It is clear that there are those who are helping 
to bolster the military action and military option tendencies. 
They want to turn the table on all the parties. This is what 
we want the brothers, friends, and the Yemeni people to be aware 
of." 
  Salim Salih Muhammad accused "some military commanders and 
other forces of supporting this tendency." He said that "the 
testimonies of those arrested pointed to the existence of these 
forces, which help, support, and sometimes embrace elements 
which have returned from Afghanistan and elements accused of 
carrying out bombing operations and assassinations and recently 
abducting three Chinese engineers." 
  On the nature of the disagreements which emerged in Amman 
after the signing of the document and prevented the return of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
to Sanaa, accompanied by King Husayn of Jordan, Salim Salih 
Muhammad pointed out that "what was agreed upon in Amman is only 
what is mentioned in the published document. However, there 
were some issues which needed to be discussed. But regrettably, 
the brothers in some parties, including the General People's 
Congress and the Reform Grouping, did not give us the 
opportunity to do so." He added that the YSP submitted a 
working paper about what should be done after the signing, "but 
they refused even to read it." 
  Salim Salih Muhammad urged all parties on the Yemeni scene 
to 
take account of current changes and to work together to spare 
the Yemeni people the threat of civil war and fragmentation, 
secure whatever guarantees stability and development, and 
implement the various political, economic, and social plans. 
  He stressed that the YSP leadership is working to bolster 
Yemeni unity; it is not seeking separation. However, he warned 
that "unless matters are resolved fairly and rights are returned 
to their claimants, and unless local government is implemented, 
powers allocated, and a clear relationship between Sanaa and the 
other governorates and regions secured, we will find ourselves 
in a different position. What we fear is for Yemen to turn into 
more than one part, not just north and south, as was the 
situation in the past. Because changes have imposed on us new 
realities in relations and in understanding people." 
  On his visit to Kuwait -- the first by a Yemeni official 
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 -- Salim 
Salih described this visit as "a good start in the framework of 
establishing normal relations between the two countries." He 
also said that "for our part, we presented our view to normalize 
relations between the two countries." 
  He expressed his hope that Kuwait will transcend the deep 
wound with regard to Yemen's official positions during the Gulf 
war. he said, "we as brothers should transcend the past and 
look to the future." 
  He stressed that current conditions in the region, including 
the efforts to secure a solution to the Palestinian issue and 
the Arab-Israeli conflict, require the achievement of a degree 
of Arab solidarity. He expected Kuwait to embark in the period 
ahead on steps toward normalizing its relations with a number of 
states. He described the results of 'Ali Salim al-Bid's visits 
to Egypt and Syria as good, saying they have achieved their 
results at all levels.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- The impact of the ongoing 
battles between North and South Yemen has reached the Yemeni 
Embassy in Cairo. Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah issued a decree relieving Yemen's Ambassador in Cairo 
'Abd-al-Jalil Ghilan, a southerner, of his post and recalling 
him to Sanaa, appointing Ambassador 'Abd-al-Malik Sa'id, a 
northerner, in his place. 
  Ghilan closed the embassy's electronic doors this morning, 
prevented staff from entering to assume their duties, and took 
refuge in his residence on the upper floor of the embassy 
building. The employees assembled in front of the building, 
causing a traffic jam on Amin al-Rafi'i Street in the al-Misahah 
area of al-Dukki. A police force imposed tight security around 
the embassy. 
  A security source has stated that the goal of these security 
measures is to protect the embassy against storming operations 
or riots. 
  Muhammad Fayid, a diplomatic attache at the embassy, told 
MENA that work was supposed to be resumed in the embassy this 
morning according to official instructions, which granted 
employees a four-day holiday for 'Id al-Adha. But he was 
surprised to find the embassy closed. 
  Fayid said he learned that former Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil 
Ghilan, who, as he put it, was recalled by President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, grabbed the embassy keys from the inside guard 
and threw him out. Hence, he added, the embassy staff and 
diplomats were unable to enter to perform their duties and 
render services to the members of the Yemeni community in Egypt 
or to the Egyptians. 
  Fayid commended the Egyptian efforts to resolve the Yemeni 
crisis and President Mubarak's appeal for a cease-fire. He said 
that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih responded to that 
appeal and accepted a cease-fire. But the southern leaders' 
decision to break away led the situation to explode, he said. 
He denied a separation of North and South Yemen, describing 
events as "a mutiny" by a group of renegades and affirming that 
the entire Yemeni people support unity. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Southern officials mounted a 
diplomatic drive on Tuesday in the Gulf, after troop clashes at 
home which claimed at least eight lives despite a reconciliation 
accord between Yemen's rival leaders. 
  Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, met King 
Fahd 
in the Saudi capital, while his deputy Salim Salih Muhammad met 
the Kuwaiti amir, Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, and called for ties 
to be restored. 
  They were the first such high-level visits since the 1991 
Gulf war, when the conservative monarchies accused Yemen of 
siding with Iraq and Kuwait broke off relations. 
  Al-Bid later travelled to Oman while Salih Muhammad went to 
the United Arab Emirates, where he said the tour was aimed at 
drumming up support for Yemen after the reconciliation signed on 
Sunday in Amman by al-Bid and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a 
northerner. 
  Referring to the clashes which have erupted since the deal, 
the envoy called on "all parties concerned to help remedy the 
situation and allow the return of stability." 
  But an Arab diplomat here, declining to be named, warned 
that 
the al-Bid initiative could back-fire and "aggravate the crisis 
of confidence between the president and his deputy." 
  Al-Bid is still refusing to return to Sanaa from his 
southern 
base of Aden, where he has taken refuge since last August, an 
official in the president's General People's Congress (GPC) said. 
  He said the vice president was demanding the arrest and 
trial 
of those responsible for the series of political assassinations 
since the country united in May 1990, most of which have 
targeted al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP). 
  Since Friday, fighting between rival Yemeni troops has 
killed 
at least eight soldiers and created an "explosive" situation 
which could run out of control, diplomatic and defence ministry 
sources said. 
  Seven died in two separate clashes in the south on Monday, 
the day after the Amman accord calling for major economic, 
political and military reforms. Another soldier was killed in 
fighting near Aden airport on Friday. 
  The accord on decentralization, as demanded by the south, 
was 
aimed at ending a political crisis between Salih and al-Bid that 
threatened the unity of the country. 
  Despite unity, the two armies have not merged -- although 
northern units have been sent south and vice versa -- and 
tension has grown with troop build-ups along the former frontier. 
  The situation has become "explosive," with a risk of the 
fighting spreading across the country, a source close to Defence 
Minister Haytham Tahir Qasim, a southerner, said after the 
latest clashes. 
  Four soldiers were killed and 20 wounded in the town of 
Lawdar, 100 kilometres (60 miles) northeast of Aden on Monday, 
diplomatic sources said. 
  Southern troops dispatched as reinforcements from the port 
of 
al-Mukallah fought for several hours with a northern brigade in 
a battle involving tanks and artillery. 
  Three other soldiers died Monday when northern forces 
attacked an administrative building held by southern troops in 
Zinjibar, 30 kilometres (20 miles) east of Aden, and the capital 
of Abyan province, the sources said. 
  Tension flared in Abyan after the president overturned the 
nomination of a local governor by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al- 'Attas, a southerner. 
  A military commission was dispatched to Abyan to sort out 
the 
dispute between the rival forces but so far the mission has been 
a failure, the YSP said. 
  But the GPC official played down reports of tension, saying 
the situation in Abyan was calm after the commission's 
intervention with the backing of the US and French embassies. 
  "The alarming reports from the YSP are designed to 
camouflage 
the actions they are taking that are contrary to the 
reconciliation accord," he charged.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah, Lutfi Shatarah, Hammud </F>
Munsir, and Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Southern Forces Prepare To 
Launch Revenge Attack After 100 People Are Killed in 'Imran 
Fighting"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Sanaa, Damascus -- Military 
confrontations between northern and southern forces in Yemen 
entered a serious stage yesterday after more than 100 people 
were killed from the two sides, among them 20 civilians, and 200 
wounded, and after forces moved from northern and southern camps 
and set up posts in the areas adjacent to their camps. A state 
of maximum alert has been announced among southern forces in 
Aden, including the air force, in what has been described as 
preparation for launching a revenge attack within 24 hours. 
  The security situation has become more serious following the 
attempt in Sanaa to assassinate Dr. Hasan Makki, first deputy 
prime minister and member of the General People Congress [GPC] 
General Secretariat (political bureau). [passage omitted] 
  At the military level, Yemeni sources said that the 
continuing tank battles between northern and southern forces in 
'Imran, north of the capital, Sanaa, presage an expansion of the 
fighting to all Yemeni governorates, especially as military 
reports confirmed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that the forces 
present in all northern and southern camps in the former fringes 
area have moved from their barracks and set up posts in the 
areas adjacent to their camps. 
  Authoritative sources in Aden have said that all camps in 
the 
city, including the air force, are on maximum alert. 
  The sources expect southern forces to launch a revenge 
attack 
within the coming 24 hours on northern forces in some southern 
governorates. The sources accused Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih of "wanting to eliminate the southern brigades 
stationed in the north. So it is difficult to return the 
northern forces based in the south peacefully." [passage 
omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday former South 
Yemen President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad urged the political 
leadership and conflicting Yemeni parties to take steps to 
quickly contain the crisis and stop the explosion which could 
lead to disastrous consequences. He said: The political 
leadership must stop evading the crushing crisis Yemen is 
experiencing. 
  He also said: The fighting that broke out among comrades in 
arms is unjustifiable, because there can be no victors in this 
fighting. 
  President 'Ali Nasir appealed to the Armed Forces "not to 
aim 
their weapons against one another, in order to spare blood and 
keep the Armed Forces strong and coherent so they can protect 
and safeguard the homeland." He urged all parties to adhere to 
the Pledge and Accord Document. 
  Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad stressed that the 
solution to this crisis should be Yemeni and that others' task 
should be to help only. President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad revealed 
an initiative he submitted recently to President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, saying that this 
initiative can form a prelude to a dialogue and breakthrough in 
the Yemeni situation. 
  The former president praised Arab efforts, especially those 
being made by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and some other 
Arab brothers. He said: Everyone in Yemen is responsible for 
this conflict; no one can be cleared. And they must rescue 
Yemen and the Yemeni people.

  [Text] [Announcer] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the 
Yemeni Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], accompanied by Dr. 
'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the YSP Political Bureau and 
secretary of foreign relations, arrived in Amman today on a 
two-day visit to Jordan during which they will meet with His 
Majesty King Husayn and senior officials. The visit comes 
within the framework of their tour of the region. 
  Upon arrival at Amman Civil Airport, Salim Salih Muhammad, 
member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, spoke to reporters 
about his visit Jordan. He said: 
  [Muhammad] First, we carry the greetings of the Yemeni 
people and of their political leadership and parties to His 
Majesty King Husayn and the fraternal Jordanian people. We also 
carry our great appreciation for the efforts exerted by our 
Jordanian brothers and by His Majesty King Husayn, including 
both the efforts that preceded the signing of the accord 
document and the efforts that followed, represented by the great 
role played by fraternal Jordan within the military committee, 
as well as its political efforts aimed at solving the existing 
political crisis. 
  Our current tour comes within the framework of efforts 
to inform our brothers in Jordan and the Arab brothers of the 
nature of the present situation. It also comes within the 
framework of a request for help, especially from fraternal 
Jordan, to overcome problems and certain difficulties we are 
facing. We specifically ask fraternal Jordan to continue this 
role because, in our view, it is a role that does not concern 
the Yemenis alone, but concerns all Arabs. It is an honorable 
pan-Arab role. 
  We reiterate our thanks to fraternal Jordan, to His 
Majesty King Husayn, and to the Jordanian Government. 
  [Announcer] On Yemeni efforts to implement the Yemeni accord 
document, Salim Salih Muhammad said: 
  [Muhammad] The dialogue is still going on. What is 
important to us now is to obstruct the military course -- a 
course that is frightening to us -- and to reinforce the other 
course -- the course of dialogue -- in order to begin 
implementing this document that sets the practical and sound 
solutions to correct the Yemeni situation. Moreover, it is now 
important to us to build the new Yemen, which secures rights and 
duties for all its people. 
  [Announcer] On the presence of other Arab mediation efforts. 
He said: 
  [Muhammad] We do not view mediation efforts as separate 
efforts but as concentrated Arab efforts. Therefore, we welcome 
all our Arab brothers' support for the ongoing efforts inside 
Yemen. At the same time, we particularly welcome the Arab 
efforts represented by the roles played by the two fraternal 
countries, Jordan and Oman. 
  [Announcer] On the practical steps that should be taken in 
order to overcome the crisis in Yemen, Salim Salih Muhammad said: 
  [Muhammad] At the Amman meeting held in this good land 
during the holy month of Ramadan, certain issues were defined in 
terms of beginning to implement the provisions of the accord 
document, starting with the security issue, which worries the 
Yemenis and really needs immediate implementation in order to 
bring things back to normal in Yemen. Afterward, we will get 
into the priorities according to a fixed timetable. This is the 
normal course in order to get the crisis and Yemen out of the 
dark tunnel.

<F P=106> [Fax interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant </F>
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) and member 
of the Aden Presidential Council, in London; by an unidentified 
AL-SHIRA' correspondent in Beirut; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-SHIRA'] Was your presence and that of other 
south Yemeni leaders abroad when the war broke out a coincidence 
or was it planned? 
  [Muhammad] I was on a mission to brief Arab presidents and 
kings on the other side's preparations for war and to appeal to 
them to intervene to prevent it. The other party, however, went 
ahead with its preparations and the war broke out while I was 
receiving medical treatment in London. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] What were your expectations before going abroad? 
How do you view the military situation now? What areas are 
under 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's control and what areas remain in 
your hands? 
  [Muhammad] When Yemeni unity was peacefully and 
democratically attained, certain influential circles in Sanaa 
were not happy with the way it was brought about. So they 
created difficulties and challenges from the first day, 
including assassinations, the abolishing of the new state's 
institutions, involvement in the Gulf war, undermining the 
economy, and finally making the decision to begin the current 
war. There is now fighting in Ta'izz, Lahij, Abyan, Shabwah, 
and Ma'rib. The two capital cities are subjected to missile 
attacks and air raids. The northerners are losing thousands of 
troops and hundreds of tanks and other vehicles for every small 
advance they make into al-'Anad Base or Abyan. No matter how 
many areas 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih controls, the logic of force and 
its consequences are unacceptable. The outcome of occupation 
and invasion will be overturned sooner or later. An examination 
of Yemeni history will illustrate this point. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Are you preparing yourselves for a war of 
attrition? Where are you getting the weapons? 
  [Muhammad] We did not begin the war. We do not want war at 
all. The area that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is now invading fought 
off the British Empire, the Turks, and the Portuguese. It has 
been a graveyard for invaders. There is strong resistance 
despite the ferocity of the battles. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Are you afraid Aden will turn into another 
Sarajevo? 
  [Muhammad] Although our army is much smaller and our areas 
are less populous than the north, the heroic steadfastness of 
our warriors has upset their numerical superiority. Aden's 
quicksand and mighty waves will drown the forces they are 
massing to attack the city. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Why has the oil not been attacked yet? 
  [Muhammad] We respect the investments and interests of 
others. We have the capability to hit Ma'rib and al-Hudaydah but 
we wish to protect the Yemeni people's interests and other 
people's interests. The other side, however, has struck at these 
interests by hitting Aden's refineries and is trying to approach 
and control the oil installations in Shabwah. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Was there no alternative to your separation? 
  [Muhammad] What other response do you expect from people who 
find war, destruction, and death imposed on them? What other 
option is there? 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Don't you think that giving up power for the 
sake 
of unity is a worthwhile sacrifice? 
  [Muhammad] We were idealists and gave up power for the sake 
of unity. We accepted a two-way and even a three-way 
partnership and believed that this idealism would find a 
favorable response. The bitter facts proved that the other side 
wished to dominate us, abolish our rights, and monopolize 
everything. We discovered that the unity we had dreamed of was 
not realized in substance or form. We will leave this to 
political analysts to judge later and decide which side wanted 
unity and which side is actually separatist. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] Have you been using the tactic of luring the 
northerners to the south to prolong the war and sap their 
capabilities for a political purpose? Are you trying to get 
Arab-international intervention that will formalize the current 
status? 
  [Muhammad] The next few days will answer this question. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] What is the actual U.S. position on the issue? 
Is it true that coordination between you and the United States 
began when [Yemeni Socialist Party Secretary General] 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid visited the United States and met with U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore? 
  [Muhammad] We hope that the U.S. attitude will be consistent 
with the U.S. position on the new world order and its views on 
democracy, human rights, renunciation of violence and terrorism, 
rejection of military dictatorship, and respect for all nations' 
mutual economic interests on an equal basis. The Sanaa party 
does not respect these principles, judging by its atrocious 
conduct before and during the war. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] How do you assess the roles played by the Arab 
countries? 
  [Muhammad] There is no effective Arab role. It has been 
paralyzed since the Gulf war. The Egyptian, Saudi, Syrian, and 
Emirian appeals to end the fighting are welcome but what we 
actually need is a firm Arab position to end the war and make 
the two parties accept dialogue to reach solutions satisfactory 
to both sides. As to the Iraqi position on the issue, the 
statement issued by the National Command [of the Iraqi Arab 
Ba'th Socialist Party] and the attitudes shown by their 
representatives at the Arab League demonstrates Iraq's position. 
Iraqi officials are also making visits and sending Republican 
Guard experts and experts in other fields to the north. We used 
to believe that Iraq was concerned with improving its poor 
economic conditions instead of meddling in other people's 
affairs but it appears that the militarist mentality that ruined 
many of our Arab countries is now shared by the Iraqi regime and 
the Sanaa regime. 
  [AL-SHIRA'] When will the Arabs and the world recognize you? 
Why has this recognition been delayed? 
  [Muhammad] Arab and international circles acknowledge that 
there are two Yemens. Recognition that we are two equal parties 
exists. How else would you explain the referral of this issue 
to the Arab League and the UN Security Council? The 
representatives of south Yemen were accorded the same level of 
reception as the representatives of the north.

<F P=106> [Report by Sulayman Nimr and Muhammad 'Allam: "Sanaa Accepts </F>
Arab Mediation, With Conditions"] 
  [Excerpts] Riyadh, Sanaa, Aden, Cairo -- The war between 
Yemen's two armies turned yesterday into a war of positions, 
despite the statements issued by the two sides, which are both 
claiming advances. Independent sources say that the fighting is 
now taking place in Abyan Governorate and on the fringes of 
Lahij Governorate. Efforts to resolve the crisis have now moved 
to the political level as a result of the military deadlock, as 
Sanaa has for the first time openly announced its acceptance of 
Arab mediation, "provided it is based on respect for 
constitutional legitimacy." 
  Latest reports received from the Yemeni capital said that 
fierce fighting is taking place in al-'Anad, some 50 km from 
Aden. 
  In the framework of political moves, Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni House of 
Representatives, and Development and Planning Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani arrived in Riyadh yesterday, while 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah went to Cairo. The 
Arab League has announced its willingness to send a delegation 
to Sanaa. 
  Al-Iryani told AL-HAYAH that his country is not turning down 
any Arab mediation to stop the ongoing fighting in Yemen. He 
said that "Sanaa is not turning down Arab mediation, but it 
rejects any military intervention or the dispatch of Arab 
disengagement forces." He pointed out that "an acceptable 
mediation must recognize existing constitutional legitimacy in 
Yemen" -- a reference to the necessity to recognize President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's leadership of unified Yemen. Asked 
whether the Yemeni leadership is willing to engage in a dialogue 
with the Yemeni Socialist Party leadership in south Yemen, Dr. 
al-Iryani said: "We are willing to engage in a dialogue with 
them, provided they recognize constitutional legitimacy, 
existing constitutional institutions, and a unified command for 
the Yemeni Army." 
  He pointed out that "the current problem lies in the 
existence of two commands for the Yemeni Army, hence two armies 
in one country." He said that "the ruling leadership in Yemen 
has no objection to an Arab mediation with the other party to 
the Yemeni crisis, but within the framework of recognizing the 
legitimacy of the current ruling executive authority, which was 
elected in accordance with constitutional foundations in the 
country." On the dismissal of Prime Minister Dr. Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, Dr. al-Iryani said that the prime minister 
has not been dismissed. He has been suspended in accordance 
with Article 111 of the Constitution. He pointed out that 
"dismissing the government or its head requires legislative 
measures in the House of Representatives, and the legislature, 
the House of Representatives, has -- as a result of current 
conditions -- authorized the executive authority to take 
appropriate measures to deter the separatists." 
  He reemphasized that the "legitimate and constitutional 
leadership in Sanaa is willing to engage in a dialogue with the 
other side and to make contacts with it. But we want that side 
-- before anything else -- to recognize the existence of a 
unified leadership for Yemen and the Yemeni Army." 
  He denied that his statement means a change in the position 
of the Yemeni leadership in Sanaa, as it -- through President 
'Ali Salih -- had turned down Arab mediation. He said that his 
government agreed to receive an Arab League delegation, "which 
is on its way to Sanaa" to hold talks with the legitimate and 
constitutional leadership. He pointed out that the rejection 
was of a mediation and dialogue based on the existence of two 
legitimate leaderships in the country. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the YSP Political 
Bureau, has said that referring the Yemeni crisis to the 
Security Council is now left to the states concerned and their 
assessment of the deteriorating situation and its threat to 
world security. He pointed out that "military operations have 
negated the belief that the crisis is an internal affair." 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH in Cairo yesterday, al-Dali urged 
the Gulf states "to intervene to secure a cease-fire in Yemen," 
and the brothers in the north "to return to the negotiating 
table." He accused Arab states of sending elements to fight 
alongside northern forces. 
  Al-Dali, who, because of military operations, has been 
forced 
to stay in Cairo, welcomed the call by President Mubarak and his 
Yemeni opposite number, Salih, to halt haphazard attacks on 
innocent civilians. He stated that the YSP will refer the 
matter to international and human rights organizations. He said 
that "the YSP has informed Arab states of the attacks on 
innocent civilians, urging their leaders to intervene." He 
added that "northern forces have shelled villages and civilians 
in al-Dali' area with Howitzers." He stressed that "the YSP 
will not keep silent. It will refer the matter to the 
international community and international human rights 
organizations." 
  Al-Dali urged the brothers in the north "to stop the 
bloodshed and return to the negotiating table." He also urged 
Arab and Gulf states to play a role in ending the crisis. He 
said: "As the fighting is still continuing, mediation has not 
been overtaken by events. The Gulf states still have a role to 
play." He stressed that "with the breakout of fighting, the 
issue is no longer an internal affair." Foreign influences on 
military operations "negate the belief that the crisis is purely 
a Yemeni affair." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The brothers President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the [Yemeni] Presidential Council, and Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad held a closed meeting at the People's 
Palace in Damascus this evening. 
  The Yemeni News Agency, SABA' has learned that the talks 
addressed the strong fraternal bilateral ties, the means of 
promoting them, issues of common interest to the two fraternal 
countries, and Arab issues. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman briefed his 
brother 
His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad on developments in our 
country in light of the accord document and the efforts made to 
contain the crisis and ensure the convening of meetings by the 
Constitutional institutions to help implement the accord 
document. 
  The session of Yemeni-Syrian talks was held at the People's 
Palace at 1730, Damascus time, today. The talks were cochaired 
by brothers Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of 
the Presidential Council, and His Excellency President Hafiz 
al-Asad of the Syrian Arab Republic. 
  During this session of talks, the two leaders reviewed 
current Arab developments and issues of interest to our Arab 
nation, foremost among which are developments in the Palestine 
question and the efforts under way to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region on the basis of regaining Arab 
rights. 
  The two leaders stressed the need to promote efforts to 
clear 
the Arab atmosphere and restore Arab solidarity so Arabs can 
cope with the enormous challenges facing our Arab nation, and so 
just, comprehensive, and durable peace can be achieved in the 
region. Issues pertaining to the fraternal bilateral ties were 
also addressed. 
  His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad of the Syrian Arab 
Republic has reiterated Syria's support for our people, and for 
our country's stability. He also emphasized that Syria supports 
all efforts to safeguard Yemeni unity and enhance its march, 
given that Yemeni unity is a significant pan-Arab accomplishment 
along the path of Arab unity, and a gain that is dear to all 
Arabs. He asserted that Yemen's security, stability, and safety 
concern Syria and all the sons of the Arab nation, given that 
the pan-Arab security is an indivisible whole. 
  For his part, the brother president expressed his 
appreciation of the fraternal efforts and stands of the 
fraternal Syrians, as manifested in their support for the march 
of unity and democracy in our country. He indicated that the 
Yemeni-Syrian ties are fraternal and strong. 
  At the outset of this session of talks, His Excellency 
President Hafiz al-Asad welcomed the brother Presidential 
Council chairman and the delegation accompanying him on this 
visit. He noted the strong and deep fraternal ties binding the 
two fraternal peoples. He expressed his confidence that this 
visit will reinforce these strong ties in the interest of the 
two fraternal peoples and the Arab nation.

Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi, Minister of Planning and 
Development Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Foreign Affairs 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, Presidential Council Office 
Chief 'Ali Muhammad al-Anisi, and Yemeni Ambassador to Syria

  [Text] Cairo, 26 May (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received the credentials 
of Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, Yemen's new delegate to the 
Arab League, succeeding Ambassador Ahmad al-Shajni, who died 
recently. 
  Ambassador Luqman stated that he and the Arab League 
secretary general discussed several issues concerning ways to 
resolve the Yemeni crisis and said that the Arab League has 
resumed its mediation efforts to resolve the crisis. He noted 
that efforts are being made quietly to resolve the crisis within 
the context of the Yemeni Constitution. He said: In Sanaa we 
look at the situation from the viewpoint that a state exists and 
there are legitimate constitutional institutions chosen by the 
entire Yemeni people. Hence no party has the right to declare 
secession. 
  He described the current war in Yemen as one between the 
legitimate government and separatist rebel forces. 
  Asked about Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
readiness 
for dialogue with the Aden leaders, Luqman said Sanaa has never 
stopped the dialogue, which continued throughout 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid's stay in Aden. He called for resorting to legitimacy 
and constitutional institutions. 
  Ambassador Ahmad Muhammad Luqman, Yemen's new permanent 
delegate to the Arab League, was born in al-Hudaydah in 1948 and 
began his political career as deputy minister of social affairs 
from 1976-1980. He then became minister of state and secretary 
general of the Higher Council of Youths and Sports from 
1981-1983, minister of municipalities and housing from 
1983-1988, and minister of insurance and social affairs from 
1990-1993.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with former South Yemeni President 'Ali </F>
Nasir Muhammad, by Hasan Sabra; place and date not--first three 
paragraphs are AL-SHIRA' introduction] 
  [Text] Former [South] Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
warns of the perils of the ongoing war in Yemen, asserting that 
the "Yemeni states" that the ongoing war threatens to create 
pose a threat to the entire region. 
  In a telephone interview with AL-SHIRA', the former Yemeni 
president asserted that the crisis will be resolved through 
dialogue only and noted that the "entire Gulf is for Yemen's 
unity and for a peaceful solution to the problem." 
  Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad pointed out that there 
are taboos in the ongoing war, saying that "whoever approaches 
the oil fields commits suicide" and that "it is difficult to 
establish a fundamentalist regime in Yemen." Following is the 
text of the interview: 
  [Sabra] What is your information on the progress of the war? 
Will it turn into a war of attrition and of positions? Is there 
a possibility of resolving it? 
  [Muhammad] What is going on now is attrition of Yemen's 
military and material resources. The balance of power is what 
will determine the course of the war on the ground. 
  [Sabra] There is talk now about a salvation government in 
the 
southern part of the country. Do you think that the return of 
each part to its previous borders is projected as a solution? 
  [Muhammad] In principle, I am opposed to separation. I was 
the first to sign the 1972 unity accord. My name has been tied 
to numerous unity accords, to a united Yemen, and to some other 
accords. I am opposed to secession. 
  [Sabra] How are matters proceeding now? 
  [Muhammad] The issue is no longer an issue of separation of 
North from South or of returning to the pre-1990 condition. 
  [Sabra] There is repeated talk about mini-states. 
  [Muhammad] Yes, Yemen may break up. 
  [Sabra] Hadhramaut may become a state, for example, Ta'izz a 
state, and Aden a state? 
  [Muhammad] Yes, more than one state may come into existence 
and they may become a source of concern for the entire region 
because of the strategic position Yemen occupies in the Red Sea, 
the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, the Horn of Africa, and the 
Arab Peninsula. 
  [Sabra] If there is danger from this war to the countries 
adjacent to Yemen, then can these countries intervene and is it 
possible that the entire issue will seem to be an invitation to 
the neighboring countries to intervene? 
  [Muhammad] My information is that the neighboring countries 
have declared their support for unity and that they are for 
resolving the problem [peacefully]. GCC [Gulf Cooperation 
Council] statements, the statements of Saudi sources in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and of all the other countries support 
a peaceful solution to the problem. I haven't personally heard 
of any plans for intervention. 
  [Sabra] Christopher has said that there are some countries 
that help the South and others that help the North and that 
weapons from neighboring countries are being amassed by the 
Southerners and the Northerners. What do these statements mean? 
  [Muhammad] I know nothing specific about this issue. If the 
Americans have learned of this matter, then I don't have 
adequate information on the accumulation of weapons on both 
sides. 
  [Sabra] Pelletreau [U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state 
for Near Eastern Affairs] arrived in Muscat in this period 
during which war is flaring in Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] I believe that his visit to Muscat came as a part 
of a tour of the region. He also visited Yemen, Muscat, the UAE 
[United Arab Emirates], Doha, and Bahrain. 
  [Sabra] Accidentally or what? 
  [Muhammad] I don't think that Pelletreau planned the tour to 
coincide with the battles in Yemen. He happened to be in the 
region on the first day in which the battles erupted. 
  [Sabra] Do you think that the war broke out because the 
south 
wants to return to the pre-1990 condition and because the north 
wants to control both parts of Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] In fact, I am opposed to the names North and 
South. 
  [Sabra] Well then, let us call them the YSP [Yemeni 
Socialist 
Party] in the South and the GPC [General Peoples Congress] in 
the North. 
  [Muhammad] The problem isn't a problem of North and South. 
We 
are now a single people in Yemen. We can talk about the dispute 
between the YSP and the GPC. 
<H5>  They All Use Excuses </H5>
  [Sabra] What does the YSP want of the war? 
  [Muhammad] They all use the Pledge and Accord Document as an 
excuse. They all emphasize the issue of implementing the 
Document. The YSP puts the emphasis on implementing the Pledge 
and Accord Document. 
  [Sabra] But what has happened is the opposite. 
  [Muhammad] In one of my interviews with AL-SHIRA', I said 
that the Pledge and Accord Document needs institutions to 
implement it. I said that if the institutions, such as the 
Presidential Council, the Cabinet, and the House of 
Representatives don't agree, the alternative will be anarchy, 
tension, and war. 
  [Sabra] It seems that agreement has turned into a devouring 
act. 
  [Muhammad] What we are interested in is agreement, harmony, 
understanding, and dialogue. 
  [Sabra] Is there still a chance of understanding and 
dialogue? 
  [Muhammad] The door of dialogue is always open, and it can 
never be shut. 
  [Sabra] Even if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih reaches the gates of 
Aden and occupies it? 
  [Muhammad] The door of dialogue remains open. People fight 
and then engage in dialogue. 
  [Sabra] When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih occupies Aden, what 
dialogue will there be? 
  [Muhammad] I embrace the principle and I mean that the door 
of dialogue remains open. I am not talking of who will occupy 
what 
  [Sabra] Dialogue is possible if there is equality between 
the 
two sides. But if the situation turns into a situation where 
there is a victor and a vanquished, then there will be 
capitulation, not dialogue. 
  [Muhammad] One statement I have heard is that they haven't 
closed the door of dialogue with the YSP. In his latest 
statement, which I have heard through the media and on 
television, the House of Representatives speaker said that he 
will not close the door of dialogue with the YSP. 
  [Sabra] But words change completely when one of the two 
parties is fighting at the gates of the other party's capital. 
In this instance, the language of dialogue is suspended and the 
language of bone-crushing begins. So, is there a possibility of 
dialogue? 
  [Muhammad] I still stress the principle of dialogue. There 
can be no solution without dialogue, even under the canopy of 
war. 
  [Sabra] This is true. But who will conduct the dialogue? 
  [Muhammad] Didn't you have war and conflicts in Lebanon and 
wasn't there dialogue afterwards? 
  [Sabra] Yes, but Syria entered Lebanon and conducted 
dialogue 
among the parties concerned after separating the combatants and 
ending the war. Do you think that there is an Arab country that 
can lead the dialogue in Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] In Yemen, Arab countries and the Arab League can 
help the country overcome this crisis through dialogue, because 
intervention will not help resolve the crisis. 
  [Sabra] What is the mechanism for Arab intervention? An Arab 
League delegation arrived in Yemen and stayed there for four 
days, but 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih didn't receive it. Salih didn't 
answer Egyptian President Husni Mubarak for four full days. 
  [Muhammad] But he did receive the delegation recently. 
  [Sabra] He received it on Husni Mubarak's insistence. It 
took 
him four days to answer Mubarak's telephone call! This means 
that he rejects any dialogue and any intervention by another 
party. In your opinion, can an Arab country, such as Egypt, 
Syria, or Saudi Arabia, conduct dialogue between the two sides 
after putting a halt to the war first? 
  [Muhammad] Efforts by Egypt and Syria and, as I have already 
pointed out, by the countries which contributed initially, such 
as Amman [Jordan] and Oman, are needed. 
  [Sabra] How about the United States and France who have 
their 
observers? 
  [Muhammad] And the UAE and the Arab League as well. 
  [Sabra] And what about Saudi Arabia? 
  [Muhammad] I urged the brothers in the GCC at an early phase 
to cooperate and help Yemen contain the crisis, because Yemen 
and the Arab Peninsula are like one body. If a part of the body 
is ailing, the rest of the body rallies to help it. 
  This is why I urge the brothers in the GCC to take any 
initiative to halt the war, to conduct dialogue, and to impose a 
peaceful solution. I have heard that they are eager to do so. 
<H5>  Opposed to Arab Forces in Yemen </H5>
  [Sabra] You have constantly opposed the presence of an Arab 
army to separate the combatants because Yemen is a single 
country and, therefore, there is no need for an Arab army. Do 
you still hold to your opinion? 
  [Muhammad] By God, I do. President Mubarak has said: we 
cannot be a policeman to separate the combatants. The Egyptians 
have asserted that they are not for the intervention of forces 
to separate the combatants. I still hold to my opinion because 
the problem will not be solved by Arab forces but by dialogue. 
The efforts of the Arab League committee can help. 
  [Sabra] When do you think the Arab countries will intervene? 
  [Muhammad] I have learned that the Arab League delegation 
returning from Sanaa has asserted that the door of dialogue has 
been reopened. 
  [Sabra] But this delegation was a military delegation, 
headed 
by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, former commander of the Syrian 
forces in Lebanon. What I mean is that this delegation has no 
political dimension. 
  [Muhammad] I have learned from reliable sources that Yemen 
has emphasized its willingness to receive a delegation from the 
Arab League and from the Arab countries. 
  [Sabra] Under the shadow of guns? 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi has 
stated that in all battles, dialogue takes place on the 
peripheries. It is dialogue under the canopy of war and guns. 
  [Muhammad] We went through this experience in the 1972 war, 
the 1979 war, and the 1981 war. There were battles and there was 
dialogue [simultaneously]. 
  [Sabra] Could the war last another month? 
  [Muhammad] In my experience as prime minister, there were 
wars with Sanaa. Through dialogue, we settled our problems and 
contained the crisis. 
  [Sabra] At the time, you were two states. Now, you are a 
single state in which one of the two sides excludes dialogue. It 
is the opinion of this side that the other side is a group of 
outlaws, not another state. 
  [Muhammad] We were two states, and yet we engaged in 
dialogue. Now, there is a coalition government that includes all 
sides. 
  [Sabra] Have you asked President Hafiz al-Asad to intervene 
in the Yemen issue? 
  [Muhammad] I haven't asked President al-Asad to intervene 
because Syria took the initiative on its own. Through telephone 
calls with President Salih and Vice President al-Bid and with 
the delegations dispatched to Damascus, President al-Asad has 
asserted that Syria is keen on Yemen's unity and on a peaceful 
resolution of the problems. 
  [Sabra] Is there a mechanism to activate this assertion and 
turn it into a reality? Do you imagine that Syria would send an 
army to Yemen to separate the combatants? 
  [Muhammad] This question should be addressed to the Syrians. 
  [Sabra] Could you, as a [former] Yemeni official and a 
Yemeni 
conscience, ask Syria to send forces to separate the combatants? 
  [Muhammad] I couldn't make such a request officially. But by 
virtue of my friendship, I have urged the Syrian brothers to 
redouble their efforts to contain the crisis, not to dispatch 
forces. I cannot really talk about this issue. 
<H5>  My Supporters Here and There </H5>
  [Sabra] What does the presence of Brigadier General 
'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur, who is one of your supporters, as defense 
minister mean? 
  [Muhammad] It means that he is the defense minister. 
  [Sabra] What does it mean to you? Were you consulted or is 
his appointment meant to please you and to solicit your 
participation? 
  [Muhammad] Brother 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur is a YSP Permanent 
Committee member. He is well known as my supporter, and I don't 
deny this. He is also a certified military capability in Yemen. 
  [Sabra] Was he selected on agreement with you? 
  [Muhammad] You know that during the honeymoon between the 
GPC 
and YSP in 1989 and after my departure from Sanaa to Damascus, 
there was, regrettably, a division... 
  [Sabra] Of power and weapons. 
  [Muhammad] And wealth and the clique. In the past, the 
brothers in Aden used to call my faction the "clique." 
  [Sabra] And you called them the "band." 
  [Muhammad] This is why I say they divided power, wealth, and 
the clique. 
  [Sabra] They ruined everything when they imitated 
al-Qadhdhafi... 
  [Muhammad] When some brothers, including 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur 
and Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Husayni, who was appointed navy commander 
recently, joined the GPC, other brothers joined the YSP, 
including Amin Hasan Yahya, 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Qadir, and 
Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad, who are the latest to join the YSP. 
  [Sabra] Is this a Yemeni tactic? 
  [Muhammad] I have nothing to do with the way in which the 
brothers have shared the clique. I left it up to the colleagues 
to make their own choice, letting each select the party it 
wishes to join because political action is subsidiary action. 
  [Sabra] There are those who believe that when 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih settles the situation in the South finally and isolates 
the YSP, he will enlist your help so you will become the 
alternative. 
  [Muhammad] I am not interested in power. What interests me 
is 
a studies center. 
  [Sabra] You need a country to establish a studies center. 
Will there continue to be a Yemen so there can be a center? 
  [Muhammad] I am certain that Yemen will remain united, that 
the capital will be Sanaa, and that the center will be in Sanaa. 
But as to when the time to inaugurate the center will come, this 
is something that I will leave for the future. 
<H5>  Except Oil </H5>
  [Sabra] If the oil fields are exposed to danger, do you 
think 
the Americans will intervene, either directly or indirectly? 
  [Muhammad] I don't believe the brothers will play with fire 
in this region. 
  [Sabra] Will these battles spare the oil fields? 
  [Muhammad] It isn't permitted to get close to the oil 
fields. 
  [Sabra] And if they do? 
  [Muhammad] It isn't permitted. Moreover, this oil doesn't 
belong to the Americans. It belongs to the Yemeni people. 
  [Sabra] This is true theoretically. But practically, the 
Americans are the party that will benefit form the oil. 
  [Muhammad] The fires will not burn the Americans and [their] 
firms but the Yemeni people's interests and wealth. 
  [Sabra] Will the United States intervene to protect the 
Yemeni people's interests or its interests? 
  [Muhammad] I don't believe that the fires will get close to 
the oil fields. The battles that have taken place so far haven't 
affected the wells or the companies operating there. 
  [Sabra] If one of the two sides senses that it will lose the 
war, is it possible that this side could use the oil card to 
blackmail, pressure, or ambush other countries to intervene? 
  [Muhammad] It is my assessment that whoever does such a 
thing 
will commit suicide and will meet his end. Whoever thinks of 
such a thing is a madman who doesn't deserve respect and doesn't 
deserve to live in Yemen. 
  [Sabra] What is the solution to the current situation in 
Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] God knows. 
  [Sabra] It seems that you aren't pleased with the conditions 
in Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] And neither are you. 
  [Sabra] When I first called you, you expressed your 
willingness to speak as if you possessed new given facts. 
  [Muhammad] All the statements are conflicting statements 
now. 
I believe that what is going on in Yemen now is a crime against 
the Yemeni people. 
  [Sabra] How do you explain the emergence of 'Abdallah 
al-Ahmar with such prominence in the past two days? 
  [Muhammad] He is one of the coalition leaders. 
  [Sabra] His statements have been so overwhelming they make 
it 
sound as if he is the actual ruler in Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] I don't think so. He is one of the parties to the 
ruling coalition. 
  [Sabra] Salim Salih says that Yemen is approaching a 
fundamentalist regime. 
  [Muhammad] It is difficult for me to confirm this. I don't 
believe that the fundamentalists can gain power. Anyway, the 
religious tendency is a participant in the coalition, with the 
GPC and YSP. 
  [Sabra] It is also a participant in the conflict. 
  [Muhammad] Yes. 
  [Sabra] Do Salim Salih's statements sort of incite the 
United 
States and the neighboring countries against the fundamentalists 
and scare them with the fundamentalist presence in Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] I have heard no such statements. 
  [Sabra] He made them this evening. 
  [Muhammad] It could be some sort of propaganda warfare. 
  [Sabra] May God protect Yemen from what is more dangerous. 
  [Muhammad] We appreciate your concern for Yemen and your 
followup on the situation there. 
  [Sabra] We have supported Yemen's unity enthusiastically. 
  [Muhammad] We are torn by the news we hear. My heart aches 
for Yemen because this issue concerns unity of the entire Arab 
nation. We appreciate your interest in and your followup on 
Yemen. We hope that problems will be solved, that the wounds 
will heal, and that we will meet soon. 
  [Sabra] God willing.
