   The Soviets hope to develop an atomic-powered
rocket engine to provide the propulsion for a manned mission to
Mars early in the 21th century, a Russian scientist said Thursday.
   Vasiliy I. Moroz of the Soviet Space Research Institute said
experts in his nation believe that ``a new type of rocket'' will
have to be developed to make a planned 1{-year voyage to and from
Mars.
   Moroz said Soviet engineers are working on an
``atomic-electric'' rocket engine that would be used to accelerate
a Mars explorer craft once it has been boosted into Earth orbit.
   The Soviet scientist, speaking at a news conference at the 20th
general assembly of the International Astronomical Union, declined
to give any details on the atomic-electric rocket, but he said none
of the current chemical rockets used by the Soviets is large enough
for a Mars mission.
   Included in the Soviet fleet of launch rockets is the Energia,
the world's largest, but Moroz said even it is not powerful enough.
   American space scientists long have recognized the need to
develop propulsion systems that did not depend upon the chemical
reaction of fuel and oxidizer. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has conducted some research on electric and ion
drive rockets, but the project has never been received money for
development.
   Moroz said the Soviets are giving the exploration of Mars a high
priority. Two Soviets probes to Phobos, a moon of Mars, were
launched last month.
   In 1994, he said, the Soviets will send an unmanned craft to
Mars carrying a robot rover that would explore hundreds of miles on
the planet's surface. The rover also would take drill samples and
measurements of the atmosphere.
   The next stage of the program, Moroz said, is testing in space
new technical elements needed for a manned mission, including the
atomic-electric rocket and a rocket to return to orbit from the
Mars surface. The Soviets also plan a robot craft that would land
on Mars, collect soil samples and then return them to Earth.
   A manned Martian mission could be mounted by the year 2005 or
2010, Moroz said. Preliminary plans call for a six-member crew to
make the voyage in a two-stage craft that would be assembled in
Earth orbit, he said.
   Although the Soviets have gathered a great amount of information
about the de-conditioning effects on the human body of longterm
space flight, Moroz said the Mars mission may use artificial
gravity to keep the crew members healthy.
   Both American and Soviet studies have shown that long exposure
to the weightlessness of space causes the heart to weaken and the
body to lose bone mass.
   Moroz said the Soviets hope that American scientists and
astronauts will take part in the Mars mission, but even without
U.S. participation, the Soviets are determined to explore the red
planet.
   Mars has been only partially explored by the American Viking
spacecraft, he said, adding: ``It is our impression that it is time
to return to Mars.''
   Soviet scientists want to search for traces of liquid water on
the Martian surface and still hold out hope that there may be life,
even though Viking found no traces, Moroz said.
   ``You can't give guarantees that life in some form doesn't exist
there now, despite the negative findings of Viking,'' he said.

<HL> Ride Urges NASA
To Examine Earth
And Explore Mars

   Astronaut Sally Ride, warning that the U.S. has relinquished its leadership in space in crucial areas, urged a detailed examination of the Earth from orbit and the human exploration of Mars early in the next century. 

   Ms. Ride's long-awaited report represents the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's latest effort to get the beleaguered U.S. space program back on track following last year's Challenger accident. 
The space shuttle catastrophe made NASA's "shortcomings starkly apparent," said Ms. Ride, who will leave the space agency next month to take a post at a California think tank. 

   The report to James Fletcher, administrator of NASA, said that while the U.S. pioneered exploration of Mars using unmanned spacecraft, no American spacecraft has visited the planet since 1976. 
By contrast, the Soviets have announced an extensive exploration program using robots. 

   The U.S. also is far behind the Soviets in inhabiting "low-earth orbit" space stations; while the U.S. hasn't had a space station since Skylab was vacated in 1974, the Soviets have had eight space stations in orbit since the mid-1970s, the report said. 

   In mapping a blueprint for the revitalization of the U.S. space effort, Ms. Ride studied four options: 

   --"Mission to Planet Earth," which would use satellites in low-earth orbit, an orbit as far as 350 miles from the Earth, to examine the earth's atmosphere, ocean topography and vegetation. 

   --Exploration of the solar system, which would send unmanned spacecraft to a comet, Saturn and Mars for detailed study. 

   --"Moon Output," which would call for a return to the moon by the year 2000, leading eventually to a permanent lunar base for research and observation. 

   --"Humans to Mars," which would aim at landing Americans on Mars early in the 21st century. 

   Ms. Ride, in evaluating the options, didn't give the space agency explicit advice on how to proceed. 
But she did suggest that the most constructive strategy would be to focus initially on the Earth-observation program, while making plans to return to the moon and eventually to visit Mars. 
At the same time, she urged the agency to "solidly support" unmanned planetary exploration through the next decade. 

   Ms. Ride didn't provide cost estimates, but said such programs will have to stay within the fiscal constraints that NASA will face in coming years. 

   While acknowledging that exploring and settling Mars "should be the ultimate objectives of human exploration," Ms. Ride warned against a "rush headlong toward Mars." 
She added, "We should adopt a strategy to continue an orderly expansion outward from the earth." 

   Ms. Ride's report may displease those who have urged NASA to adopt, with great fanfare, the human inhabitation of Mars as the space agency's next big goal. 
Some believe that only such a glamorous, high-profile project can recapture the public's interest in the space program. 

   But others have argued that the space agency should follow a more gradual approach to future exploration. 
In her report, Ms. Ride seemed to endorse the latter by calling for "a strategy of evolution and natural progression."

as the engineers say, a metaphor.;    "You can put on goggles and feel what
it's like to be there," said Michael McGreevy, 41, the principal engineer in
the Human Interface Research Branch at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Ames facility. "Is it as good as really going there? Hell,
no. But it's better than not going at all.";    Unlike flat computer screens,
virtual reality presents information in the way humans are used to getting it
-- interactively and all around them. As a sensor tracks head and hand
movements, a computer adjusts the scene on miniature computer screens mounted
in goggles that resemble scuba masks.;    "When you put on the head-mounted
display, you get the impression the panorama is wrapped around in space, just
as if you were really there in a three-dimensional world," said Lewis
Hitchner, McGreevy's partner.;    American researchers are developing
applications ranging from virtual walk-throughs of architectural plans to the
design of new planes to video games and simulated sex. In Japan, where virtual
reality is known as "tele-existence," a government-industry partnership is
exploring the technology for super-teleconferencing.;    McGreevy and Hitchner
want to use virtual reality to democratize planetary exploration. If they get
their way, the half-dozen adventurous astronauts chosen to blast off for Mars
will be accompanied by hundreds of geologists able to wander around Mars in a
"virtual environment.";    McGreevy, who has led the research team with a
shoestring budget since 1984, hopes his project will be included in next
year's Mars Observer mission. The orbiting spacecraft, which will take about
nine months to get to Mars, will use lasers to map every meter of the surface
of the planet. Feeding the data into a virtual reality system could give
researchers their first chance to "explore" the whole planet in detail.;   
Robots as camera carriers;  Ultimately, McGreevy dreams of a room-size virtual
reality facility in which scientists at Mission Control or at a manned Mars
base could personally interact with the terrain through robotic rovers
equipped with cameras, mechanical arms and other devices.;    Wearing goggles
and wired with sensors, geologists would wander around the virtual environment
looking under virtual outcroppings and picking up virtual rock samples in the
same way they would conduct field research on Earth. Their activities would
send signals to the rover, which would carry out the tasks on Mars.;    That
would be a huge advance over McGreevy's first virtual environment. As a
16-year-old on vacation in Paris, he snapped photographs of the Eiffel Tower.
At home, he pasted the pictures to the inside of a sphere and put his head
inside.;    Wraparound photos;  "Suddenly, I had this overwhelming feeling
that I was there," he said.;    Now, McGreevy and Hitchner can pick any
coordinate on Mars and load it up for exploration in less than 20 minutes. Of
course their simulation is only as accurate as the available data, which at
present are plot-points spaced one kilometer apart, gathered by the 1972
Mariner 9 expedition.;    That's enough for breathtaking stationary views from
vista points such as the one overlooking Valles Marineris, named after the
expedition that discovered it, and for less-detailed views while "flying.";   
"Would I like to get out and hike?" McGreevy said. "Sure. We're working on it."  </TEXT>

   A Soviet space official says Moscow may push
back the planned launch date of an unmanned mission to Mars to
incorporate improved technology in both the spacecraft and the
robotic rover that will retrieve samples of the red planet.
   Genrich A. Avanesov of the Space Research Institute of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, told a space conference Tuesday that it may be
in the Soviets' interest to put off the planned 1994 mission for
about two years.
   ``Technically we do have the possibility to send a mission by
1994 with a Martian rover, but we're not sure it's worth doing,''
Avanesov said after a presentation to the conference on space
automation and robotics. ``It may be worth doing a more intellectual
mission later.''
   Asked whether funding for the mission was a problem, he said:
``Money is a problem today for us, too.''
   Avanesov emphasized that no official decision has been made on
the timing of the mission.
   Rescheduling the mission would enable the Soviets to use findings
of a U.S. mission to Mars that is planned for 1993. On that mission,
an unmanned probe called the Mars Observer is to take photographs of
Mars' surface while orbiting the planet for about two years.
   The Soviet mission will send a robotic rover to explore the red
planet's surface and return samples of its soil and atmosphere to
Earth.
   Experts in both countries have agreed that unmanned missions to
probe the surface of Mars will be necessary before a manned mission
can be launched, but it will take several years to develop the
necessary automation and robotics.
   ``No research breakthroughs seem to be required, but a great deal
of applied research and technology development and demonstration
will be needed,'' Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said in a paper presented to the conference.
   A Martian rover will need to be able to avoid hazards on the
planet's surface when it lands, negotiate the terrain, preserve soil
and atmospheric samples, and rendezvous with its launcher, he said.
   ``We see that the rover should be an intellectual one,'' with
sophisticated automation, Avanesov said. ``The question of the
autonomy is a very serious one ... and should be specially
considered.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is considering
a second unmanned mission to the planet to follow the Mars Observer,
Aaron Cohen, director of NASA's Johnson Space Center, told the
conference.
   He said a mission could be launched in 1998 to land a robotic
rover on the surface of Mars, gather samples of soil, rock and
atmosphere, and return the samples to Earth in 2001.
   ``The delivery and return phases ... offer many technical and
engineering challenges,'' he said. ``It taxes our automation
capabilities.''
   Soviet plans to explore Mars, culminating with a manned mission
around 2010 to 2015, are the top priority of Moscow's space program,
Avanesov said, adding: ``We think this Mars project will give us
broad opportunity for international cooperation.''
   His paper to the conference said the United States and Soviet
Union could work together on certain aspects of a Mars program,
including organization of a joint ground-based network of data
reception, joint data interpretation, creation of a joint data bank
on the Martian atmosphere and other exchanges of information.
   Soviet and NASA officials have met twice this year in Washington
to exchange information. They also are making plans to fly American
instruments on future Soviet missions and Soviet instruments on
future U.S. flights.

   Robby, a $1 million robot rover vehicle
designed to explore Mars, successfully picked its way along a rocky
dry river bed without human help, NASA said.
   ``This is the first time that an autonomous vehicle has ever
navigated rugged terrain using video cameras,'' said Roger Bedard,
planetary rover program manager at the space agency's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``Robby himself wouldn't go to Mars. He's a
test vehicle.''
   NASA called the Sept. 13 test ``a significant milestone'' in
developing a planet-roving, computer-guided vehicle that would
explore Mars to find suitable landing sites for a manned mission to
the red planet.
   It will be about 1995 before engineers fully develop rover
technology, and about 2000 before one can be built to go to Mars,
Bedard said Wednesday.
   During the test, Robby took four hours, 20 minutes to crawl
along a 109-yard course in the rugged Arroyo Seco, a dry river bed
in a canyon next to the laboratory. NASA wants a real Mars rover to
travel about 13 miles daily.
   Bedard said engineers told Robby where it was and where it was
supposed to go, but the six-wheeled vehicle used its twin
television cameras and computer to navigate a safe course around
boulders and other obstacles. Other tests were conducted last week.
   Robby is about 15 feet long, 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall. It was
named after Robby the Robot in ``Forbidden Planet,'' a 1956 science
fiction film.
   The robot's television cameras give it stereoscopic vision,
allowing it a three-dimensional look at objects about 6{ feet in
front of it. Robby moves about 6{ feet at a time, then stops to
survey another 6{-foot stretch of terrain before proceeding.
   Robby runs on a battery recharged by an onboard gasoline
generator. A Mars rover would be powered by the radioactive decay
of plutonium, Bedard said.
   The only unmanned rovers to explore another planet were two
Soviet Lunakod vehicles that explored the moon in the early 1970s,
Bedard said. NASA astronauts used a manned vehicle on the moon.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration doesn't yet
have specific plans to put rovers on Mars, Bedard said. The Soviets
are considering using rovers and terrain-hopping balloons during a
1994 mission to Mars.
   During the past week, 30-foot-tall balloons that would
repeatedly rise and settle on Mars' surface were tested in
California's desert by engineers from France, the Soviet Union and
the Planetary Society, a group that advocates space exploration.
   Balloons have the advantage of not needing to navigate rough
terrain, rising during the heat of day and settling to the Martian
surface at night to take measurements.
   Bedard said rovers can be directed to explore areas of
scientific interest, rather than taking a route that depends on
prevailing winds.

   WASHINGTON -- A National Academy of Sciences report
proposed that the U.S. and the Soviet Union work closely
together to explore Mars with robots.
   Eugene Levy, who headed the academy report, said he
envisioned a $10 billion project in which the U.S. launched
three "excursions" that would land robotic rovers on Mars as
early as the year 2000, dig for soil samples and return them
to Earth. The U.S. would also set up a series of robotic
weather and seismic stations on Mars. The Soviet Union, he
said, would be expected to launch three similar missions of
its own.

   Exploring Mars has long been the dream of planetary
scientists and government space officials world-wide. But
there is a sharp difference of opinion over whether
astronauts must be part of this exploration. Astronauts have
abilities to explore that machines can't begin to match, but
astronauts drive the costs to mind-numbing levels. For
instance, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
estimates the cost of setting up a manned base on the Moon
and sending astronauts to Mars early next century at about
$500 billion in 1991 dollars.
   Any manned exploration of Mars would be preceded by
robots. But Mr. Levy, head of the University of Arizona's
planetary science department, said that robotic missions
should be judged independently. "The overall social and
technological benefits of a robotic Mars exploration are so
large it would be a mistake to forgo them," he said.
   Robotic missions would require exceptionally sophisticated
machinery, computers and communications. NASA now is
experimenting with vehicles that use wheels or legs to cross
rough terrain, and have sufficient intelligence to avoid
areas they can't traverse. Mars is so distant that
controllers wouldn't be able to steer the vehicles from
Earth.
   The academy report said that robotic exploration could
best be accomplished by closely planning separate missions
with the Soviets. That way each country's robots could
explore different areas and the findings would be shared,
reducing the overall cost and expanding the scientific return
for both sides. Europe, Canada and Japan also would probably
participate, the report said, but on teams controlled by the
U.S. and the Soviet Union.
   The report recommended against a joint project with the
Soviets, however, in which the Soviets probably would develop
rockets and the U.S. would make the robots. A cooling of
political relations between the countries could doom the
project before it was completed, the report warned. A joint
mission would also deny each participant the ability to fully
develop new technologies, the report said, and lead to
worries about transferring valuable technology to a potential
adversary.
   The Bush administration has said it would begin talks with
the Soviet Union and other countries about cooperating in the
exploration of the Moon and Mars, but hasn't said what
structure it prefers.
   Mark Craig, NASA's director of exploration, said he
favored closely related, but separate missions with the
Soviets. "You date before you get married," he said.
   Returning samples from Mars could help settle questions of
whether life ever existed on Mars, and why Mars and Earth
evolved so differently. Scientists have long pondered what's
known as the "Goldilocks paradox" of planetary evolution:
Mars turned out too cold, Venus too hot and Earth just right
for life to develop.
   NASA now is debating which of several unmanned planetary
missions to ask Congress to approve for the year beginning
Oct. 1, 1996, including possible missions to Mercury and
Pluto.

   NASA is laying the groundwork to send the next
generation of astronauts beyond the Earth's orbit early in the 21st
century, with missions to Mars and a space station on a Martian moon
among the possibilities.
   In a report released Monday, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said the nation must make a ``modest investment of
resources'' during the 1990s to prepare the nation for a range of
opportunities in space.
   ``This ability is critical to United States leadership in
space,'' said the report titled, ``Beyond Earth's Boundaries: Human
Exploration of the Solar System in the 21st Century.''
   The report examined several strategies for exploring the inner
reaches of the solar system, including establishing a manned lunar
observatory, setting up a space station on the Martian moon Phobos
or sending astronauts to the red planet itself early in the next
century.
   The ambitious blueprint addresses President Reagan's directive on
space policy issued last January. The directive sets as a long-range
goal ``to expand human presence and activity beyond Earth orbit into
the solar system.''
   Frank Martin, assistant administrator of NASA's Office of
Exploration, said ``there's every indication'' the Bush
administration will support that policy.
   The underpinnings of any strategy to send space explorers to the
moon and beyond in the next two decades will be increased NASA
funding for development of new technology, life sciences research,
unmanned robotic missions, development of a new fleet of launch
vehicles able to lift heavier loads, and continued commitment to
Space Station Freedom, which is planned for Earth orbit in the
mid-1990s.
   If those conditions are met, the United States could send
astronauts to Phobos in 2003 or to Mars in 2007 or establish by 2005
a lunar base from which astronauts could build a Mars outpost in
2015, said John Aaron, who headed the Office of Exploration during
production of the report.
   Aaron said the agency has not developed reliable cost estimates
for the missions studied in the report. ``We are not talking about
missions that are cheap,'' he said, but ``we think these are
affordable.''
   Martin said such missions probably could be accomplished at less
real cost than the Apollo program, which put U.S. astronauts on the
moon in 1969. At its height, the Apollo program cost about 4 percent
of the federal budget annually, which in today's dollars would be
about $25 billion, he said.
   ``You can't do the civil space program on the cheap,'' he said,
noting the nation now spends about $11 billion annually on NASA
programs. The fiscal 1989 federal budget is about $1.1 trillion.
   ``We're not a poor nation. We can figure out how to do these
things if they're important to us,'' he said, adding that
international cooperation could help support these missions.
   Martin said NASA must leap many technological hurdles before it
can accomplish the goal of establishing a permanent human presence
in space, but ``I don't see any show stoppers there.''
   NASA's Project Pathfinder, under whose umbrella much of the
research will be done, gets $40 million this year and the same
amount next year, despite NASA's request for $100 million. Martin
said annual funding for the program must increase to $100 million
soon.
   The report focused on four case studies for sending astronauts to
the moon, Phobos and Mars. One scenario would send astronauts to
Phobos and then on to Mars; another would launch astronauts directly
to Mars; a third would establish a manned observatory on the far
side of the moon; and a fourth would use an outpost on the moon as a
stepping stone to Mars.
   Aaron, who is now special assistant to the director at Johnson
Space Center, emphasized that the four case studies are not proposed
missions, but rather vehicles for assessing exploration techniques
and validating assumptions.
   A key finding, Aaron said, is that a mission to Phobos could
significantly offset the scale and uncertainties of a direct mission
to Mars.
   An Earth-to-Mars mission would require many new technologies,
including advanced propulsion and braking systems, and would require
advanced operations such as in-orbit assembly, long-term storage and
in-orbit transfer of propellant. Much work in the life sciences also
would be needed, and because the mission would last more than 14
months artificial gravity might be needed to maintain the health of
the crew, the report said.
   Phobos is believed to be an asteroid ``captured'' by Mars'
gravity and is thought to contain a substantial amount of water and
carbon-based materials, which could offer potential sources of
rocket fuel that could be tapped for exploratory missions to Mars.
   ``Phobos is an attractive way to go to Mars,'' Martin said. ``I
would be surprised if Phobos isn't a part of the U.S. going to
Mars.''

   The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar
into space Friday to rekindle an American planetary exploration
program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and
the Challenger accident.
   The cargo is the Magellan spacecraft which has a radar system
powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of Venus
and map its surface. The mission costs $550 million and the radar
images could reveal much about the history of Venus and the
evolution of our own Earth.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 2:24 p.m. Friday, and six hours later,
Atlantis' five astronauts are to release Magellan on the start of a
466-day outward journey to the mysterious planet.
   No American planetary spacecraft has been launched since the
Pioneer-Venus probe in 1978, and Magellan will be the first
planet-bound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle.
   When the 7,000-pound payload reaches Venus in August 1990, it is
to fire into orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of
the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   He said the images could help scientists understand how Venus
was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of
how Earth and Venus, evolved so differently even though at the
beginning of the solar system they were almost identical. At the
Venusian surface, the temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the
atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on Earth.
   Saunders said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
Venus once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on Earth.
   The radar is designed to produce images showing features as
small as 150 yards across. In comparison, the 1978 Pioneer-Venus
probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across.
   Magellan is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for
launching from Atlantis this year. The Galileo probe to Jupiter is
to set forth in October.
   The two spacecraft have been in development for more than a
decade. They initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a
slowdown in the space program after the completion of the Apollo
man-to-the-moon program.
   They finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff
in 1986. But those flights were derailed after Challenger exploded
in January 1986, grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' Saunders said.
   The first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was
Russia's Venera 1, which scouted Venus in 1961. In the years that
followed, a parade of these vehicles, each more sophisticated than
the last, pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of
our planetary neighbors.
   The United States has successfully sent five probes to Venus,
six to Mars, four to Jupiter, three to Saturn, and one each to
Mercury and Uranus. And in August, the long-traveling Voyager 2 is
to take the first closeup look at Neptune.
   The Soviet Union has sent 19 successful spacecraft to Venus and
nine to Mars. Its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed
_ Phobos 1 last September while en route to Mars and Phobos 2 as it
was starting its exploration from Martian orbit last month.
   Soviet engineers have not perfected the long-term
nuclear-powered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets.
The Soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power
from the sun. But at distant Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus,
these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective.
   At their destinations, some of these robot marvels skim close,
snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring
on to another planet or into interstellar space; some orbit their
targets to examine them at length, and some descend to the surface.
   What they collect is flashed as binary bits to Earth-bound
computers, which translate the unknown into recognizable places
filled with surprises and secrets. Vague speculations of the past
have been replaced by solid scientific findings.
   Humans have caught their first views and hints of the great
storm systems and rings of Jupiter; the active volcanoes on its
salt-covered moon, Io; the parched and cratered wasteland of
Mercury; ancient river bottoms, raging winds and an inactive
volcanoe almost 80,000 feet high on Mars; sulfuric acid clouds,
lightning and the hellish temperatures on Venus; the thousand rings
and tantalizing moons of Saturn; a scalding 6,000-mile deep ocean
beneath the cloudtops of Uranus.
   From these flights, NASA is assembling a vast mosaic about the
solar system and its intricate workings. A basic goal is to learn
more about planet Earth, fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is
the origin, the evolution and the structure of the universe.
   Some astronomers believe, for example, that Mars may today
represent an earlier evolutionary state of Earth when its
atmosphere was being formed, and that Venus may represent what
might happen to Earth if its surface temperature were to rise
significantly.

<HEAD>U.S. To Help Soviets Pick Mars Landing Site For Robot Craft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   NASA has agreed to help pick a landing site on
Mars for a robot craft that the Soviets will launch in 1994,
American and Soviet scientists announced Thursday at a joint news
conference.
   Samuel W. Keller, the head of the NASA delegation that has been
negotiating with Soviet scientists, said that the Soviets have
picked four candidate landing sites after the United States provided
detailed maps of the Martian surface.
   Keller said the Soviets have now asked for more data and details
on the candidate sites.
   He made the comment at a news conference marking the end of a
week of negotiations between representatives of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and a delegation representing
the Soviet solar system exploration program. The two groups met to
work out areas of cooperation.
   Academician Valeriy L. Barsukov, head of the Soviet delegation,
said that the four candidate Mars landing sites are all located
within 30 degrees of the equator, but he declined to be more
specific.
   NASA accumulated a vast amount of detailed images and maps of
Mars during Viking spacecraft missions between 1975 and 1980. The
Viking program put two craft in orbit of Mars and two on the surface.
   The Soviets plan to launch a spacecraft in 1994 that will orbit
Mars and drop a lander that will scoop up soil and return it to
Earth.
   Barsukov said that in picking a landing site the Soviets are
considering such issues as a search for water and life, getting
comprehensive samples of the geology, and gaining insights into the
Martian evolution.
   Keller said other agreements reached during negotiations this
week included:
   _Using the American Deep Space Network to help track and
communicate with Soviet Mars probes.
   _An exchange of scientific personnel for work on specific
missions.
   _An exchange of data on Venus, a planet extensively explored by
both countries. Keller said the U.S.-Soviet studies are being
combined to produce four detailed maps.
   _An exchange of lunar material gathered by the Apollo program for
meteorite material collected by the Soviets.
   _An exchange of scientific instruments for use on planetary
probes.
   Barsukov said that the Soviets feel that a manned Mars landing is
``inevitable'' and that it probably will take place in the middle of
the next century.
   But before a manned mission to Mars is attempted, Barsukov said
there probably will be new manned flights to the moon. He declined
to elaborate.

BUSH'S CALL FOR MISSION TO MARS RECEIVES BROAD SUPPORT FROM SPACE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without spending a nickel, President Bush won widespread support from dissident 
elements of the space community Thursday when he committed the United States to 
embarking on a megabillion-dollar mission that will test human engineering and 
endurance to the limits. 
</P>
<P>
The manned expedition to Mars that the President endorsed is not simply a 
longer journey than a trip to the moon, which takes only about a day and a 
half. It could cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next three decades 
and the crew aboard the spacecraft would have to endure enormous risks during a 
voyage that would last between two and three years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those obstacles, leaders within the nation's space community hailed the 
President's proclamation because for the first time in more than a decade the 
United States has a goal in space exploration mandated from the top. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blueprint Remained Dormant 
</P>
<P>
"He has set our sights very clearly," said Thomas O. Paine, head of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration during the Apollo moon landings 
and the chief architect of a congressionally mandated blueprint for the future 
of the U.S. space program -- a blueprint that has remained dormant since it was 
submitted to the White House several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," said John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy 
Institute at George Washington University and a leading space analyst. "The 
President did exactly the right thing. He gave the kind of overall direction to 
why we are putting humans in space that so many have thought has been lacking." 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the President's speech, the nation's space community began 
healing some deep, self-inflicted wounds. Various factions have fought bitterly 
over which projects should get the highest priority, and that lack of unity has 
threatened to undermine congressional support for space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I have not been a chronic admirer of Republican presidents," said 
Caltech planetary scientist Bruce Murray, who directed the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory during one of its most productive periods. "But Bush said this is 
where we ought to go and that (sense of direction) has been the central problem 
since the end of Apollo." 
</P>
<P>
Like a number of other scientists across the country, Murray has been pushing 
for years for a manned expedition to Mars. He has consistently criticized plans 
to build a manned, orbiting space station, claiming that the $30-billion 
project -- which faces stiff opposition in Congress -- is just another piece of 
equipment, not a goal. 
</P>
<P>
That criticism softened considerably Thursday on the heels of the President's 
speech because the space station, like so many other projects in the space 
program, could play a role in any effort to send astronauts to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Friedman, executive director of the Pasadena-based Planetary Society and 
another outspoken critic of the space station, also eased his position after 
hearing Bush's speech. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest criticism of Bush's statement stemmed from the fact that he did 
not outline the role that other nations would have in a manned expedition to 
Mars, and many believe that only an international program is likely to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"International really means the Soviet Union," noted Murray, because the 
Soviets have the best information about the effects of long-term exposure to 
space. The record -- one year -- is held by a Soviet cosmonaut. 
</P>
<P>
A manned expedition to Mars would be costly, "probably hundreds of billions of 
dollars over a long period of time," but it's "not going to cost much extra 
over the next five years," Logsdon said. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed now, Friedman said, is to work out the details on how such a 
mission should be approached. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the projects that would be precursors to a Mars mission are already on 
the drawing boards. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is already developing plans 
for robotic, unmanned missions to Mars that would collect the information 
needed long before a manned expedition could be launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Space Station would serve as the beginning step toward a permanent 
manned presence in space. It would be followed by an "international spaceport" 
where large vehicles could be assembled in space so that they could be launched 
toward Mars without having to burn the fuel necessary to overcome Earth's 
gravity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knowledge of Mining 
</P>
<P>
A manned laboratory on the moon would allow astronauts to learn how to mine 
materials for permanent facilities, and possibly even extract oxygen and 
hydrogen from the lunar surface to fuel their rocket ships. 
</P>
<P>
Even if all of that could be carried out successfully over the next couple of 
decades, the actual trip to Mars would be filled with such profound challenges 
that it may be beyond human endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years-long trip, the astronauts would be faced with the 
possibility of a meteoroid ripping through their spacecraft, causing rapid 
decompression that would kill them within seconds. 
</P>
<P>
A violent storm on the surface of the sun could blast the spacecraft with 
deadly radiation. So the craft would require some sort of storm shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout much of the trip, the craft would be so far from Earth that the 
astronauts would be pretty much on their own. It would take about 30 minutes 
for messages to travel back and forth between the craft and Earth by the time 
the astronauts reached the vicinity of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts would probably have to spend a year there, waiting for Mars to 
reach the right point in its orbit for them to launch themselves back toward 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
And it would take about a year to get back.

   Scientists searching for life on Mars
agreed Saturday that they must be patient and focus on learning
more about the environment of the cold, dry planet.
   ``If we're going to find life on Mars, it's not going to be just
sitting around in the dust someplace,'' said John D. Rummel, who
directs life biology research for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   ``We're going to have to find places on Mars that are more
likely to contain life forms than you would find at random,'' he
said.
   Rummel was among two dozen scientists from North America, the
Soviet Union, Europe and Japan who attended the International
Symposium on the Biological Exploration of Mars at Florida State
University.
   Three speakers cautioned that it was too soon to conduct direct
life experiments on Mars, but Rummel said most of the scientists
agreed the planet should be studied for insights that could lead to
a discovery of life on the planet.
   ``Mars is not considered by many people to be a lifeless
planet,'' Rummel said.
   Ten years ago, the landings on Mars during the Viking missions
detected no signs of life on Mars, the most Earth-like planet in
the solar system.
   Scientists believe the planet was once more hospitable for the
evolution of life than it is now. Conditions grew harsher,
primarily drier and colder.
   Rummel said some scientists believe that signs of life, either
past or present, might be discovered deeper under the surface, near
heat sources where water might be found.
   The latest data from Mars came from unmanned Soviet missions in
1988. The United States plans to send a spacecraft to orbit Mars in
1992 and the Soviets plan a 1994 mission that would land an
unmanned robotic rover vehicle and balloons to explore the planet's
surface.
   On Earth, scientists are studying volcanoes, ocean bottoms,
lakes and rocks in Antarctica and Siberian permafrost to see what
kinds of life can survive under Martian-like conditions.
   E. Imre Friedmann, a Florida State researcher who organized the
meeting, said there's a good likelihood that life once existed on
Mars.
   ``You cannot really express it numerically, you cannot quantify
it, but it is certainly good enough to justify serious effort to
verify whether or not this is really the case,'' Friedmann said.

<TEXT>     The Stanford plan was scheduled to be presented today to the National Space
Council in Washington, D.C., which advises the president on space policy.;   
Although the idea of a joint U.S.-Soviet mission to Mars was proposed several
years ago by President Gorbachev, planning for the effort never got under way
and each country has been pursuing its own scheme.;    The American version,
endorsed by President Bush two years ago, includes building a space station
and a lunar base before going to Mars, at a total cost of up to $540 billion.;
   The cost of the space station plan has been the focus of intense debate in
Congress. The House voted earlier this month to keep funding alive for another
year, rejecting an earlier vote by the appropriations committee to scuttle the
project.;    Thousands of jobs in California and elsewhere hinge on the $30
billion space station plan. Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. in Sunnyvale,
Silicon Valley's largest employer, has estimated it would lose $1 billion in
space-station-related contracts over the next decade if the plan is scuttled.;
   Critics of the space station plan, however, contend it would rob funds from
other space programs and from social programs for the poor.;    The Stanford
plan bypasses both the space station and the moon base in favor of going to
Mars directly.;    Sometime around the year 2012, a series of spacecraft
carrying cargo and crew would be boosted into low Earth orbit aboard the
Soviet Energia rocket, which can carry much heavier loads than anything NASA
now has to offer.;    They then would be flung out of orbit like rocks from a
sling for the nine-month journey to Mars.;    When the crew of three men and
three women arrived, they would find apartments and a garage with tracked
exploration vehicles waiting for them, sent up in advance by an unmanned
rocket. They would stay about a year before embarking for the nine-month
journey back.;    The total cost: $60 billion, including several preliminary
unmanned missions to map the Martian surface and explore it with robots.;   
Scrapping the space station -- now estimated to cost up to $120 billion over
its lifetime -- and a $10 billion heavy-lift rocket would save money and more
than 10 years.;    The no-frills mission would also take two steps to protect
the health of the astronauts during their long flight. It would incorporate 22
tons of water and other shielding into the spacecraft to insulate them from
cosmic radiation, which could reach a lethal peak during solar storms.;    And
the craft would rotate four times per minute to provide some artificial
gravity in the hope of avoiding deterioration of the astronauts' hearts, bones
and blood vessels.;    The plan was drafted by graduate students in a Stanford
space systems engineering class taught by Bruce Lusignan, professor of
electrical engineering. The Stanford team also included a former vice
president of TRW's spacecraft engineering division, Emery Reeves; an expert in
robotics, Thomas Binford; and Larry Colin, former chief of the space science

   Buzz Aldrin laments that ``the
promise of Apollo was never fulfilled,'' that the American space
program languished after he and Neil Armstrong left the first human
footprints on the moon two decades ago.
   He says he hopes the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 will ``become
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human
expansion outward.''
   But given today's political and tight budgetary climate, Aldrin
is not too hopeful.
   President Bush is expected to voice continuing support for a
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about
NASA's program when he meets with Aldrin, Armstrong and their
command module pilot, Michael Collins, on July 20, the anniversary
of the moon landing.
   But no matter how many nice things the president says about
space, the political truth is that Congress must approve the money.
And with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut,
Congress is not expected to give much support to new projects.
   So the National Aeronautics and Space Administration once again
is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended.
   President John F. Kennedy had committed this nation to landing a
man on the moon in the 1960s. The goal was to gain space superiority
over the Soviet Union, whose early feats had earned the Russians
worldwide respect and shocked Americans.
   When the United States won the race to the moon, NASA laid out
bold plans for the future.
   To a presidential panel, agency head Thomas Paine in 1969
proposed a 12-man space station and a reusable space shuttle in
operation as early as 1976, followed by a station in moon orbit, a
base on the moon, a 50-man space station in Earth orbit and a manned
mission to Mars in the 1980s.
   But in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and
involvement in Vietnam, costly plans to explore space were given low
priority.
   Only the reuseable space shuttle survived, and its proposed
funding was cut deeply.
   ``Those were tough times,'' said Paine, who resigned in
frustration a year after Apollo 11.
   The Ford and Carter administrations were lukewarm toward the
space program, but the shuttle was built. It performed capably as a
space truck for 24 missions until Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger
exploded, killing its seven crew members and grounding the program
for 32 months.
   NASA had gained some hope from President Reagan's endorsement of
a strong space program and from his 1984 State of the Union message,
in which he backed building the space station Freedom.
   In 1985, Congress created a commission to define long-term space
goals. Its chief was Thomas Paine, the former NASA administrator.
   Six months after Challenger, Paine stood in the Oval Office and
gave Reagan a slick leather-bound volume that recommended the space
station, a lunar base and manned trips to Mars _ essentially an
update of Paine's 1969 plan.
   Reagan two years later signed a Presidential Directive on
National Space Policy that stated space leadership was a fundamental
objective. It endorsed the space station and, without being
specific, set a long-range goal ``to expand human presence and
activity beyond Earth orbit into the solar system.''
   Reagan's policy set in motion a NASA program named Pathfinder
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic
exploration of the moon and planets, advanced missions in orbit and
on planetary surfaces, extended human presence in space, and space
transportation to the moon and planets.
   Bush has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a
space station. He established the National Space Council, headed by
Vice President Dan Quayle, to recommend a comprehensive space policy.
   Quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for Bush's
anniversary meeting with the Apollo 11 astronauts.
   NASA needs a decision from Congress soon on how much money it can
spend next year on space station Freedom. A permanent orbiting space
station is essential to those ambitious Pathfinder dreams and would
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into
space.
   Bush has requested $2.05 billion in the budget for fiscal 1990 to
continue work on the station. Predictions are that Congress will
trim that by $400 million to $700 million, amounts that space
officials say could further delay or even kill the project.
   The space station project has gone through five tumultuous years.
Reagan wanted it built in cooperation with America's major allies,
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10
European nations, Japan and Canada agreed to invest nearly $8
billion to build sections of it.
   NASA said in 1984 it could begin launching segments of the
orbiting laboratory in 1992 and estimated the U.S. cost at $8
billion. In 1987, agency officials revised the pricetag to $14.6
billion. The new figure covered a suddenly scaled-down Phase One,
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment
modules would be attached. The struts would be added in orbit under
Phase Two.
   Shortly after that, a National Research Council panel reviewing
station costs and technical issues for the White House said the
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be $25.02
billion, with Phase Two raising the cost to $32.8 billion.
   The schedule began slipping. And NASA now says if it receives the
proper funding, it could begin assembling the station in 1995.
   Some in Congress believe NASA should alter its plans and build a
less complex station and, instead of relying totally on the space
shuttle, develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting
job.
   Orbiting at 250 miles, Freedom would be home to a crew of eight,
with astronauts rotating back to Earth after four to six months.
   The station would allow humans to study the stars and planets
from the pollution-free environment of space. The weightless
interior would permit manufacture of new, contamination-free
medicines and other products impossible to create on Earth.
Astronauts would assemble, service and repair satellites and send
them out into space. And the station could eventually be the staging
point for man's return to the moon or a journey to Mars.
   No one can predict whether these grand plans will come about, but
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary Apollo 11 flight to
the moon 20 years ago think they should.
   ``A permanent presence in space is a worthy objective, and I hope
that space station Freedom becomes a reality,'' Neil Armstrong said
recently.
   ``I strongly endorse the station, a scientific base on the moon
and eventually manned flights to Mars,'' said Buzz Aldrin.
   Michael Collins, who orbited the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin
walked its surface, envisioned setting up a colony on Mars.
   ``We're a nation of explorers,'' he said. ``We started on the
East Coast, we went to the West Coast, and then vertically. Starting
with the Wright brothers, Chuck Yeager through the sound barrier,
Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon.
   ``It's in our tradition, it's in our culture.''

   Space officials from more than a dozen countries converged on a Central Asian steppe yesterday for the launching of the first of two probes to Phobos, the potato-shaped moon of Mars. 

   The Soviet Union says the mission will help prepare for manned flight to the planet. 

   Soviet media said final preparations were being made at the Baikonur launch site in Kazakhstan for the liftoff today of Phobos I, a joint East-West project to study Phobos and Mars itself. 
Phobos II, the second satellite, is scheduled to be launched Tuesday. 

   Soviet television this week showed the silver-white Phobos I and its 60-yard-tall Soviet-made Proton rocket being moved into place. 

   The satellites will enter Mars's gravity in January and begin a three-month remote study of the surface and atmosphere of the planet. 
After that, scientists said, they will draw closer to Phobos and drop descent vehicles carrying laser, ionic and radar equipment to help determine the internal structure and composition of the moon. 
The probes are expected to be sent to Phobos in about April of next year, according to Roald Sagdeyev, director of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Space Research Institute. 

   Soviet space scientists said Phobos is an important step toward a manned flight to Mars, which they hope can take place in the early 21st century. 
Officials including Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev have proposed that the U.S. take part in the mission. 

   "First, it is necessary to draw up a more accurate map of the Mars surface in order to choose a place for the future landing," said Vyacheslav Balebanov, a deputy to Mr. Sagdeyev. 

   "Then, it is necessary to study the climate and soil characteristics and find out whether oxygen should be taken from Earth, or whether it can be gotten directly on the planet. 
The study of Mars renewed under the Phobos program should provide answers to those questions," he said in an interview with the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya. 

   The Soviet news agency Tass said that the Phobos television system will provide color photographs and that a memory unit will permit transmission of up to 1,100 pictures to Earth. 

   Soviet space officials said the launching itself will cost about $65 million and that the total cost of the project was about $480 million. 

   Also participating in the project are Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany, Ireland, Poland, Finland, France, West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Sweden, the U.S. and the European Space Agency. 
Many of those countries have provided equipment for experiments to be conducted by Phobos. 

   The U.S., a late entry into the Martian mission as relations have warmed with the Soviet Union, will be represented at the launching by a group headed by Lt. Gen. Donald Cromer, head of the Air Force space division, said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Marguerite Squire. 

   The Deep Space Network of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration will provide tracking data to permit two 100-pound landers to reach Phobos, and then will begin to track the Martian moon precisely using antennas in California, Spain and Australia, and a Soviet radio telescope in the Crimea. 

   U.S. scientists say the Deep Space Network can determine distance within yards, and the velocity of spacecraft billons of miles from Earth. 

   Mr. Balebanov said scientists also suspect that Phobos is gradually drawing closer to Mars. 
The U.S. tracking may help to determine if that is true. 

   The Phobos craft will carry a plaque commemorating Phobos's discovery by a U.S. astronomer. 

   The probe is launched while the U.S. is still trying to recover from the loss of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. 
Since then, the Soviet Union has had several space achievements, including the 326-day mission of cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko aboard the Mir orbiting space station. 

   The Soviet Union first sent a satellite toward Mars in 1962. 
The Mars-1 craft was the first of about 15 Soviet and U.S. probes that gathered a large amount of data from the planet, but not enough to determine the feasibility of a manned mission, Soviet scientists say. 

   Phobos "is a logical development of the Soviet program of Mars exploration that was started about a quarter of a century ago," cosmonaut Alexei Leonov told Tass.

   The manned station Freedom, an
orbiting outpost of America in the icy silence of space, will take
center stage in the U.S. space effort in the 1990s, and be a
springboard for human journeys to the moon and Mars.
   American scientists also expect to reap a rich harvest during
the decade with an armada of sophisticated unmanned spacecraft that
will explore the planets and peer back into the beginning of time.
   At the same time, the Soviets will continue development of a
space shuttle and exploit their own space station Mir as they
pursue their stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to Mars early in
the 21st century.
   And the growing space programs of the European Space Agency,
Japan and China will expand as they embark on their own manned
space efforts.
   As the new decade begins, America's future course is uncertain.
Its space program is at a crossroads, and it will be up to the Bush
administration, the Congress and the people to decide which
direction it should take.
   In July, on the 20th anniversary of man's first landing on the
moon, President Bush stood on the steps of the National Air and
Space Museum and declared, ``We must commit ourselves anew to a
sustained program of manned exploration of the solar system, and,
yes, the permanent settlement of space.''
   He proposed ``a long-term, continuing commitment'' to completion
of space station Freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent base on
the moon and a manned mission to Mars early in the next century.
   But the president provided no firm timetable or budgets for such
grand schemes, instead directing Vice President Dan Quayle, as head
of the National Space Council, to work out the details.
   Bush is expected to offer a more detailed plan in his State of
the Union address early next year.
   Freedom is the key element in the entire exploration plan, since
it would serve as a training base and launchpad for the more
ambitious flights to the moon and Mars.
   But the space station has had a troubled history. The original
plan called for astronauts aboard space shuttles to begin
assembling it in orbit in 1992, with a total of 20 shuttle flights
needed to have it fully operational by 1995.
   Cost overruns, budget cuts and NASA's poor job of selling the
station to a skeptical Congress have delayed the project, and
initial assembly is now scheduled to start in 1995 or 1996.
   The U.S. cost will be about $25 billion, with European, Japanese
and Canadian partners contributing modules and other station
facilities worth an additional $8 billion. This will give
astronaut-researchers of these nations access to the station and
provide them with valuable experience for developing independent
manned space programs.
   Orbiting 250 miles up, the station would provide living and
working quarters for as many as eight people, with astronauts
rotating back to Earth after four to six months. Some would stay
longer to gain long-term exposure to weightless living, in
preparation for a Mars flight that might take as long as 18 months.
   As a scientific base, the station will allow humans to study the
stars and planets from the pollution-free environment of space. The
weightless world will permit the processing of new, pure medicines,
metals and other products that cannot be made in Earth's gravity.
And astronauts aboard Freedom would assemble, service and repair
satellites and send them out to explore space.
   Space science is experiencing a resurgence after years of
neglect because of tight NASA budgets.
   ``We are embarking on a golden age of space science,'' said
Lennard Fisk, the agency's associate administrator for space
science and applications. ``What's coming up is an era of
unprecedented excitement and activity.''
   Among the events scheduled in the 1990s:
   _Magellan, launched from a space shuttle last May, is to orbit
Venus next August and will study that planet for several years.
   _Galileo, launched from a shuttle in October, is to orbit
Jupiter in 1995 and fire a probe into its atmosphere. En route,
Galileo will probe Venus and take the first closeup look at an
asteroid.
   _COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer), set for launch Nov. 19, will
spend years studying how stars and galaxies were formed by
analyzing cosmic background radiation consisting of particles of
light, or photons, permeating the universe.
   _ROSAT, a cooperative mission with West Germany, will be
launched next year to send back a detailed survey of X-rays emitted
into the universe by violent explosions, such as those occurring at
the end of a star's life.
   _Hubble Space Telescope, to be launched from a shuttle next
March, will enable astronomers to observe stars and galaxies so far
away that they will be viewing these remote bodies as they existed
14 billion years ago, near the time scientists believe the universe
was formed.
   _Mars Observer will be launched in 1992 to orbit the red planet
for a multiyear examination.
   _Other payloads scheduled for deployment from the shuttle in the
next few years include a series of Astro spacecraft carrying
ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes to study quasars, pulsars and
other celestial objects; the Gamma Ray Observatory to explore gamma
ray sources throughout the universe, and Ulysses, to probe the sun.
   During the 1990s, NASA will also continue research, together
with the Defense Department, on developing the National Aerospace
Plane, which would take off from a runway like a jet plane and
accelerate into orbit. If Congress provides adequate funding for
this next-generation manned space vehicle, a prototype could begin
test flights late in the decade, and it could become operational
sometime after 2000.

space shuttle and exploit their own space station Mir as they
pursue their stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to Mars early in
the 21st century.
   And the growing space programs of the European Space Agency,
Japan and China will expand as they embark on their own manned
space efforts.
   As the new decade begins, America's future course is uncertain.
Its space program is at a crossroads, and it will be up to the Bush
administration, the Congress and the people to decide which
direction it should take.
   In July, on the 20th anniversary of man's first landing on the
moon, President Bush stood on the steps of the National Air and
Space Museum and declared, ``We must commit ourselves anew to a
sustained program of manned exploration of the solar system, and,
yes, the permanent settlement of space.''
   He proposed ``a long-term, continuing commitment'' to completion
of space station Freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent base on
the moon and a manned mission to Mars early in the next century.
   But the president provided no firm timetable or budgets for such
grand schemes, instead directing Vice President Dan Quayle, as head
of the National Space Council, to work out the details.
   Bush is expected to offer a more detailed plan in his State of
the Union address early next year.
   Freedom is the key element in the entire exploration plan, since
it would serve as a training base and launchpad for the more
ambitious flights to the moon and Mars.
   But the space station has had a troubled history. The original
plan called for astronauts aboard space shuttles to begin
assembling it in orbit in 1992, with a total of 20 shuttle flights
needed to have it fully operational by 1995.
   Cost overruns, budget cuts and NASA's poor job of selling the
station to a skeptical Congress have delayed the project, and
initial assembly is now scheduled to start in 1995 or 1996.
   The U.S. cost will be about $25 billion, with European, Japanese
and Canadian partners contributing modules and other station
facilities worth an additional $8 billion. This will give
astronaut-researchers of these nations access to the station and
provide them with valuable experience for developing independent
manned space programs.
   Orbiting 250 miles up, the station would provide living and
working quarters for as many as eight people, with astronauts
rotating back to Earth after four to six months. Some would stay
longer to gain long-term exposure to weightless living, in
preparation for a Mars flight that might take as long as 18 months.
   As a scientific base, the station will allow humans to study the
stars and planets from the pollution-free environment of space. The
weightless world will permit the processing of new, pure medicines,
metals and other products that cannot be made in Earth's gravity.
And astronauts aboard Freedom would assemble, service and repair
satellites and send them out to explore space.
   Space science is experiencing a resurgence after years of
neglect because of tight NASA budgets.
   ``We are embarking on a golden age of space science,'' said
Lennard Fisk, the agency's associate administrator for space
science and applications. ``What's coming up is an era of
unprecedented excitement and activity.''
   Among the events scheduled in the 1990s:
   _Magellan, launched from a space shuttle last May, is to orbit
Venus next August and will study that planet for several years.
   _Galileo, launched from a shuttle in October, is to orbit
Jupiter in 1995 and fire a probe into its atmosphere. En route,
Galileo will probe Venus and take the first closeup look at an
asteroid.
   _COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer), set for launch Nov. 19, will
spend years studying how stars and galaxies were formed by
analyzing cosmic background radiation consisting of particles of
light, or photons, permeating the universe.
   _ROSAT, a cooperative mission with West Germany, will be
launched next year to send back a detailed survey of X-rays emitted
into the universe by violent explosions, such as those occurring at
the end of a star's life.
   _Hubble Space Telescope, to be launched from a shuttle next
March, will enable astronomers to observe stars and galaxies so far
away that they will be viewing these remote bodies as they existed
14 billion years ago, near the time scientists believe the universe
was formed.
   _Mars Observer will be launched in 1992 to orbit the red planet
for a multiyear examination.
   _Other payloads scheduled for deployment from the shuttle in the
next few years include a series of Astro spacecraft carrying
ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes to study quasars, pulsars and
other celestial objects; the Gamma Ray Observatory to explore gamma
ray sources throughout the universe, and Ulysses, to probe the sun.
   During the 1990s, NASA will also continue research, together
with the Defense Department, on developing the National Aerospace
Plane, which would take off from a runway like a jet plane and
accelerate into orbit. If Congress provides adequate funding for
this next-generation manned space vehicle, a prototype could begin
test flights late in the decade, and it could become operational
sometime after 2000.

   The Soviet Union launched an unmanned probe
Thursday night on a six-month trip to Mars' moon, Phobos, for a
mission designed to pave the way for a manned voyage to the red
planet.
   The 180-foot-tall booster rocket spewed orange and blue flames
as it illuminated the nighttime sky at the Baikonur space center in
the Soviet Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan.
   The launch of the Proton rocket carrying the probe, Phobos I,
was carried live on Soviet television, which reported that the
spacecraft's flight was proceeding normally.
   More than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to
swoop close to the surface of Phobos and drop probes onto the
little, potato-shaped Martian moon that scientists say may hold
clues to how the universe was formed.
   Delegations from around the world gathered at Baikonur for the
launch of Phobos I, a joint East-West project to study the moon and
Mars itself.
   A companion probe, Phobos II, is scheduled for launch on July 12.
   If all goes well, the two spacecraft will enter the
gravitational pull of Mars in January 1989 and fall into orbit just
behind Phobos for a three-month remote study of the surface and
atmosphere of the planet. In April, the craft will drop out of
their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moon's surface,
where they will release two small landers.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Thursday that in one
experiment, a laser beam will be used to split a tiny piece of
Phobos' rocky surface and trap a specimen for close examination.
   One of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in
stationary position, sending back data. Another is designed to leap
around the little moon in 20-yard hops gathering soil samples and
analyzing them.
   This is the most sophisticated and ambitious of 18 Soviet and
U.S. unmanned missions to study Mars.
   Soviet space scientists have characterized the Phobos mission as
an important step toward a manned flight to Mars, which they hope
will be possible in the early 21st century.
   The Phobos probes will help map the surface of the planet ``in
order to choose a place for the future landing,'' said Vyacheslav
Balebanov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Space Research
Institute. ``Then, it is necessary to study the climate and soil
characteristics and find out whether oxygen should be taken from
Earth, or whether it can be gotten directly on the planet.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed that the United
States join in the prospective manned mission, but American
officials have been cool to the idea, saying it would be very
expensive and would require solutions to many difficult problems,
one of which is the problem of astronauts' physical deterioration
during long periods of weightlessness.
   Soviet space officials have put the cost of the Phobos mission
at $480 million.
   In addition to the Soviets, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, East
Germany, Ireland, Poland, Finland, France, West Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Sweden, the United States and the
European Space Agency are participating in the flight. The United
States, a late entry, will provide tracking data with its Deep
Space Network that can determine distances within yards and the
velocity of objects billions of miles from Earth.
   The Phobos craft also will carry a plaque commemorating the
moon's discovery by an American astronomer.

<HEAD>Soviet Mars Probe Lost in Space Because of Controller's Error</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A multimillion-dollar space probe designed to
unlock the secrets of Mars fell into a ``deep lethargic sleep'' and
is worthless because of a ground controller's error, a scientist
said Friday.
   It was the second Soviet space mishap revealed this week.
   ``Only a miracle can save it now,'' Roald Z. Sagdeyev, head of
the Soviet Space Research Institute, said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   Ground-control operators are unable to communicate with the
Phobos 1 probe, now millions of miles from Earth.
   This week, a Soyuz TM-5 capsule carrying two cosmonauts came
close to being marooned in space because of equipment problems and
mistakes by the ship's commander delayed its return to Earth.
   Sagdeyev said scientists would now have to rely on a sister
ship, Phobos 2, that is also racing toward the Red Planet. Phobos 1
was launched July 7 and Phobos 2 five days later in missions that
cost $480 million.
   The probes were scheduled to go into orbit around Mars and in
January drop behind Phobos, the larger of the planet's two moons,
to study the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field.
   Phobos 1 was to drop a lander that would stay in one place on
the surface of the moon for a year. Phobos 2 was to deploy a lander
that would hop around on the moon in 20-yard leaps, gathering and
analyzing soil samples.
   Phobos 1 is still moving in space, but it may not be on its
planned trajectory because the orientation and guidance systems
aren't functioning. It was not immediately known how the original
plan would be modified now that one of the probes is useless.
   Sagdeyev said a ground control operator at the Soviet Mission
Control Center near Moscow sent an incorrect command to Phobos 1
during the night of Aug. 29-30 and that a computer failed to detect
the error and flash the signal, ``bad command.'' He did not say
whether the faulty computer was on the ground or on board the
spacecraft.
   ``The command signified the slow suicide of the machinery,
Phobos 1,'' said Sagdeyev. ``It lost orientation, and the solar
panels stopped looking at the sun. In two to three days a
cooling-down of the craft occurred.''
   ``The machinery has simply frozen. It fell into a deep,
lethargic sleep,'' the scientist said.
   The mistake was only discovered three days later. Sagdeyev said
investigators also determined that no second operator was on duty
to check the work of the controller who made the mistake, violating
the control center's rules. He did not say if either controller was
punished.
   Sagdeyev, the most prominent Soviet space scientist and a major
supporter of the exploration of Mars, said ground controllers were
still sending signals to Phobos 1 to restore orientation, but were
having no luck. He suggested they now turn their attention to
Phobos 2 and ``do everything to prevent a repetition of the mistake
with the second machine.''
   The space research chief spoke to a reporter during a reception
at the U.S. ambassador's residence in honor of Andrei D. Sakharov,
the Soviet physicist and human rights activist who is the 1975
Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   On Tuesday, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Lyakhov and his Afghan
crewmate, Ahad Abdul Mohmand, had to postpone landing of their
Soyuz TM-5 capsule because a sensor used to orient the craft and a
computer malfunctioned.
   In addition to the equipment problems, Lyakhov said later he
acted improperly during one landing attempt and made the problems
worse. The two, who were running low on air and food, returned to
Earth safely Wednesday.
   NASA, the American National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, was to have helped the Soviets track Phobos 1 next
month, but NASA official Raymond J. Amorose said Thursday the
Soviets reported they lost contact with the craft.
   NASA was also supposed to have worked with Phobos 1 in a joint
U.S.-Soviet study of the sun.
   The Tass news agency indicated that scientists were in normal
contact with Phobos 2 and said it was 11.8 million miles from Earth.
   After a 111 million-mile trip, both craft were to have fallen
into orbit behind Phobos for a three-month remote study meant to
help unlock mysteries of Mars, which some scientists believe may
once have hosted life. In April, the craft were to drop out of
their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moon's surface,
where they were to release two small landers.
   It is the most ambitious of about 18 Soviet and U.S. unmanned
missions to study Mars, which, next to Venus, is believed to be
most like Earth.

   In the glow of celebrating the Apollo 11
anniversary with the men who landed on the lunar surface, President
Bush proposed a commitment to go back to the moon _ ``this time,
back to stay.''
   The trip he laid out for the nation would be step-by-step: a
space station first, then the moon, and eventually Mars. ``Each
mission should and will lay the groundwork for the next,'' the
president said.
   That's akin to laying the groundwork for a driving trip across
country by wheeling around the block for a few years and then
gaining experience in the next suburb for a few years more.
   Predictably, advocates of exploring with satellites and probes _
which don't need expensive creature comforts _ were aghast. But
manned space flight supporters rushed to praise the Bush outline,
delivered Thursday on the 20th anniversary of the first moon
landing.
   Space station yes. Mars yes. But why go to the moon?
   ``In my view there is no good reason,'' said Carl Sagan, the
Cornell astronomer who has led the scientific community's fight for
sending humans to Mars. ``The moon is not much like Mars. It's not
any closer to Mars, in the idea of a way station or stepping stone.
   ``Scientifically it is very different. Mars has an atmosphere,
polar caps, evidence of past running water. It has the possibility
of ancient life. The moon has none of that. The moon is static,
airless, pretty dull.''
   Lewis Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society,
said: ``The case for a moon base has not yet been made. The idea of
permanently occupying the moon is one that is not justified.
   ``We haven't permanently occupied the oceans. The notion that we
are going back to the moon to stay, and all that implies, is not
yet well founded.''
   Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., chairman of the House space
subcommittee, said he would prefer to send astronauts straight to
Mars ``unless there is extraordinary scientific value for that
being a first step.'' There's been no such evidence, he said, and
``common sense would say it will delay us in time and it will cost
us more if we go back to the moon.''
   The New York Times, in an editorial, called a return to the moon
``a failure of imagination and fresh thought'' and pointed out that
NASA already has a ton of moon rocks.
   The president offered neither timetable nor money in his
expansive vision for ``a journey into tomorrow'' whose bills will
come due long after he has moved out of the White House. What he
offered is American leadership.
   ``Why the moon? Why Mars? Because it is humanity's destiny to
strive, to seek, to find. And because it is America's destiny to
lead,'' he said.
   The budding controversy is joined by those who, like Rep. Bill
Green, R-N.Y., think only machines belong in space, not humans.
   ``Currently, Congress is split between science and go-man-go,''
he said. ``I see no scientific justification for putting a colony
on the moon and no scientific justification for visiting Mars.''
   And, he added, one cost of sending men to the moon first is to
get to Mars later. ``If you're going to Mars directly, you are
looking at (the year) 2009. But if you are going to do it via the
moon, you are looking at the second decade in the 21st Century.''
   None of this comes as any surprise to Frank Martin, who heads
the exploration office of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``I'm sure we are going to have a nice debate over this in the
next six months,'' he said. ``As you can imagine, we put a lot of
thought into this. Recognizing in the long term that Mars is
sexier, it's the long range view we need to be taking.''
   Nobody wants to repeat the mistakes of the Apollo program of the
1960s, when getting to the moon and returning home was the only
goal: to beat the Soviets.
   The moon is attractive as an outpost, Martin said, because
``it's possible to have significant achievements in 10 years. When
you start asking people to work and asking the nation to focus on
something, it's got to be something where the milestone is
achievable in some finite period.''
   Other good reasons, said Martin, are:
   _ ``We know a great deal about the moon, we have ... a good data
base of understanding of what's there and how to work with that.
   _ ``It's nearby, it's three days away. When you commit people to
Mars you are talking six months to a year just to get there.
   _ ``Mars is one third of the gravitational field of the Earth;
the moon is one sixth Earth gravity ... if they do well in the one
sixth gravitational environment we know they will do well in
one-third G.''
   In addition, he said, the technical and engineering experiences
on the surface of the moon can be used to develop the systems to be
used on Mars.
   In Sagan's view that's not a good argument for a moon stop.
   ``I understand the institutional reasons for wanting an
intermediate goal,'' he said, ``but what worries me is that the
milestone may supplant the objective _ that the moon may be a dead
end. It might gobble up all the fiscal, intellectual and practical
resources. There is no test for Mars exploration we can't do more
cheaply or safely in Earth orbit or on the Earth itself.''
   Sagan and Friedman praised the Bush speech.
   ``It is, after all, the first commitment by an American
president to send humans to Mars,'' said Sagan. ``If it contained
absolutely nothing else, I'm for it.''
   Friedman said Bush should be commended ``for finally being a
president who stepped up to say space has a national purpose to
serve the country.''
   Both scientists said they wished Bush had proposed the Mars
journey as an international venture with the Soviets, who have said
they wanted to do it that way.
   ``Missions of this scale cannot be justified to satisfy the
curiosity of scientists to provide some vicarious sense of
exploration by the American people,'' Sagan said. ``It's too much
money. Just as Apollo needed a major political justification, the
competition with the Russians, so this needs a major political
justification. It can't be just competition; it has to be
cooperation.''

   Here's a book about space exploration in which intrepid
robot spacecraft explore distant worlds, while astronauts and
NASA bureaucrats generally muck things up. Given the dismal
failures of the manned space shuttle and the glorious
triumphs of Voyager, the premise sounds about right.
   But in "Exploring Space: Voyages in the Solar System and
Beyond" (Random House, 448 pages, $24.95), William F. Burrows
manages to make space exploration unbearably dull. He's
written a book about soulless machines built by the dullest
humans on Earth. To get a better sense of the joy of
discovery, turn on "Star Trek" or "Nova."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the title of his book promises more, Mr. Burrows
delivers a history of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's program for unmanned planetary exploration.
He catalogs in excruciating detail 30 years of space
launches, starting with the early failures of the Pioneer and
Ranger craft and ending with the successes of Voyager. But
Mr. Burrows, director of New York University's science and
environmental reporting program, forgets the first rule of
journalism -- or writing for that matter. To entice someone
to read a story, you need characters, plot, theme and so on.
Instead he offers lists and factoids.
   Mr. Burrows tells the reader that the Mariner spacecrafts
that zoomed past Venus and Mars in the 1960s had on board a
radio, data encoder, video storage equipment, a command
system and about a dozen other machines. He says they used
less power than a refrigerator light bulb. But he doesn't say
much at all about the dreams or characters of the people who
built the Mariners or how the craft's first glimpses of the
planets changed the way people back on Earth thought about
the heavens.
   Combine this fault with plain bad writing -- "If {Apollo}
was a circus, {scientists} at least had the consolation of
knowing that they numbered among its shareholders," he notes
at one point -- and you have a book that plods when it should
soar.
   Mr. Burrows's weaknesses didn't matter much in his earlier
book, "Deep Black," a popular history of U.S. spy satellites.
In the highly classified reconnaissance program, so little is
publicly known that machines become the main story. The
question of whether a spy satellite can read a license plate
on the ground, as claimed, or just a street sign takes on
more significance than it merits in spy-satellite books. But
the machines really are impressive. They help us keep tabs on
our enemies and represent one of the few high-tech areas left
where we still clearly lead the Japanese.
   "Exploring Space" does have some strengths. Mr. Burrows
describes in detail the bureaucratic battles that precede
each major planetary project, giving outsiders a look at the
desultory world of space politics. He also gives ample
evidence that the space shuttle was oversold, underfunded and
bound to run into trouble -- a disturbing parallel to NASA's
planned $37 billion space station.
   But he just can't make space exploration come alive.
That's a terrible shame, because the planetary program is
populated by a host of colorful scientists. Among many others
are James Van Allen, whose first space probe discovered that
the Earth is surrounded by radiation belts, and who
relentlessly opposed the space shuttle; Edward Stone, the
unflappable chief Voyager scientist who meticulously jots
down every observation in numbered notebooks; and Carl Sagan,
the most eloquent of the planetary scientists, and the most
maddening.
   None of these men or scientists of similar stature are
described in detail in "Exploring Space." Indeed, the book's
sole vivid character is Wernher Von Braun, the proselytizer
for manned exploration, who wanted NASA to build giant
rotating space stations and colonize Mars. Mr. Burrows
clearly thinks that such manned extravaganzas are a waste of
time and money. But he describes unmanned planetary missions
with such leaden prose that the reader might wonder why the
U.S. ever bothered launching them.
   What's missing is a recognition that the planetary program
has genuinely changed intellectual thought in the 20th
century. Before these space probes were launched, scientists
and the many others believed that Mars and Venus might teem
with life, while most of the other planets were dull blobs.
The robots proved that all wrong.
   Now we know with near certainty that we are the only life
in the solar system. But we can also marvel at the stunning
diversity of the worlds around us -- on one moon geysers ooze
ice; on another, they propel gasses 60 miles into the
atmosphere. And we can only guess at the mysteries that lie
deeper in the universe.
   Lyricism and Mr. Burrows, though, are strangers. He
concludes the main body of his book about space exploration
this way: "The quality of a civilization, as {scientist}
Bruce Murray has observed, is measured not by what it has to
do, but by what it wants to do. In that sense, even space
itself is not the final frontier. The mind is." Carl Sagan,
where are you when we need you?

   NASA may have to conduct extensive
psychological testing, including some experiments that could last
years, before it can select crews for deep space flights such as a
voyage to Mars, an advisory panel said Wednesday.
   In a study of NASA's future needs for space exploration, the
panel said the agency will have to conduct extensive test programs
and develop new criteria for the selection of astronauts.
   The study, ``Exploring the Living Universe,'' outlines in broad
terms the changes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
must make in order to be ready to staff a space station in Earth
orbit for months at a time, or to develop the equipment and
personnel for exploration beyond Earth orbit.
   ``Life sciences as it has been is inadequate to support the
goals of NASA,'' said Frederick C. Robbins, a Nobel laureate who
was chairman of the study committee.
   Robbins said the space agency must strengthen research areas not
only to learn how to send humans into space for long periods of
time, but also to explore the universe for possible life forms and
to study the planet central to the human species _ the Earth.
   He said the studies should gather more knowledge about the
effect of mankind on the Earth's environment because ``the threat
to our environment is real and is becoming more important to us all
the time. I would suggest that this (research) might provide a
mechanism for our continued existence on this planet.''
   Robbins said NASA will have to gain significantly more knowledge
about the effects of weightlessness and forced confinement on the
human body before the agency can hope to attempt long-term space
flight aboard the space station or to attempt a voyage to Mars.
   U.S. experience in long-term space flight is limited to the 84
days of Skylab 3, and this is not enough data to commit to missions
lasting years, such as a voyage to Mars, Robbins said.
   He said the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko holds the world
space record of 326 days, but the Soviet Union has yet to share the
specific phsysiological data collected on that mission.
   The weightlessness of space causes muscles to atrophy, bones to
lose minerals and become thinner, and the cardiovascular system to
decondition. This reaction, called the space adaptation syndrome,
must be understood thoroughly before long-term space flight is
possible.
   Gerald Carr, a former astronaut who commanded the 84-day Skylab
flight and who helped prepare the report, said NASA also must study
the psychological aspects of long-term space flight.
   Carr said the current astronaut selection methods are not
adequate for choosing crew members for flights that could last
years.
   ``NASA is going to have to conduct very long-term tests in
situations where the test crew knows it can't `king's X' and walk
away from it,'' Carr said. He said what is currently known about
the confinement for years of small group of people in hazardous
situations, such as space flight, is inadequate ``because nobody
has ever done a study.''
   Carr said that the criterion used for selecting astronauts in
the past must be changed because future astronauts will face
stresses far more complex than those known to the people of Apollo
and Skylab.
   William C. Schneider, a former NASA executive who headed the
Skylab program and who also was on the study committee, said it is
``quite likely'' that NASA will have to conduct tests that could
last 500 days to 600 days to determine the criteria for selecting
crew members for long-duration space flight.
   ``There simply is no other way to gather the data,'' he said.
   In other recommendations, the committee said NASA should:
   _Conduct an intensified program of orbital experiments on human
life support in space, including development of self-contained
systems that recirculate oxygen and water.
   _Increase studies on the effects of gravity and weightlessness
on Earth life forms, including plants.
   _Increase studies related to the possible existence of life
forms beyond the Earth and on issues related to the evolution of
life.

   The shuttle Atlantis and its five
astronauts were ready for a midafternoon launch today on a mission
to start a robot craft streaking toward Venus, the cloud-shrouded
planet that is an abiding mystery to scientists.
   The crew finished final spacecraft checks and NASA officials
said the space probe called Magellan was ready as the 23-minute
launch window approached. The schedule called for liftoff no
earlier than 2:24 p.m.
   Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, said launch of the
explorer craft Magellan will mark ``a resurgence of America's
planetary program.'' The last American probe to deep space was
dispatched in 1978.
   Preparations moved smoothly since the countdown began Tuesday. A
launch control commentator announced ``all conditions look good''
for launch time weather in Florida. Officials kept close watch on
wind conditions at emergency landing sites here and across the
Atlantic Ocean.
   Atlantis was scheduled to lift off at 2:24 p.m. EDT, heading to
orbit on a four-day mission 184 miles above Earth.
   Launch pad workers completed fueling early this morning. After
breakfast, the astronauts donned the bright orange launch suits
they would wear into space. They smiled and waved to NASA workers
as they headed to their beachfront launch pad.
   Magellan is to be released from Atlantis' cargo bay six hours
after launch and sent streaking on a 15-month, 806 million-mile
unmanned trip of its own.
   Mission specialists Mary Cleave and Mark Lee will operate remote
controls that propel Magellan from the shuttle's cargo bay.
Atlantis is commanded by David M. Walker. The other crew members
are pilot Ronald Grabe and mission specialist Norman Thagard.
   The liftoff opportunity, dictated by Magellan's path to Venus
and lighting conditions at emergency landing sites, lasts only 23
minutes, one of the shortest launch windows in shuttle history.
   After its release from the shuttle, Magellan's own rocket will
send it out of Earth orbit. Over the next 15 months, the craft will
fly around the sun 1{ times before settling into an orbit of Venus
in August 1990.
   Venus has intrigued humans as long as they've looked heavenward
and marveled at the universe. The planet, the familiar ``star'' of
the morning or evening, appears just before dawn or just after
sunset as a brilliant, unblinking point of light. Its brightness in
the nighttime sky is rivaled only by the moon.
   Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor, with an orbit 25.7 million
miles away, and the two often are considered to be sister planets
since they are about the same size. But the worlds differ mightily:
Dense clouds of carbon dioxide choke Venus, which has a surface
temperature of about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead.
   Magellan will be carrying some of the most sophisticated remote
mapping sensors ever sent to another planet.
   An imaging radar system will be able to detect features on the
surface as small as 100 yards, about the size of a football field.
The radar will be operated during almost 2,000 passes over the
Venusian surface, each time viewing a slice of the planet and then
sending the image back to Earth for computer enhancements.
   Magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of the surface
while orbiting Venus for about 243 Earth days, equal to a single
Venus day.
   The last U.S. planetary probe was the Pioneer-Venus, launched in
1978.
   Fisk said that in the 11 years since, ``we had a planetary
program that was in danger of being an also-ran.''
   Magellan is the first in a series of American planetary
exploration missions.
   Voyager 2, a probe launched in 1977 and an earlier visitor to
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, will fly past Neptune in August. In
October, the robot craft Galileo will be launched toward Jupiter. A
space telescope will be launched next year, followed by probes to
the sun in October 1990, and to Mars in 1992.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' Fisk said at a Thursday news conference.
   Its cloud cover blocks telescope views of Venus and until the
Space Age little was known about the planet's surface. Twenty space
probes have been sent to Venus, including four by the United
States, but only tiny fragments of the surface have been
photographed.
   Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist, said the Magellan
studies may help scientists understand how the Earth developed into
a place where life flourishes while Venus became a world of torrid
heat.

   A bedeviled, beleaguered NASA is hoping
the Magellan spacecraft's rendezvous with Venus next month will
provide our best look yet at Earth's hellishly hot neighbor.
   If all goes according to plan, the $413 million unmanned device,
centerpiece of a $744 million mission, will orbit the
cloud-shrouded planet on Aug. 10 after a 15-month journey from
Earth. And NASA desperately wants everything to go according to
plan.
   ``This thing must succeed because of the Hubble Space Telescope
effect and the generally bad impression we've all been getting of
how NASA has been conducting its affairs lately,'' said Steve
Saunders, the Magellan project's chief scientist.
   But those setbacks _ the crippling of the $1.5 billion Hubble
observatory due to mirror imperfections; the temporary grounding of
the space shuttles due to hydrogen fuel leaks _ have not dimmed the
agency's enthusiasm for Magellan.
   ``We've dreamed about the sights we would see. Now it's about to
happen,'' said Phil Allin, a Magellan project official at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Named for 16th century explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the craft's
radar will penetrate acid-laden Venusian clouds to make pictures
and maps 10 times more detailed than the best previous images.
   That will help geologists understand forces that sculpted Venus
to create flat lowlands, hilly plains and continent-like highlands
capped by peaks such as 35,400-foot Mount Maxwell, which is a mile
taller than Earth's Mount Everest.
   NASA says Magellan's radar will reveal unprecedented details of
the planet's terrain, a landscape shaped by meteorite craters, tens
of thousands of volcanoes, and perhaps movements of gargantuan
blocks of the planet's crust _ a process that may be similar to
continental drift on Earth.
   The 3.7-ton spacecraft also will look for ancient shorelines and
channels to learn if Venus once had oceans and rivers, before its
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped the sun's heat in a runaway
``greenhouse effect.''
   Such global warming makes modern Venus a bone-dry, 900-degree
Fahrenheit oven with an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than
Earth's.
   Magellan's mission ``is the capstone of the exploration of the
inner planets,'' said Jim Head, a member of the Magellan science
team and a geologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
   ``We've seen the surfaces of the moon, Mars, the Earth and
Mercury, but Venus always has been obscured by the clouds and we've
never gotten a good global view of it.''
   The 21-foot-long Magellan was released from the cargo bay of
space shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, then launched on its
roundabout, 806 million-mile voyage by an inertial upper-stage
rocket.
   At 9:31 a.m. PDT on Aug. 10, Magellan will fire its solid-fueled
Star rocket to slow down and go into a elliptical, nearly polar
orbit that ranges from 171 miles to almost 5,000 miles above Venus.
   After a few weeks of tests, the spacecraft will bounce radar
waves off Venus to make pictures and topographic maps of 70 percent
to 90 percent of the surface. Meanwhile, the planet will rotate
once on its axis during a single Venusian day, which equals 243
Earth days.
   ``It's going to give us a map of Venus that in many ways is
better than anything we have for the whole Earth,'' where most of
the ocean floor hasn't been mapped in detail, Saunders said.
   If scientists are lucky, Magellan may tell them if Venusian
volcanoes are active, if movements of the planet's crust produce
``Venus quakes,'' and if those movements are more like Earth's
drifting continents or like the upward boiling of molten rock that
created Hawaii.
   Venus is the planet most like Earth in terms of size, density
and mass, and also is Earth's nearest neighbor, other than the
moon. Yet its clouds prevent the surface from being seen by
telescopes or optical cameras aboard orbiting spaceships.
   About 20 spacecraft have visited Venus since the early 1960s,
some deploying landers that photographed small parts of the
surface. Pictures also were made by transmitting radar waves from
Earth, and from NASA's Pioneer Venus orbiter in 1978 and the Soviet
Union's Venera 15 and 16 orbiters in 1983.
   But the best radar pictures until now could distinguish only
those landscape features wider than about 1\ miles. Saunders said
Magellan's pictures will be roughly 10 times better, capturing
features as small as 260 yards, about the length of 2{ football
fields.
   Magellan will take 3 hours and 11 minutes to orbit Venus once.
During each orbit, Magellan will spend 37 minutes as it moves from
north to south bouncing radar off a swath of Venus' surface about
10,000 miles long but only 16 miles wide. The information will be
stored on two tape recorders.
   During the rest of each orbit, Magellan will radio the
information back to Earth, where it will be received by
230-foot-wide, dish-shaped antennas at NASA's Deep Space Network
stations in California, Spain and Australia.
   Computers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory will assemble the data
into pictures and topographic maps of each swath. The swaths _
nicknamed ``noodles'' because they are so long and narrow _ then
will be assembled into pictures covering larger areas of the planet.
   ``Mapping a whole new planet will return an enormous amount of
data that will keep geologists busy for a long time,'' Saunders
said. ``If you printed it in books, it would fill a shelf about 10
miles long. It's very humbling.''
   Magellan's main 243-day mapping mission will miss the south
polar regions. NASA is expected to approve more 243-day mapping
cycles. A total of three are needed to map the entire planet.
   Cost of the Magellan mission through the first 243-day mapping
cycle is $744 million, including the cost of launching the
spacecraft from the shuttle, said Bill Dimmer of NASA's
comptroller's office in Washington. The spacecraft and its
instruments account for $413 million of that total, he said.

<HEAD>Council Says U.S. Should Explore Use of Nuclear Power in Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Space explorers will have to use nuclear power
on Mars, and the National Science Council says the United States
should study employing nuclear rockets to get travelers to the
planet.
   In a Friday report to Vice President Dan Quayle, the council
acknowledged ``formidable barriers of public acceptance'' to the
use of nuclear power in space.
   However, it said the use of such power ``eventually will be
essential'' on both the Moon and Mars because of heavy energy
demands.
   It also recommended testing and possibly a demonstration in
space of the feasibility of sending rockets to Mars by nuclear
propulsion.
   The report analyzed a study done by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration as part of President Bush's initiative to put
bases on the Moon and Mars early in the next century.
   Among its findings:
   _NASA needs to study the effects of long-term space flight on
human beings because on the basis of present knowledge ``a
multiyear exposure to weightlessness, even with on-board exercise
and countermeasures and an intermediate stay on the surface of
Mars, presents unacceptable risks to the crew.''
   _Operation of a U.S. space station by the late 1990s as
scheduled is a ``reasonable assumption,'' but plans for the station
are not adequate for a Moon-Mars mission. The station ``may not be
the most appropriate staging base for the Moon and Mars'' and it is
possible that ``an additional station ... will eventually become
necessary.''
   _Although the NASA proposals envision bases on Mars, ``it
appears that a station in Mars orbit requires a less demanding
infrastructure than a surface base and might serve a useful purpose
in the early stages of human space exploration.''
   _Possibilities for international cooperation should be explored
because breakthroughs have been made in Europe, Japan and elsewhere
and ``most importantly, the USSR has substantial relevant
capability, demonstrated continued interest in Mars, and an
apparent strong desire for cooperation with the U.S. in Mars
exploration.''
   The council's study, made by a 14-member committee named in
January, said nuclear rockets would reach Mars in one-half to
one-third the time needed for single-stage chemical propulsion
systems. Unmanned spacecraft have made the 111 million mile voyage
to Mars in six months.
   ``The use of nuclear technology in space faces formidable
barriers of public acceptance, however, especially if employed in
Earth orbit,'' the council said. ``Therefore, issues of safety are
paramount in research and development.''
   It said one type of nuclear technology, known as the NERVA
class, ``is available for full-scale development'' and ``should be
evaluated for injection to Mars in competition with hydrogen-oxygen
chemical systems.''
   ``If careful systems studies ... show a significant advantage
for nuclear rockets in trip time or in weight to orbit, an in-space
demonstration of this technology should be done as soon as
possible,'' the council said.
   ``It will not be feasible to select the nuclear rocket as a
baseline in a system architecture until such a demonstration has
been conducted.''
   After announcing the Moon-Mars initiative July 20, the 20th
anniversary of the first Moon landing, Bush asked Quayle, chairman
of the National Space Council, to explore ways of carrying it out.
   NASA made a 90-day study, and Quayle asked the National Research
Council, an arm of the congressionally chartered National Academy
of Sciences, to evaluate it.

   Atlantis outwaited fickle weather
and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will
dispatch the Magellan probe to cloud-shrouded Venus for the best
look yet at Earth's nearest neighbor.
   The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the Florida sky
at 2:47 p.m. EDT, after being delayed a nail-biting 59 minutes by
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second
postponement in six days. NASA had 64 minutes in which to launch
today and used all but five minutes of that time.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger,'' said acting NASA administrator
Dale Meyers.
   The launch starts a 15-month journey of 806 million miles for
the robot explorer craft Magellan, the first American deep space
probe in 11 years. The $550 million craft, which had to be launched
by May 28 or wait two years, is carrying to Venus a powerful radar
system that will map most of the planet. Magellan is named for the
16th-century Portuguese explorer.
   Atlantis, riding a 700-foot cascade of flame, rose majestically
from its beachside launch pad into a blue, nearly cloudless sky,
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view.
   Two solid-fueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2
minutes, six seconds, precisely on schedule, and were jettisoned.
Atlantis flew on, powered by its liquid-fueled rockets.
   The successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers
earlier in the day. By late in the launch window, sea breezes had
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at
the Kennedy Space Center emergency landing site.
   NASA's first attempt to launch Atlantis last Friday was halted
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel
pump. Later, engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a
hydrogen fuel line. Both parts were replaced.
   The crew members for the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and
the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are commander David M.
Walker, pilot Ronald Grabe, and mission specialists Norman Thagard,
Mary Cleave and Mark Lee.
   Six hours after launch, Cleave and Lee operate remote controls
to eject Magellan from the shuttle's cargo bay. A powerful rocket
will then send Magellan out of Earth orbit and start it on a voyage
that will carry it 1{ times around the sun before reaching Venus.
   Atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above Earth
while the crew operates scientific experiments. Landing is set for
Monday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Today's launch opportunity was determined by the path Magellan
must follow to reach Earth's mysterious neighbor. If the launch had
been postponed, there would have been daily launch opportunities
until May 28. At that point, Earth and Venus would have moved out
of alignment and the Magellan mission would not be possible for two
years.
   Magellan marks the beginning of a new era in a U.S. planetary
exploration program that has not had a launch since 1978.
   Venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky.
It is the brightest object in the nighttime sky, except for the
moon. It appears in season as either the morning or the evening
``star,'' but Venus is actually a planet that orbits 67 million
miles from the sun. The Earth orbits 93 million miles from the sun.
   Scientists are intrigued by Venus because it is so close in size
to Earth, yet much different in most every other way. Venus rotates
the opposite direction of the Earth, which means the sun rises in
the west. Its rotation is so slow that a Venusian day lasts 243
Earth days.
   Venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be
seen by telescopes on Earth, giving the planet an aura of mystery.
   Space probes in recent years have proven that Venus' surface
temperature is about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. The
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures, with
high-altitude clouds of sulfuric acid.
   The torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the
planet, but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges, towering
volcanoes, and barren plains.
   Magellan will rendezvous with Venus in August 1990. It will
settle into an elongated orbit, sooping to within 155 miles of the
surface, and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5,000
miles.
   The 3{-ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give
the clearest picture yet of Venus. The radar is able to penetrate
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football
field.
   Magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of Venus. The radar
will operate during 2,000 passes over the planet, each time viewing
a slice of surface and sending the image back to Earth for computer
enhancement. The mapping expedition is expected to last about eight
months.
   Magellan is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks
what Lennard Fisk, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's chief scientist, called ``a resurgence of
America's planetary program.''
   Pioneer-Venus, in 1978, was the last U.S. space launch and Fisk
said America ``had a planetary program that was in danger of being
an also-ran.''
   Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will fly past Neptune in August. It
earlier visted Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. In October, the robot
craft Galileo will be launched toward Jupiter. A space telescope
will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in 1990,
and to Mars in 1992.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' said Fisk.

   NASA officials hope that a
disassembled spacecraft sitting in crates at a hangar Wednesday
will be en route to Venus by April as America's first
interplanetary explorer in 11 years.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration showed off the
scattered pieces of the Magellan spacecraft to reporters and
photographers four days after the spacecraft's arrival by truck
from the Martin Marietta plant in Denver.
   If all goes well, the parts will be assembled and checked out
over the next few months and then transported to the launch pad in
March to be loaded aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, said Jo Ann
Morgan, the Kennedy Space Center's director of payloads projects
management.
   The scheduled launch date is April 28.
   NASA will have only 25 days, until May 23, to get Atlantis off
the pad before Venus moves out of its favorable alignment with
Earth. Otherwise the Magellan voyage will have to be delayed about
two years, said Charles Brown, Magellan program manager for Martin
Marietta, which built the probe for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Once the shuttle is in orbit, the crew will release Magellan
from the cargo bay and a rocket will start it on the 466-day trip
to Venus.
   It will be the first planetary probe launched from a shuttle as
well as the first U.S. planetary mission since two Pioneer
spacecraft were dispatched in 1978 to study Venus' atmosphere.
   Magellan is to settle into an elliptical orbit around Venus
ranging from 155 miles to 1,180 miles above the surface. Each
circuit of the planet will take 3.1 days, and during the 40 minutes
the craft is nearest the surface, an advanced radar will peer
through the constant cloud layer and obtain images of the surface,
which will be relayed to an Earth station.
   During each orbit, the radar, supplied by Hughes Aircraft Co.,
will map a swath of surface 15 miles wide and 10,000 miles long.
Brown said it would take 1,853 such swaths, recorded over 243 days,
to chart the entire planet.
   ``The spacecraft will be conducting basic research about how
Venus was formed,'' Brown told a news conference. ``To find out, we
need to know the topography of the planet.
   ``We now have the topography of Earth, the moon, Mars and
Mercury, but we don't have the topography of Venus because of the
cloud cover,'' he said. ``The imaging radar will give us that
topography.''
   Brown said Magellan will enable scientists for the first time to
study detailed images of Venus like those formed by wind or flowing
liquid, craters and large landslides.
   While Venus is Earth's closest neighbor in the solar system, the
two planets are vastly different. Venus has a surface temperature
of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, its atmopshere is almost entirely
carbon dioxide, and its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of
Earth.
   Brown said one goal of the mission is to try to learn why the
two planets evolved so differently.

   WASHINGTON -- The current fight over the future of U.S.
space exploration may eventually yield a program that sets
the nation firmly on the course of a permanent presence in
space -- or a program that delays projects, wastes money and
in the end satisfies no one.
   At the heart of the controversy is the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's plan to build by the
end of the decade a $30 billion orbital space station manned
by four astronauts. The space station is central to the
administration's broader aim of using astronauts to explore
the solar system -- a goal that divides Congress and dismays
space scientists backing a variety of unmanned space --
science projects.

   True believers dominate the debate. Space exploration
requires "a leap of faith, above and beyond analysis," says
Richard Darman, the powerful White House budget director who
says he has believed since childhood that humans will someday
live on other planets. "Almost by personality type, you want
to press limits, press frontiers, or you don't."
   But many space scientists say manned expeditions are more
folly than frontier. Much of the effort in manned programs
goes into protecting astronauts from space hazards rather
than pushing the limits of technology, says Eugene Levy, head
of the University of Arizona's planetary program. He says
that sending unmanned spacecraft to Mars would cost far less
than the space station, and would do much more to advance
research in computers, robotics and communications.
   "These are the critical technologies in which Japan is
eating our lunch," he says.
   Scientists have been battling manned projects, without
much luck, since the beginning of the Space Age; President
Kennedy rejected the advice of his science adviser when he
decided to land a man on the moon. But the influence of
scientists has been growing steadily as first the space
shuttle, then the space station, ran into trouble from
spiraling costs and design flaws.
   Last December, a White House panel ranked unmanned
projects ahead of manned exploration as a goal for the space
program. Then, last month, an influential House
appropriations subcommittee voted to kill the space station
while preserving big increases for other forms of space
science. Space scientists were elated; James Van Allen, the
famed University of Iowa physicist who discovered the
radiation belts that ring the Earth, speaks for many of his
colleagues when he calls the station "a monster that will
kill off a lot of space science." Physicists, geologists,
chemists and astronomers all lobbied against the space
station.
   But during a House vote on the station earlier this month,
lawmakers who had ignored the space program for years rose to
defend not only the station but manned space expeditions,
too. Many of the lawmakers had been lobbied fiercely by the
White House and aerospace contractors; some also had NASA
centers or aerospace firms in their states. But the fervor of
their rhetoric indicated that they were moved as much by the
romance of space exploration -- and the memories of the
Apollo moon landings -- as by pork-barrel politics.
   "We are the first nation to effectively move into outer
space," said Republican Rep. Don Ritter of Pennsylvania, a
former engineering-school professor who supports the station.
"It is the pinnacle of America's national achievement." Added
Texas Democrat Jack Brooks, the Judiciary Committee chairman,
whose district includes the Johnson Space Center: "The future
of the universe is in space."
   The House finally voted 240-173 to build the station, but
at the cost of freezing all NASA projects at their current
levels. The biggest loser was space science, which had been
slated to receive big increases for an X-ray space telescope,
two unmanned spacecraft to explore Saturn and a comet, and a
satellite project to study the Earth's climate.
   The vote didn't resolve the dispute over space priorities;
it just made the battle more bitter. The White House and NASA
promise they will lobby to restore science funds in the
Senate. But the comet mission will probably be canceled,
congressional and NASA officials say, and the others face
substantial cutbacks and delays before they reach the launch
pad. The agency's plans to build an infrared space telescope
and launch an unmanned probe to the sun are also in limbo.
"If we get pushed hard enough, we'll have to reassess all the
{science} programs," says NASA chief Richard Truly.
   John Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., who organized opposition
to the station, says he's bewildered by NASA's willingness to
sacrifice science projects. "If NASA were a mental patient
instead of an agency, you'd say it has schizophrenia," he
says. Mr. Darman, the budget director, contends that station
opponents want to protect their research grants, not help the
space program. "They're not engaged in big-think," he says.
   Alex Roland, a Duke University space historian, says he
sees a disturbing parallel between the current battle and the
one a decade ago over the space shuttle. Then, NASA slashed
spending for a series of science missions to conserve funds
for the shuttle. Between mid-1978 and mid-1989, for instance,
the U.S. didn't launch a single planetary probe. With
continuing budget constraints, Mr. Roland says NASA will be
forced to make similar sacrifices to build the station. He
calls the space station "the son of shuttle."
   This time, though, not only science will lose, but
exploration too, warns Michigan Democratic Rep. Robert
Traxler, who heads the appropriations panel that tried and
failed to kill the station. Indeed, so far, Congress has
shown no willingness to fund the expensive propulsion
technologies that the administration says are crucial if
astronauts are ever to go beyond the station and off to Mars.
Rep. Traxler calls the administration's exploration plans "an
enormously expensive fantasy which will have severe adverse
effects on domestic programs."
   Not at all, says Mr. Darman. He insists the administration
is committed to preventing the station from cannibalizing the
rest of the space program; one idea being explored is the
creation of a space trust fund, modeled on the interstate
highway trust fund, to pay for construction in space.
("There's no funding source, so it's not a viable idea yet,"
the budget director concedes.)
   Mostly, though, Mr. Darman counsels faith. The space
station is just the first small step in manned exploration of
the solar system, he says. Station astronauts will explore
the effects of weightlessness on materials, themselves and
other living organisms. After that, other uses for the space
station will emerge -- and with them an even broader
political constituency for manned exploration. "People's
earthly interests will grow and grow," he prophesies.

President Bush, charting a course for an American return to space exploration, 
Thursday challenged the nation to commit itself to a permanent manned presence 
in space and, in the next century, to send a manned spaceship to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing, Bush said the 
Apollo astronauts "left more than flags and footprints on the moon. They also 
left some unfinished business." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the United States must begin a journey "back to the moon, back to the 
future, and this time, back to stay." 
</P>
<P>
But, although Bush threw his support solidly behind a pending $30-billion 
program to launch a manned space station called Freedom, the President stopped 
short of advocating specific timetables or budgets for more distant space 
exploration targets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quayle to Work Out Details 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bush directed Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National 
Space Council, to work out the details. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's address, delivered on the steps of the Smithsonian Institution's Air and 
Space Museum, apparently helped head off a serious political defeat for the 
space program in Congress. Acting just hours later, the House rejected an 
attempt to strike $714 million from the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration's budget for the space station program. 
</P>
<P>
The scuttled amendment, proposed during House debate on a 1990 appropriation 
bill, would have shifted the money to medical programs for veterans, pollution 
control efforts and housing assistance. The House Appropriations Committee 
already had cut $400 million from the $2 billion sought by the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints About Expense 
</P>
<P>
But Bush's speech drew a cautious response from lawmakers, who complained that 
the space station alone has proven too expensive for a Congress already under 
intense fiscal pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the federal budget deficit and earthly demands, I don't see how we can 
afford expensive manned programs in space in the near future," said Rep. Bill 
Green (R-N.Y.), ranking Republican on the House subcommittee that funds NASA. 
</P>
<P>
"People also dream of a home in the country or a trip around the world," Green 
said, "but like couples with big mortgages and kids in college, this country 
has bills to pay before taking costly adventures." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the President, Michael Collins, the astronaut who commanded the 
Apollo spaceship 20 years ago while his fellow astronauts walked on the moon, 
defended the space program in the face of competing national priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot launch our planetary probes from a springboard of poverty, 
discrimination or unrest," Collins said. "But neither can we wait until each 
and every terrestrial problem has been solved. Such logic 200 years ago would 
have prevented expansion westward of the Appalachian Mountains, for assuredly 
the Eastern Seaboard was beset by problems of great urgency then, as it is 
today." 
</P>
<P>
NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly said his agency has devised no firm cost 
estimates for the more ambitious goals advocated by the President. But 
independent experts have said that an aggressive program designed to establish 
a permanent moon presence and to launch a manned Mars probe could cost $30 
billion to $35 billion annually, almost doubling current expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the budgets will turn out to be, but I can assure you that 
they are very affordable, I believe, in the total context and over a long 
period of time," Truly said. 
</P>
<P>
Truly said that earlier independent space commissions have called for such 
undertakings as the manned exploration of Mars and the establishment of a 
permanent research station on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"Until this morning, we really have not had a President who laid out in broad 
terms his view and his series of goals so that the Space Council and NASA can 
flesh them out," Truly said. 
</P>
<P>
In advocating a return to the moon and an eventual mission to Mars, Bush 
appears to have seized the initiative from the Soviet Union. For years, those 
programs have been long-term goals of Soviet scientists and space officials, 
said Nicholas L. Johnson, an advisory scientist with Teledyne-Brown Engineering 
and an expert on the Soviet space program. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the nation's first space priority is the space station, which would 
be lofted into orbit in phases, beginning in 1995. He called the future 
spacecraft "a new bridge between the worlds and an investment in the growth, 
prosperity and technical superiority of our nation." 
</P>
<P>
The President and NASA officials also emphasized the space station's role in 
researching earthly problems, such as global warming, also known as the 
greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The space station will also serve as a steppingstone to the most important 
planet in the solar system, Planet Earth," Bush said.

   There was a collective national "frisson" when JFK
announced in the early 1960s that the U.S. would put a man on
the moon by the end of the decade. When President Bush
announced recently that he wanted to reach Mars by 2019, the
response was far from deafening. There was some discussion,
there were some magazine covers -- but no true universal
cheer.
   Americans now are not looking toward the stars. They are
looking at a burgeoning federal deficit and other hard fiscal
realities. Americans also have seen our country's grand
scientific achievements either perish in a ball of flame (the
Challenger disaster) or end in grotesque failure (the Hubble
Telescope's imitation of Mr. Magoo). This is why an excellent
book such as "Mars Beckons" (Knopf, 244 pages, $24.95) by
John Noble Wilford still gives one mixed emotions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Wilford, a science correspondent for the New York
Times, paints a picture that is pleasing to our adventurous
eye. But one can't help but be seized by the skepticism of
the present day, for it will be quite hard to slip the surly
financial bonds that stricture America's expeditionary
yearnings.
   Yet Mr. Wilford sounds the theme of inevitability in his
book: "Humans will go forth to Mars. In the next two or three
decades perhaps, in the twenty-first century almost
certainly, astronauts will make the long journey," he writes.
"They may be Americans or Russians, traveling separately or
together, and they may be Europeans, Chinese, and Japanese as
well. Their journeys should be only the beginning of human
expansion out into the solar system."
   We will go to Mars, he argues, in part because of our
ancient fascination with the Red Planet, and he chronicles
its appeal through the ages at the beginning of "Mars
Beckons." In a sweeping preamble, the reader is taken to the
very beginning of Martian studies, a study first steeped in
astrological mysticism that then grew and matured as the
scientific mind matured.
   Mars was an object of awe for the ancients in Mesopotamia,
an object of scientific study for the likes of astronomers
Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler and Percival Lowell and an
object of fear exploited by H.G. Wells and Orson Welles. We
have always had this longing for some sort of life on Mars.
We've always wanted more than an echo when we gave a call
across space. Our fanciful visions of Martian canals,
beautiful Martian women and advanced Martian civilizations
stayed with us -- right up until the point we went there.
   His Martian history lesson concluded, Mr. Wilford shows us
the long path to Martian exploration. After years of spinning
Martian yarns and peering through telescopes, we finally
reached Mars with The Little Spacecraft That Could -- Mariner
4. His description of the craft, which reached Mars in 1965,
brings to mind an old piece of intricately spun Steuben:
"Simple and small . . . The solar blades shone purple from
the thin sapphire-glass coating . . . the craft's silvery
octagonal body . . . carried 138,000 delicate instruments . .
."
   Soviet and American Martian exploration had been checkered
by many failures before Mariner 4, prompting American
planetary engineers to imagine a "Great Galactic Ghoul" that
ate spacecraft. But the pictures Mariner 4 sent back showed
no canals, no ancient civilizations, no beautiful women, not
even a small ghoul.
   Even so, we went forward, with more orbiters, with robotic
landers. But the ultimate goal, the goal that Mr. Wilford is
very excited about, is a manned mission to Mars. "The time
for decision is at hand," insists Mr. Wilford. The end of the
Cold War and growing pro-Mars sentiment are cited as two
reasons why we can explore the Red Planet. The entire world
-- America, the Soviet Union, Europe, Asia -- should take
part in the exploration of this red world. And soon, too. A
perfect date to announce these grand plans, he thinks, would
be in 1992, the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's
discovery of the New World, a feat that required great
fortitude.
   But Columbus had to sail over the edge of the world; we
now have to sail beyond it. How we can do it technically is
discussed in depth in "Mars Beckons."
   But what is lacking in the book is a true sense of the
political and financial barriers to the Martian endeavor. Mr.
Wilford cites the rhetoric of politicians, the supposed
willingness of the Soviets to cooperate, the technological
capacity of the present day and the technological progress of
the near future as foundations for a Mars mission.
   One wants to believe in Mr. Wilford's vision, like a
sinner wishing for salvation at a church revival. But
reality, like Old Scratch, always seems to ruin things.
Budget negotiators continually eye NASA's budget hungrily.
NASA isn't playing it smart in this day of fiscal crunch --
its reliance on huge, expensive projects prone to failure
(Hubble, the proposed Space Station Freedom) has not endeared
the space agency to Congress or the American people. The
clamor over AIDS, the environment and the homeless, among
other things, drowns out the discussion about Mars. The
debate over whether the U.S. should support "big science"
projects like the Space Station or whether we should support
smaller, less ambitious and less costly endeavors dominates
discourse nowadays -- and present reality seems to be tilting
us toward smaller projects.
   Yet, Mr. Wilford offers us a compelling vision of our
past, present and (hopefully) future with Mars. He obviously
is excited about our future: Someone should set this book to
the tune of "Blue Danube." "The call to Mars," he writes,
"echoes through centuries of human history." The grand vision
of setting foot upon Mars is tantalizing, but our present
problems threaten to muffle and drown out this ancient call
to explore.

<HEAD>Scientists See Little Chance to Regain Contact with Mars Probe</HEAD>

   Officials worked around the clock Wednesday to
restore contact with a space probe circling the Martian moon
Phobos, but hopes were fading that they could save the $500 million
project.
   A commission has been formed to determine the cause of the
failure of Phobos II and present its conclusions in a week, said
Sergei Zavgorodny, an official at Glavkosmos, the Soviet space
agency.
   In an interview with the newspaper Izvestia, Glavkosmos head
Alexander Dunayev said scientists were awaiting the commission's
findings before taking further action.
   Scientists at Moscow's Space Research Institute, which developed
the project to explore Mars and Phobos, its biggest moon, met
throughout the day Wednesday.
   One expert emerged and gave a gloomy assessment of the future of
the spacecraft, whose companion probe Phobos I became lost in space
in September after a ground controller sent an erroneous computer
command.
   ``The situation is bad and honestly, there are fewer and fewer
hopes. Chances to regain contact with the probe are very small,''
said Alexander Zakharov, a project scientist.
   A Soviet TV commentator suggested that Western news reports
claiming the problem was ``catastrophic'' were exagerrated and
cited successful studies by the craft of solar radiation and the
surface of Mars itself conducted before the communication failure.
   The report on the evening news program ``Vremya'' featured
detailed maps of the Martian surface compiled photos taken by the
spacecraft.
   Ground control has received sporadic radio signals from the
spacecraft, an unmanned spacecraft launched in July, but no regular
contact, he said.
   Izvestia said the problem occurred Monday when ground
controllers were trying to reorient the spacecraft to take
photographs of the Martian moon. After the maneuver, it said,
controllers were unable to contact the craft despite repeated
attempts.
   Dunayev said there were seven or eight possibilities as to why
communications failed. He did not elaborate, and efforts to reach
him were unsuccessful.
   Loss of Phobos II would be a severe setback for the $480 million
international Phobos project led by the Soviet Union. Twenty-two
countries and the European Space Agency have contributed technology
or experiments to the project, and the United States was helping
track the two craft with NASA's Deep Space Network.
   Loss of communications apparently would prevent Phobos II from
dropping two small landing craft onto the surface of the Martian
moon. Soviet news reports in January said the spacecraft was to
approach the moon next month to analyze its soil with a laser and
then release two landers.
   Roger Bonnet, science director of the Paris-based European Space
Agency, said ``there is some hope'' of regaining contact with
Phobos II. ``It's not zero,'' he added in an interview.
   ``It's a disappointment. But the Mars phase was a great success.
We obtained unique information on the surface of Mars, its
atmosphere, its magnetic field and its environment,'' Bonnet said.
   In Washington, NASA spokesman Jeff Vincent said the Soviets had
not asked the United States for help but that the agency's tracking
network is monitoring the craft. ``There is nothing we can do for
them,'' he said.
   Tass announced Jan. 30 that Phobos II went into orbit around
Mars the previous day after a six-month, 111 million-mile voyage
from Earth and was studying the planet's climate and soil.
   Soviet space officials have said the mission would help them
prepare a manned mission to Mars early in the 21st century.
   Phobos II was launched July 12 in a program to unlock mysteries
of the red planet and Phobos, Tass said. In December, Tass said
some instruments aboard Phobos II failed, but most were fixed and
the problems would not prevent the completion of its program.
   Phobos I was lost only three months after it was launched July
7, and ground controllers have been unable to communicate with it.

   A Soviet space official said today that a ground
control operator sent an incorrect message to a Soviet space probe
bound for Mars, and the unmanned spacecraft is now worthless.
   ``Only a miracle can save it,'' Roald Z. Sagdeyev, head of the
Soviet Space Research Institute, said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   Earlier, the official Tass news agency announced that ground
control had lost communications contact with the Phobos 1 probe,
which is millions of miles from Earth and racing toward a
rendezvous with the planet Mars.
   The Phobos 1 mishap follows a foul-up earlier in the week that
delayed the landing of a Soviet space capsule carrying a Soviet and
an Afghan cosmonaut.
   The unmanned Mars probe, Phobos 1, was launched July 7, and a
twin spacecraft, Phobos 2, on July 12.
   The probes were scheduled to go into orbit around Mars and in
January drop behind Phobos, the larger of the Red Planet's two
moons, to study the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field.
   Sagdeyev, however, said that a ground control operator at the
Soviet Mission Control Center near Moscow sent an incorrect command
to Phobos 1 during the night of Aug. 29-30 that left the spacecraft
``sleeping'' and ``frozen.''
   He said the mistake was discovered three days later and that
ground control operators were trying to correct the problem by
sending new commands to Phobos 1. But the spacecraft was not
responding, he said.
   Sagdeyev said the probe could virtually be written off as a
total loss.
   The Soviet space research chief spoke to a reporter during an
afternoon reception at the U.S. ambassador's residence in honor of
Andrei D. Sakharov, the Soviet physicist and human rights activist
who is the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   Tass, in its report, indicated that Soviet space officials had
not had any contact with Phobos 1 for at least a week.
   ``In the two months that elapsed after the blastoff, the space
probes performed 75 radio communications sessions during which
measurings of trajectory parameters were made and operation on
onboard systems and scientific equipment was monitored,'' Tass said.
   ``On Sept. 2, another planned session of radio communication
with the Phobos 1 station failed to materialize,'' Tass said. ``At
that time, the station was 17 million kilometers (10.5 million
miles) from the Earth. On Sept. 9 (today), it was 19 million
kilometers (11.8 million miles) from the Earth.''
   Phobos 1 was supposed to navigate with a NASA navigation system,
and a NASA official, Raymond J. Amorose, said Thursday the Soviets
notified the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that
they had lost contact with the craft.
   Tass indicated that scientists were in normal contact with
Phobos 2, and said today it was 11.8 million miles from Earth.
   ``According to transmitted information, onboard systems and
instrumentation of the Phobos 2 station function smoothly,'' it
said.
   Regarding the Soviet space capsule, the state-run Soviet press
said both equipment problems and errors by the Soviet flight
commander, Vladimir Lyakhov, forced a postponement of the scheduled
Tuesday landing of the Soyuz TM-5 capsule. The spacecraft, also
carrying Afghanistan's first man in space, Ahad Abdul Mohmand,
landed safely Wednesday on its third attempt.

MARS MISSION POSES PROBLEMS BUT HAS POSSIBLY BIG REWARDS

<P>
President Bush's goal of sending a manned expedition to Mars within 30 years 
poses unprecedented scientific and technological challenges but it also may 
lead to new insights into human and planetary evolution -- and perhaps even to 
material returns. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the obstacles is the debilitating, and possibly fatal, effects of 
prolonged exposure to zero gravity. 
</P>
<P>
But a Mars mission also would require more durable and lighter-weight building 
materials, better ways to protect spacecraft from debris and astronauts from 
radiation and -- above all -- more powerful rockets, perhaps nuclear-fueled, 
capable of launching massive vehicles and their components to the distant 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, it's a much larger challenge than going to the moon," said John E. 
Pike, associate director for space policy at the Federation of American 
Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, however, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is 
studded with minerals such as cobalt, nickel and platinum that, if mined, could 
be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. "Those materials are available to the 
first nation that gets there," said one scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Close-up studies of Mars' surface and atmosphere also may provide new 
understanding of the basic forces that govern the solar system's evolution and 
possible signs of whether life ever existed there. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, astronomy conducted from Mars would be able to explore the cosmos 
with hundreds of thousands of times greater clarity than previously possible -- 
the new orbiting Hubble Space Telescope notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, there are some political realities to be dealt with on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen if the Democratic Congress -- at a time of whopping 
deficits and rising interest rates -- will go along with the mission's 
estimated price tag of $500 billion. President Bush did not mention the 
projected cost in either of his two major speeches on Mars, the most recent on 
Friday in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The technological challenges may be more formidable. 
</P>
<P>
One current NASA scenario calls for Mars-going spacecraft to be assembled at 
the orbiting $30-billion space station, which the space agency hopes to 
complete around the turn of the century. Such spaceships might then shuttle 
between Earth and Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing travel time looms as the central challenge to a human mission to Mars 
because of the deleterious effects of zero gravity on astronauts. NASA 
scientists believe nuclear-powered rockets might reduce the one-way trip from a 
year to several months. 
</P>
<P>
But whether such an advanced technology is feasible is "too speculative" for 
now, according to scientists at the George C. Marshall Institute, a science 
think tank in Washington. "No element of research in preparation for the 
missions is more important," they said in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
The withering effect of prolonged weightlessness on bones and muscles were 
strikingly demonstrated when two Soviet cosmonauts returned to Earth after more 
than a year in orbit: They had enormous difficulty walking -- despite having 
exercised strenuously each day they lived in space. 
</P>
<P>
Experiments in the U.S. Skylab suggest that loss of bone mass could amount to 
30% during a two-year round trip to Mars, leaving the legs and spine 
dangerously fragile. Other tests have shown that serious immune deficiency 
could develop, while calcium loss could cause kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
According to Marshall's scientists, NASA acknowledges the importance of the 
zero-gravity problem but the agency has yet to recognize the need to conduct 
research and development into artificial gravity as a possible solution. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said, the hazards of prolonged zero-gravity would be 
exacerbated by the spacecraft's rapid deceleration upon arrival at Mars. The 
sudden braking could put severe stress on the crew's weakened cardiac systems 
and skeletal structures. 
</P>
<P>
The Marshall scientists called for creation of a presidential commission, made 
up of experts from academia, industry and government, to oversee the mission.

   It doesn't think like C-3PO or R2D2, but this
robot can amble along the rocky surfaces of Mars or the moon as
well as any ``Star Wars'' machine did in a galaxy far, far away.
   Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University unveiled the prototype
Thursday. Nicknamed the ``Ambler'' by the team that has been
working on it since October 1987, the aluminum robot stands 12 feet
tall and has paired stacks of three legs that enable it to traverse
uneven terrain.
   ``A walking robot was needed as an alternative to the
traditional line of wheeled rovers,'' said David B. Lavery, manager
of the Planetary Rovers program at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   ``What we want to do is demonstrate that legged vehicles ...
have an acceptable place,'' he said. ``I think the Ambler has
successfully done that.''
   William L. Whittaker, one of three Carnegie Mellon robotics
experts heading the project, said the robot moves like a
cross-country skier.
   ``A single leg reaches out in front of the others, places itself
firmly on the ground like a ski pole and then pulls the machine
forward,'' he said.
   Robots using Ambler technology are slated for use in a series of
mechanized missions to Mars, Lavery said. He estimated walking
robots could be on the Martian surface by the end of the decade.
   President Bush last week set a deadline of 2019 for Americans to
walk on Mars. The date is 50 years after Neil Armstrong, Michael
Collins and Buzz Aldrin first landed on the moon.
   The Ambler, which recently took its first steps, is one project
being evaluated by the NASA rovers program, Lavery said. The other
projects under consideration are all wheeled rovers, he said.
   ``The intent for the vehicles ... is for them to be capable of
operating on their own with just a very general set of
directions,'' he said.
   That objective has been met in the Ambler, according to Takeo
Kanade, Whittaker's associate.
   ``Our goal is basically to demonstrate that actual exploration
of planets is possible,'' Kanade said.
   The Ambler has the ability to assess its environment, make
decisions, move and interact with or manipulate objects, he said.
   ``The Ambler is one of very few systems that embody all four
capabilities,'' he said.
   Kanade, who serves as co-director of Carnegie Mellon's Robotics
Institute, said the Ambler prototype will never go into space. But
the robot's technology should be ready for space flight within a
decade.
   Meantime, Kanade envisions other uses for the technology.
   ``It's not just the very narrow, kind of strange applications of
space exploration. It has a very broad impact,'' he said.
   Independent walking robots designed to adapt to a variety of
environments could be used for construction projects on the moon
and to clean up hazardous waste on Earth, he said.
   ``These machines will have to contend with rugged and soft
terrain, low temperatures, high winds, dust and equipment
failure,'' Kanade said. ``These are robots that work in
environments that are not traditionally designed for robots.
   ``The impact of this kind of program is phenomenal.''
   Kanade said the university has spent $4.5 million in NASA grants
to develop the Ambler.

<HEAD>Apollo Astronauts Celebrate 20th Anniversary of Moon Landing</HEAD>

   Twenty years after the first moon
walk, the Apollo 11 crew called for further exploration of the lunar
surface and Mars, but another astronaut said a bold new program is
unlikely soon.
   Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins, at a ceremony
Sunday commemorating the anniversary of their spectacular liftoff on
July 16, 1969, expressed their hopes for a rejuvenated space program.
   On Thursday, the anniversary of the landing, they will join with
President Bush for a celebration outside the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C.
   There, Bush will deliver a speech on space policy. Some are
pressing him to announce a return to the moon, while others are
pushing for an exploration to Mars. Many scientists are suggesting a
joint U.S.-Soviet exploration for either option.
   Bush said in Paris on Sunday he was weighing different ideas.
   At Cape Canaveral, Armstrong, told 6,000 flag-waving space
workers and their families Sunday that they should ``allow ourselves
just a touch of pride, a touch of satisfaction, that we were
participants and witnesses to the birth of a new human era.''
   He said historians in future centuries will identify the 20th
century ``as the time when the human species broke the bonds of
gravity that had heretofore bound them to this planet.''
   In brief remarks, Aldrin, who walked on the moon with Armstrong,
and Collins, who remained in lunar orbit in the command ship, looked
to future space exploration.
   ``One of these years, and I hope it won't be too long, this
country will decide to press on again far out into space, perhaps to
the planet Mars,'' Collins said.
   Aldrin said NASA's Freedom space station, to be assembled in
orbit in the mid-1990s, should serve as a stepping stone to a manned
lunar base and human flights to Mars.
   He called President John F. Kennedy's commitment to the moon
landing goal 28 years ago ``a starter's gun for our pioneering giant
leap for mankind.''
   ``We're not yet ready for that go again. But perhaps we are at
the starting line, prepared to take our marks or get set,'' Aldrin
said.
   Following the ceremony, the astronauts rode in a
20-mile-motorcade from the space center to Cocoa Beach, where they
attended a luncheon in their honor. An estimated 10,000 people lined
the route to cheer the spacemen and to take pictures.
   For Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins, the ceremony was the second
stop on a week-long sentimental journey that began Saturday with a
visit to the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., where
their Saturn 5 rocket was designed.
   In Huntsville on Sunday, Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean had a more
pessimistic view of space exploration in the near future.
   Bean, the fourth man to walk on the moon, said that until the
Soviet Union decides to put a man on the moon or take some other
such step, Americans will be complacent about their space
achievements.
   ``Sometime something will happen where we'll say maybe we'd
better catch up. But that won't happen today,'' Bean said.
   Bean, who walked on the moon on Nov. 19, 1969, and later flew
aboard Skylab 3 for 59 days in 1973, said he didn't want to see
another 1960s-style space race.
   ``I'd rather have space cooperation. I'd think that would be much
better for the Earth,'' he said.

<P>
Turning away from a capital immersed in its latest budget battle, President 
Bush on Friday set his sights on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
He renewed his commitment to landing Americans on the planet -- and for the 
first time set a public deadline for the mission: July 20, 2019, the 50th 
anniversary of the first moon landing by U.S. astronauts in the Apollo space 
program. But he did not say how the multibillion-dollar centerpiece of his new 
"Age of Exploration" would be financed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to open up the final frontier. There can be no turning back," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that before Apollo celebrates the 50th anniversary of its landing on 
the moon, the American flag should be planted on Mars," the President said in a 
commencement address at Texas A&amp;I University here. 
</P>
<P>
While the President's deadline for a landing on Mars does not amount to a firm 
commitment to spend the necessary billions of dollars that will be needed to 
achieve the goal -- that commitment can be accomplished only with the 
cooperation of Congress -- his fiscal 1991 budget has asked for a 24% increase 
in spending for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the largest 
increase in funding for any major government agency next year. Under the 
President's plan, NASA would receive $15.2 billion in the fiscal year beginning 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's renewed focus on Mars, and space exploration in general, reflects a 
commitment he made last July 20, on the 20th anniversary of man's arrival on 
the moon, to return America to the business of space exploration and to send a 
manned spaceship to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, however, he set no timetables or budgets for the Mars mission, 
directing Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, to 
work out the details. 
</P>
<P>
The President also has set a goal of placing an operating space station in 
permanent orbit around Earth by the end of the century as the first step toward 
a permanent manned presence in space. He called for establishing sometime 
afterward a manned laboratory on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
The Mars mission would cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next three 
decades -- one estimate has it costing $30 billion to $35 billion annually -- 
and would culminate in a dangerous space voyage of two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
Asked aboard Air Force One as he was about to leave Washington for Texas 
whether the United States could indeed reach his Mars goal in 30 years, he 
replied: "You have to go fairly fast. It's a long way out there." 
</P>
<P>
As for where the money would come from, he replied, "Thirty years is a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The risks of the journey are awesome: The astronauts' spaceship could collide 
with a meteoroid that could cause rapid decompression -- and death; violent 
storms on the surface of the sun could blast them with deadly radiation, if 
their craft is unprotected, and the team could be forced to spend a year on 
Mars, waiting for the planet to be aligned properly with Earth to allow them to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
For his speech Friday, Bush chose a 65-year-old university in the southern tip 
of Texas, a state heavily involved with the aerospace industry. Texas A&amp;I 
has an enrollment of nearly 6,000 students, 57% of whom are Latino. It 
graduated 407 students Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the nation's renewed commitment to exploration of space -- and 
his related plan to use space vehicles to better chart conditions on Earth, 
including changes in climate -- would generate widespread benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Our space program will help rekindle public interest in science and 
mathematics and revitalize an area of our educational system that has become 
disturbingly weak," the President said. "It will revolutionize everything from 
computers to communications, from medicine to metals, regaining and retaining 
America's high-tech competitive edge. It will create new technologies, new 
industries and new jobs." 
</P>
<P>
While the mission to Mars is the most dramatic element in Bush's overall space 
policy, the program dubbed "Mission to Planet Earth" is geared to produce more 
immediate results. 
</P>
<P>
It is intended to use satellites with a new array of sensors to measure sea and 
land temperatures, deforestation, and other elements in the phenomenon known as 
global warming over a period of several years.

<HEAD>The Last Flyby: Voyager 2 Closes In On Distant Neptune</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A robot explorer named Voyager 2 flies
past Neptune this week for its dazzling last picture show _ the
final photo opportunity during the spacecraft's four-planet, 4.4
billion-mile odyssey.
   ``We're getting close, everything is working extremely well and
we're all excited,'' said Norm Haynes, Voyager project manager at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The surf is definitely up here at JPL,'' joked Franklin
O'Donnell, a spokesman for the lab where about 170 scientists from
around the world are asembling for the critical period.
   Coincidentally, Sunday was the 12th anniversary of Voyager 2's
launch from Florida on Aug. 20, 1977.
   The researchers will share ultimate exhilaration as front-row
observers for humanity's first close-up look at the solar system's
fourth-largest planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times Earth's
diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
Neptune encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a U.S.
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: Magellan
at Venus, Galileo at Jupiter and the Mars Observer.
   And with no one planning a mission to Pluto, Neptune is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from Earth in
the foreseeable future.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like Marco Polo,
Magellan and Columbus,'' said Jurrie van der Woude, a JPL spokesman.
``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Only a few days and a few million miles remain until 8:59 p.m.
PDT Thursday, when Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloudtops _ much closer than
its encounters with Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in
1986.
   As of 9 a.m. PDT Monday, Voyager 2 will be 2.743 billion miles
from Earth and 3.211 million miles from Neptune, approaching the
planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in 1977, Voyager 2 has
traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With a final course correction Monday morning, NASA engineers
will put Voyager 2 on its precise trajectory for the Neptune flyby.
   Sending Voyager to Neptune was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,'' says
``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide'' by mission planning manager
Charles Kohlhase and his staff.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments will pour in so quickly
that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct
daily news conferences starting Monday and continuing through Aug.
29.
   By late last week, Voyager had already revealed some of Neptune's
secrets, including:
   _Four previously unknown moons, in addition to Nereid and
backward-orbiting Triton, which were discovered from Earth. Voyager
is likely to discover more moons.
   _Clouds and other weather features, including 2,700-mile-wide
bands similar to jet streams on Earth, and a 8,100-by-4,100-mile
dark spot, probably a huge storm like Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
   _Two partial rings of debris, called ring arcs, that are much
different from the complete rings that encircle Saturn and Uranus.
Scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting Neptune.
   _A magnetic field surrounding Neptune, suggesting the planet also
may have auroras like Earth's northern lights and may be enveloped
by orbiting radiation belts similar to Earth's Van Allen belts.
   The Neptune encounter is the climax of the $865 million,
twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw Voyager 1 explore
Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   Haynes said Monday's course correction will assure Voyager 2 can
aim a radio signal at Earth when the probe starts to pass behind
Neptune.
   Ellis Miner, deputy project scientist, said by measuring changes
in the signal, scientists hope to determine Neptune's atmospheric
pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup; whether ring arcs are
made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and how material is
distributed inside Neptune.
   The radio experiment takes all of Voyager's radio signal
strength, so no other data or photographs will be sent back to Earth
for about 2{ hours around the time of close encounter, Miner said.
When Voyager sends pictures and data to Earth, they take four hours
and six minutes to arrive, even traveling at the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second.
   During its closest encounter with Neptune, Voyager will pass over
the planet's north pole, which will be cloaked in winter darkness.
Six minutes later, Voyager will start a 49-minute trip through
Neptune's shadow. Instead of photographing Neptune during those
times, the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures
of any ring arcs and of one of the newly discovered moons.

   If President Bush, in his Apollo anniversary
speech on Thursday, hands NASA the job of sending Americans back to
the moon and on to Mars, Congress will first have to provide the
billions to rebuild a much-weakened space agency.
   ``Today's NASA can't do it,'' said the agency's administrator,
Richard Truly, last week.
   Since the heyday of Apollo, which put 12 Americans on the moon in
the late 1960s and the early 1970s, NASA's work force has shrunk by
14,000 from 36,000. The managers of Apollo are retiring or have
gone; in recent months many of the top officials have resigned.
   The space agency's contractor force, which builds the
sophisticated equipment needed for such a venture, also is down from
a peak of 400,000 in the Apollo days to slightly more than 100,000
today.
   For any of the goals the president is likely to set, a space
station is a bottom line necessity and there has been considerable
opposition in Congress for spending the $30 billion that alone will
require.
   During Apollo the nation spent between 4 percent and 5 percent of
its federal budget on space. Bush has asked Congress for $13.3
billion next year _ about 1 percent of the $1.16 trillion for 1990.
   ``To do these kinds of programs, the NASA budget would have to
increase by a factor of two at the minimum, and possibly a little
higher,'' said Frank Martin, head of the NASA Office of Exploration.
He estimated space spending would quickly climb to $30 billion a
year to land men on Mars in 2020.
   Martin's office outlined four potential manned expeditions late
last year, two of them involving moon bases, one establishing a Mars
outpost and the other a base on the Martian moon Phobos.
   One of the moon bases would not be permanently staffed, serving
chiefly as an astronomy laboratory where telescopes _ free of
Earth's atmosphere _ could study the most distant galaxies and
search for life. The base would be serviced by visiting astronauts
every every three years.
   The second base, on the front side of the moon, would be manned
permanently.
   Many astronaut crews would be required to construct an
Antarctic-type facility, using lunar soil that is rich in metals and
silicon which could be mixed with water to form a kind of cement.
   Oxygen, which can be extracted from rocks on the moon, could be
mixed with hydrogen brought from Earth to provide water and also
supply rocket fuel for Mars or other space expeditions.
   NASA has studied two approaches for exploring Mars: one using
humans, the other a robot capable of moving around the surface. A
combination of those two would place astronauts on Phobos to guide
the rover on Mars.
   ``An expedition to Phobos would establish early leadership by
sending the first human travelers to the Martian moon to explore,
conduct resource surveys and establish a science station,'' said the
exploration office in an annual report.

   The far side of the moon, last
photographed by Apollo astronauts two decades ago, was captured on
film again by the Galileo spacecraft when it zoomed past the Earth
on its long voyage to Jupiter.
   ``It's staggering to realize we've been neglecting our own
satellite,'' said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Astronauts with the 1969-1972 Apollo lunar missions photographed
the back side of the moon, but Johnson said Thursday the last good
pictures before Galileo were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during
the 1960s.
   Galileo passed the moon after it swooped 597 miles above the
southwest Atlantic Ocean on Saturday. It used Earth's gravity as a
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun so
it can reach Jupiter in 1995. It used Venus for the same purpose
last February and will fly past Earth again in December 1992.
   The planetary encounters are meant solely to help propel Galileo
on its $1.4 billion mission to Jupiter. But scientists took the
opportunity to use the spacecraft to study Venus and Earth in dress
rehearsals for exploring Jupiter.
   Three of Galileo's new photographs of the moon and Earth were
released Thursday by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration as Galileo zoomed away from Earth, snapping more
pictures of its home planet from a distance of 2.33 million miles.
   One photo shows the crescent moon, while another shows Mare
Orientale, a 550-mile-wide meteorite impact crater on the far side
of the moon, which is always pointed away from Earth. Because of
the way the moon orbits Earth, only five-eighths of its surface can
be seen from Earth.
   Galileo's third picture shows half of Antarctica, including the
Ross Ice Shelf and mountains poking through ice near McMurdo Sound.
   ``This is the first time we've had a chance to use a spacecraft
designed to explore another planet to come back and look at our own
Earth and moon as if we were alien observers,'' Johnson said.
   ``In the process, we're learning some new scientific things
about our own world and its companion, but perhaps more
importantly, it's providing us a different perspective on our own
home planet as a fragile world,'' he said.
   Galileo is the first craft equipped with modern instruments to
study the far side of the moon and photographed some regions for
the first time, said Clark Chapman, a researcher from the Planetary
Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz.
   ``We're going to learn a lot about the geology of the back side
of the moon,'' Chapman said. ``It's been a fantastic lunar mission
already.''
   NASA plans to release more pictures Wednesday and hopes to
display a movie made of 1,400 still images showing clouds moving
above the spinning Earth.
   Some unreleased pictures were displayed Thursday during a NASA
closed-circuit television broadcast. They showed closeup views of
clouds drifting above Australia and more distant peeks at Asia,
India, Baja California and the Andes.
   Galileo was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18,
1989.
   It was to have been sent on a direct, two-year flight to
Jupiter. But after the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle
Challenger, NASA decided it was too risky to launch Galileo from
the shuttle using a powerful liquid-fueled rocket. A weaker booster
was used, requiring Galileo to use the gravity of Venus and Earth
to make a looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage.

<HEAD>Bush Weighs Proposed Moon Station, Mars Flight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with Fitzwater, source comments.

   President Bush today was weighing costs and
timing as he neared a decision on a Space Council recommendation to
set up a manned outpost on the moon and send astronauts to Mars,
officials said.
   ``There's a lot of analysis that needs to be considered,
especially in terms of cost'' to maintain a human outpost on the
moon and a Mars mission, White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters. ``It is a costly venture and those aspects
need to be considered.''
   One administration official close to the issue said Bush appeared
likely to endorse the language before him in a draft speech that
calls for building a permanent moon post as a way station to Mars.
But what timetable he might set was unclear.
   ``It's not a question of whether we will go to Mars. Someday we
will go to Mars. It's a question of how quickly,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source added that
the president was mulling how specific he should be about dates for
the venture.
   Bush's speech Thursday will mark the 20th anniversary of man's
first steps on the moon, taken by Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong
on July 20, 1969.
   Sources said the draft speech on Bush's desk contained no
pricetag or timetable for such a project.
   Dr. Frank Martin, the head of NASA's exploration office, said
such a project would more than double the current NASA budget of
some $13 billion a year, bringing it to about 2 percent or 3 percent
of the total federal budget.
   While a strong supporter of an agressive space program, Bush did
not want to set expensive goals that could not reasonably be funded,
officials said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, a principal booster of the proposal
that came to Bush through the National Space Council that Quayle
chairs, expected to talk to the president about it by telephone
today between speaking engagements in California, said his press
secretary, David Beckwith.
   Aides noted that Bush could make significant revisions in the
speech before delivering it. Fitzwater said ``there are all kinds of
choices and options available here ... timing questions and so
forth.''
   Bush on Tuesday was noncommittal about what he will say in the
speech, which has been billed as a major space policy address.
   ``I'm not ready to say whether we're going to have a new space
initiative. I want to be sure that what I propose passes any test of
fiscal sanity, fiscal reasonableness,'' he told reporters traveling
home with him from his European trip.
   Another idea _ the possibility of a joint space venture with the
Soviets _ was not included in the recommendations sent to him,
according to two officials. The administration looked at the speech
more in terms of setting U.S. goals in space, independent of what
the Soviet agenda might be, one said.
   But that did not mean space cooperation with the Soviets has been
ruled out, the two officials said,
   The president also is expected to push Congress for renewed
funding of the ongoing Space Station project whose budget is
threatened by congressional cuts. Funding reductions proposed by the
House Appropriations subcommittee recently would ``seriously
undermine'' that project, Quayle said Tuesday.
   Quayle on Tuesday hinted at a bold proposal. In a speech in San
Diego, he said the administration ``is moving forward to put the
pieces in place for another great leap forward in space.''
   He said the nation ``must begin to think about the voyage of a
new Mayflower _ about expanding the human presence into the solar
system _ as a long-term goal.''
   The only specifics Quayle mentioned were continued White House
backing for three projects already announced _ Space Station
Freedom, a new Earth observation satellite, and the national
aerospace plane.
   He said that by the year 2000 the nation ``must be on our way to
pioneering the Solar System and establishing outposts on the moon
and Mars.''
   Space boosters want Bush to issue a call reminiscent of President
John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge to the nation to land a man on the
moon by the end of the decade.
   White House officials preparing Bush's Thursday message on space
asked for extensive briefings on a NASA plan called ``Mission to
Planet Earth,'' a proposal for an intense environmental study of the
planet from space, sources said.
   ``There was talk that by supporting the Mission to Planet Earth
the president could help his image as the environmental president,''
a source at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.

FT  28 AUG 93 / New flights of fantasy: George Graham on Nasa's future after
the loss of Mars Observer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 980m Mars Observer was supposed to bring back the first new
pictures in nearly 20 years of the planet Mars. Instead, it is lost in space
without a radio. At best, the spacecraft may have swerved automatically into
an orbit around Mars, and there is an outside chance it may re-establish
contact with earth. At worst, it may have exploded.
'I'm betting it blew up on Saturday,' said Mr John Pike, a space specialist
at the Federation of American Scientists. 'If it was a big explosion, it's
in little bitty pieces.'
Nasa scientists suspect a faulty transistor and acknowledge they probably
face a 'non-recoverable situation'.
Back on earth, the Mars Observer's problems translate easily into an
uncomfortable metaphor about the once-proud National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
Nasa has suffered a series of mishaps on its programmes. Flawed mirrors have
hobbled the Hubble space telescope. Jammed antenna are hampering the Galileo
probe to Jupiter. And there have been delays and cancellations for space
shuttle launches - although these last-minute cancellations are preferable
to the kind of disaster that destroyed the Challenger shuttle in 1986.
Nasa officials say that even the glorious era of the Apollo moon missions
was not free of problems.
'We had glitches and failures back then in the heydays. We had engine
shutdowns on the pad - the very same kind of things that are happening
(today),' says Mr Wes Huntress, Nasa's associate administrator for space
science.
'We have established some very tough goals for ourselves in the space
programme. If they were easy to meet, anybody could meet them,' adds Mr
William Piotrowski, acting director of its solar system exploration
division.
But the space agency's reputation for being able to manage a budget
disappeared in smoke years ago. The General Accounting Office, the audit arm
of the US Congress, reported this year that Nasa underestimated costs on 25
out of 29 big projects. The recent technical setbacks have dealt further
blows to what remains of its image.
Mr John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington
University in Washington, says Nasa's recent setbacks are not merely
problems of the kind that can afflict even the best-run organisation; they
reflect the reality that Nasa lost its technical and managerial excellence
in the 1970s and 1980s.
Not even Nasa's critics - and they are many and varied - are rubbing their
hands at the Mars Observer's apparent failure. From the protesters who claim
Nasa is hiding evidence of intelligent life on Mars to the space analysts
who say the agency spends too much money on the costly shuttle to the
detriment of unmanned missions that could bring more knowledge, all had high
hopes from Mars Observer.
The disappointment is acute for those who had hoped that breathtaking
photographs of the surface of the red planet, the first since Viking in
1976, could help to rekindle the public imagination in a way that the
shuttle astronauts, who have turned into little more than space hauliers,
have not.
After its days of glory, Nasa became overweight. Whereas in 1972, when the
Apollo era ended with the last manned moon landing, Nasa and its contractors
employed 138,800 people, today they employ 100,000 more.
Mr Timothy Ferris, a science writer at the University of California at
Berkeley and adviser to several Nasa space exploration missions, says many
employees have fallen into a attitude where their main concern is justifying
their jobs. In the old days, however, 'people at Nasa worried about getting
to the moon'.
Where once President John F Kennedy sparked Nasa to excellence by
challenging it to put a man on the moon, such political leadership as Nasa
received in the 1970s and 1980s degenerated into prodding from members of
Congress anxious to ensure that the agency diverted work to their
constituencies.
The agency became a master of the art of extracting money from congressional
appropriations committees, by distributing largesse to as many supporters as
possible. When lobbying last year to save the space station Freedom from the
budget axe, Nasa circulated maps showing that the station generated jobs in
37 of 50 states and 151 of 435 congressional districts.
'Nasa sees its primary mission as the securing of appropriations from
Congress. Congress in turn understands the importance of big aerospace
programmes in maintaining jobs in the aerospace industry,' says Mr Ferris.
But Mr Daniel Goldin, who became Nasa's administrator 18 months ago, has won
some acclaim outside the agency for beginning to change all this.
When appointed, Mr Goldin was viewed with some suspicion by Nasa and
Congress, who resented the ousting of his predecessor, the former astronaut
Admiral Richard Truly. Some saw Mr Goldin as a cat's paw for Vice-president
Dan Quayle, who took the lead on space issues for the Bush administration.
Mr Al Gore, who was chairman of the Senate Science, Technology and Space
Subcommittee before he replaced Mr Quayle as Vice-president, was one of the
most vocal in questioning Mr Goldin's independence.
After some hesitation, President Bill Clinton kept Mr Goldin, with 25 years
of private sector experience at the TRW engineering group's space division,
to spearhead the assault on Nasa's bureaucracy.
Mr Goldin won more favour with the president for the alacrity with which he
took up Mr Clinton's challenge to redesign the space station, a permanently
manned orbiter Nasa plans to launch by 2001, so that it would cost less and
do more.
The new scaled-down station will include elements from the original Freedom
design, but should cost Dollars 8bn to Dollars 9bn less to build than
Freedom by its projected launch date and perhaps Dollars 18bn less to
operate over a 10-year life span.
Mr Goldin has also drafted a budget that cuts Nasa's five-year spending plan
by Dollars 15bn to Dollars 80.4bn. Although he has fought hard to keep the
space station alive, he is Nasa's fiercest critic, lambasting its 'appalling
management structures'.
'I personally am tired of Apollo stories. It's time we started writing
history and not reading it,' he told a meeting of space scientists recently.
Mr Goldin himself may not write much history. His task is more to shape Nasa
into the kind of entrepreneurial organisation that will once again do so.
Outsiders in the scientific community believe Mr Goldin has already done
much to shake out Nasa's bureaucratic stuffiness, though much remains to be
done.
Writing history, however, will require more than managerial excellence. Nasa
needs a new sense of mission to replace the urge to compete with the Soviet
Union that spurred earlier space probes.
Mr Clinton and Mr Gore offer Nasa an opportunity, by seeking to swing the
pendulum back to civilian pursuits and away from the Star Wars and military
projects that dominated space programmes under Presidents Reagan and Bush.
But they also want Nasa to spend more time and money on aeronautics research
with practical dividends for civil aviation. Manned missions to explore the
planets, they have warned, are a long way in the future.
Practical dividends have recently come to dominate other considerations, to
the extent that supporters of the space station conduct their annual battle
to preserve its budget by inventing ever more farcical claims that
everything from Aids to arthritis could be cured if only scientists could
experiment in zero gravity.
But a vital part of Nasa has always been the dream of pushing back the
boundaries of space. That dream has also been important to public support
for the agency and its budget.
Nasa may not be lost in space without a radio. Without that dream, however,
it might turn into little more than an earthbound technology agency.

   It should be spectacular. 

   Next Thursday, if plans work out, the space shuttle Discovery will roar from its launch pad as a million spectators cheer its rise into orbit. 
The future of the U.S. space program rides on the flight. 

   It is the first attempt to put Americans into space in the nearly three years since a shuttle explosion here killed seven astronauts, including a young teacher. 
Discovery "will restore NASA as an agency that sails on the ocean of space," says Thomas Paine, once head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 

   But another tragedy would doom U.S. manned space exploration. 
Even a triumphal mission won't resolve fundamental problems dogging the shuttle program. 

   NASA dreams of exploring the solar system by sending shuttle astronauts to launch giant telescopes, construct a manned space station and fetch satellites. 
But military and scientific critics complain that the shuttle is too expensive, too fragile and too unreliable for such missions. 
They want to turn to unmanned spacecraft instead. 
Even some of NASA's biggest supporters want to reduce shuttle launches to lessen the risk of another crash. 

   "The nub of the debate is: What do you do with humans in space?" says Richard DalBello, a space analyst for the Office of Technology Assessment, a research arm of Congress. 
"You don't need the shuttle if manned space isn't important." 

   The shuttle's great sophistication -- Russian cosmonauts thud to Earth in charred capsules, while shuttle astronauts glide down in airliner style -- also works against it. 
The shuttle performs more like a costly Indy 500 race car than the cheap, reliable cargo truck NASA once promised. 

   At a time of huge budget deficits, shuttle costs keep rising. 
In the early 1970s, NASA talked about launching a shuttle a week for about $10 million a launch. 
Now it wants to send up one a month for maybe $300 million a launch. 
Shuttle travel is so pricey that even an alchemist who could magically turn a cargo of lead into gold in space might lose money, says William Michael, a space expert at the National Academy of Sciences. 

   "The shuttle was clearly a mistake," grumbles Sen. William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the subcommittee that handles NASA's budget. 

   The spacecraft's complexity raises safety questions. 
A tiny flaw can send complex shuttle machinery hurtling toward disaster. 
Joseph Lombardo, director of the orbiter's main engines, worries that a small heating-coil leak could shut down the engine or blow it up. 
In the past year, he says, NASA found two heating-coil leaks during tests, although neither proved disastrous. 
NASA Administrator James Fletcher frets about the redesigned booster. 
"It's a more complicated beast than we thought it was," he says. 

   There is reason for concern. 
Already, Discovery's boosters are outfitted with only half the test instruments originally planned because NASA rushed to meet an early launch date, says Myron Uman, director of the National Research Council panel overseeing the booster redesign. 
NASA will drop most of those sensors after flight three, instead of flight six, he adds, because of budget problems. 
If NASA successfully launches a few shuttles, pressure will increase to quicken the pace -- and to slide a bit on safety. 

   NASA must become enormously more efficient, or cut safety margins, or give up on meeting its schedule. 
In 1985, the year before the Challenger disaster, NASA managed nine shuttle flights by working shuttle crews at the Kennedy Space Center to exhaustion and by recklessly cannibalizing spare parts from sitting shuttles. 
Now it takes three times as long as it once did to assemble shuttle boosters and refurbish the orbiter. 
But NASA still hopes to launch seven flights next year, 10 the year after that and, eventually, 14. 

   NASA managers swear they have learned the lessons of the Challenger disaster and won't scrimp on safety. 
Hot gases escaping from a faulty solid-rocket booster seal destroyed the shuttle in January 1986. 
Since then, the agency has redesigned about 500 parts in the orbiter, booster and external fuel tank that constitute the shuttle, and tested the changes thoroughly. 
NASA even riddled one booster with holes during a test firing to make sure it didn't blow up when damaged. 

   A successful launch will revive flagging interest in manned space exploration, the space agency hopes. 
"The public looks at the shuttle as the main event," asserts NASA's Mr. Fletcher. 
"They're interested in seeing people in space, not robots." 

   Initially, NASA will be content if it can launch its shuttle backlog of Pentagon spy satellites, unmanned planetary spacecraft and occasional commercial satellites without a glitch. 
But the agency also wants to spend $1.2 billion for a new generation of rocket boosters and about the same to build an unmanned shuttle that can lift three times the load of the current model. 

   With these improvements, NASA figures it can more easily construct a permanently manned space station and, from there, head out to the moon and Mars. 

   "NASA will lead the world into a high-tech era of space exploration," predicts Mr. Paine, the former NASA chief who has mapped out a plan for colonizing Mars. 

   But some of NASA's most important customers say they don't need a manned space shuttle to work in space, raising the question of exactly what NASA should use the shuttle for. 
After the Challenger disaster, President Reagan banned the shuttle from carrying communications satellites, hoping to spur the growth of privately owned rocket companies. 

   Now the Air Force, spooked by NASA's earlier attempts to grab all military payloads for the shuttle, wants to eliminate as many shuttle flights as it can. 
It is spending lavishly to build a new fleet of unmanned rockets and has indefinitely "mothballed" a shuttle launch site it spent $3.5 billion to build at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. 

   Space scientists want to be next to dump the shuttle in favor of unmanned launchers. 
Mr. Fletcher, NASA's chief, concedes that the shuttle has been a disaster for planetary probes because it isn't dependable enough to launch during the brief time periods -- sometimes only a week -- when the planets are properly aligned. 
An unmanned mission to Jupiter, named Galileo, is 10 years late and $1 billion over cost because of missed launch dates and other shuttle problems. 

   NASA once planned to equip planetary probes with powerful rockets for interplanetary travel, but after the Challenger disaster NASA discarded the rockets as too dangerous to fly on the shuttle. 
Galileo's replacement rockets are so underpowered that the Jupiter spacecraft must travel first to Venus and then back to Earth before it can pick up speed to head to Jupiter -- adding four years to the journey. 

   John Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., argues that the shuttle also will cripple NASA's plans to launch four big telescopes, called "The Great Observatories," to plot the birth and evolution of the universe. 
The first observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, is already six years late because of shuttle delays. 
The other three face similar delays unless they fly on unmanned rockets, he says. 
"The shuttle has set back space science in the U.S. by at least a decade," he complains. 

   Mr. Fletcher disagrees. 
He says the shuttle will be able to rescue the space telescopes should they run into trouble. 
NASA also plans to send shuttle astronauts to replace aging telescope parts with advanced instruments. 

   "You can use the shuttle to maintain {the telescopes} for decades, and even improve the electronics," adds Lennard Fisk, head of NASA's space science division. 

   The future of the shuttle is tied tightly to whether NASA finds the money to start projects to colonize the moon or Mars, or whether it is forced to settle largely for unmanned ventures. 
That is a choice NASA has tried to avoid since the moon landings because it fears its budget and its public support will shrivel without astronaut heroics. 
"NASA has no incentive for soul-searching," says Walter McDougall, a Pulitzer Prize-winning space historian. 

   Just how the presidential election will affect the shuttle program isn't clear. 
Neither of the candidates says what he will do with the shuttle. 
The program's $3.5 billion-a-year budget will make any efforts to reduce the deficit more difficult, especially when combined with NASA's plans to build a space station. 

   NASA plans to ask for $7.6 billion for the space station over the next three years as part of a project costing up to $30 billion. 
NASA plans as many as 20 shuttle launches in the mid-1990s to haul up space station parts and bolt them together. 
So if the president or Congress should decide to scale back the station to reduce the huge deficit, the need for the shuttle would drop. 

   Even some NASA supporters urge the space agency to reduce shuttle flights because a fatal accident anytime soon could doom manned exploration. 
Byron Leonard, an aerospace risk-assessment consultant in El Segundo, Calif., says that NASA should cut its planned flights from 14 a year to seven to stretch out the probable time between crashes. 
Mr. Leonard estimates that the shuttle has about a 2% to 3% chance of a major failure in flight, but says it is impossible to predict the disasters. 

   Other NASA boosters say the agency should enhance the shuttle's scientific value rather than promoting it as a cargo vehicle. 
During the Discovery mission, for instance, the shuttle's five astronauts will concentrate on releasing a NASA communications satellite -- something unmanned rockets have mastered for 25 years. 

   But the Discovery astronauts will also try to grow protein samples used in AIDS and cancer research that are difficult to make on earth, but which may blossom under near-weightless conditions. 
"There's a whole host of biological problems that we're approaching with this flight," says Larry DeLucas, a University of Alabama molecular biologist. 

   Future shuttle missions could boost scientific research even more. 
Spacehab Inc., of Washington, D.C., plans to outfit shuttle missions with a lab deck that would increase the number of experiments astronauts could run on the shuttle to 23 from about three. 
External Tanks Corp. in Boulder, Colo., proposes packing the shuttle's external fuel tank with instruments so it can take atmospheric measurements when it is jettisoned to earth. 

   Louis Frank, a University of Iowa physicist, sketches even bolder experiments. 
The shuttle could launch a small scientific satellite and circle around it while zapping it with radio waves, ion beams and electrons to measure the upper atmosphere and predict how satellite communications may be affected by turbulence. 

   Shuttles could also be modified so astronauts could spend 30 days in orbit, rather than 10, making them guinea pigs for scientists studying the effects of weightlessness. 
The shuttles then could spend weeks visiting smaller, cheaper space stations that could be built for, say, producing materials. 
"It would be like a lighthouse tender visiting an automated lighthouse" for servicing, says Mr. Paine, the former NASA administrator. 

   While these missions wouldn't be as dramatic as manned journeys through the solar system, they could make sensible use of the shuttle while the U.S. decides whether it wants to commit to more grandiose goals. 
Even some of NASA's sternest critics admit they would like to get to Mars. 
"It would be fabulous," says Mr. Bahcall, the astrophysicist. 
"It would be like building the pyramids -- something to remember."

   Voyager 2's Neptune encounter marks the
last planetary flyby by a U.S. spacecraft, but missions to Venus,
Jupiter and Mars mean America will keep exploring space, a NASA
official said Saturday.
   ``We are embarking on the second golden age of space science,''
said Lennard Fisk, the agency's associate administrator for space
science and applications. ``What's coming up is an era of
unprecedented excitement and activity.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to launch
35 space science flights in the next five years _ the highest launch
rate ever _ and U.S. spacecraft will be exploring planets
continuously from next year until 2006, Fisk said during a visit to
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Fisk was at the lab to watch Voyager 2's brush with Neptune last
Thursday night _ the probe's final encounter after it explored
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   ``In many ways, this is the end of an era, the last time we will
see a planet for a first time, the end of the reconnaissance phase
of planetary explorations,'' he said. There are no plans to explore
Pluto, the only planet still not visited by a spacecraft
   But Fisk listed several missions that will orbit planets rather
than fly past them:
   _Magellan, launched from a space shuttle last May, arrives at
Venus next August and will study that planet for several years.
   _Galileo will be launched from the shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 12,
arriving in orbit around Jupiter in 1996 and studying the planet
until the end of the century.
   _The Hubble Space Telescope is due for launch from a shuttle next
March, and is so powerful that from its orbit around Earth it will
be able to ``observe the universe back to the beginning of time,''
Fisk said.
   _Mars Observer will be launched in 1992, reaching the red planet
in 1993 and studying it until 1996.
   _NASA has asked Congress to approve the Comet Rendevous-Asteroid
Flyby and Cassini missions, Fisk said. CRAF would fly past an
asteroid, then orbit a comet from 2000 through 2002, Fisk said. The
similar spacecraft on the Cassini mission would drop a probe onto
Saturn's moon Titan, then orbit Saturn from 2002 through 2006.
   Fisk disputed assertions that unmanned space exploration will
suffer financially because of the shuttle program, saying that 70
percent to 80 percent of non-military shuttle flights will be
dedicated to space science.
   Fisk said space science studies suffered in recent years not from
a lack of funds, but because of delays in developing the shuttle and
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and halted
launches until last fall.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. should develop nuclear-powered
spaceships if it wants to send astronauts to Mars, a White
House panel on space exploration recommended.
   The group, headed by former Apollo astronaut Thomas
Stafford, recommended a series of technologies and proposed
missions to explore the moon with astronauts in about 2005,
and Mars about 10 years later. Vice President Dan Quayle, who
heads the National Space Council, had directed the panel to
search broadly for technology that could cut costs and
advance the pace of space exploration.

<TEXT>
   But the 27-member group, packed with veterans of the
Apollo manned flights to the moon, largely recommended
dusting off Apollo technology that the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration had shelved in the early 1970s when
lunar exploration was canceled. Along with nuclear
spaceships, the Stafford report recommended resurrecting
engine technology from the Saturn moon rockets and
Apollo-style capsules for astronauts to splash down in after
traveling to Mars.
   "Why are we using that old technology? Well it's good,
solid technology," said Max Faget, a panel member who
designed the Apollo capsules. NASA Administrator Richard
Truly said the report showed that "there's only a limited
number of ways to get to space."
   Using older technology could reduce costs somewhat from
the $500 billion exploration program NASA proposed in 1989,
said John Pike, a space analyst at the Federation of American
Scientists. The White House study recommended fewer vehicles
than the NASA proposal and also said it didn't need to use an
Earth-orbiting space station as a transportation center for
spacecraft traveling to and from Mars.
   Nevertheless, he estimated that the project would still
cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The White House study
didn't contain any cost estimates, but Mr. Stafford said the
group didn't expect any "blank check" to fund the proposals.
   The White House study said nuclear-powered craft could
reduce the round-trip travel time to Mars to about 320 days
from 400 days, reducing the debilitating effects on
astronauts of weightlessness and space radiation. In
addition, the powerful nuclear craft could lug more cargo
than similarly sized chemical rockets.
   Nuclear-thermal rockets heat low-weight propellant,
usually hydrogen, to high temperatures, and they produce
thrust in much the same way as conventional rockets. The
spacecraft envisioned by the study would use large,
conventional rockets to lift off from Earth and a nuclear
upper-stage for propulsion from Earth-orbit to Mars. Upon
returning from Mars, the crew would jettison the nuclear
stage into a solar orbit before the crew capsule landed on
Earth. For moon trips, nuclear rockets wouldn't be needed.
   The study "will set a path for the permanent manned
exploration of space," said Vice President Quayle. But so far
Congress has cut nearly all funds for manned expeditions, and
the panel's strong endorsement of nuclear power is certain to
raise objections from environmentalists. When NASA canceled
its last big nuclear rocket project in 1972, it had
field-tested a reactor on the ground, but had never flown one
in space.

<HEAD>NASA Plans Probe to Comet and Moon of Saturn</HEAD>

   NASA plans to land robot probes on a comet and
on a moon of Saturn early next century in new programs that would
cost $1.6 billion over the next seven years.
   In testimony prepared for a budget hearing before the House
committee on science, space and technology, National Aeronautics and
Space Administration scientist Lennard A. Fisk said Wednesday that
the unmanned spacecraft would allow the United States to maintain
world leadership in exploration of the solar system.
   Fisk, the associate NASA administrator for space science and
applications, said a mission called Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby,
or CRAF, would be launched in 1995 and would streak through space
for five years before meeting in space with the comet Kopff and
dropping a probe to its surface.
   He said the probe from the spacecraft would penetrate to the core
of the comet and study the chemistry of material that may date from
the beginning of the solar system.
   A second mission, called Cassini, would be launched in 1996 and
arrive in an orbit of the planet Saturn in the year 2002.
   Once there, Fisk said, the craft would drop a robot lander to the
surface of Titan, one of Saturn's moons, and conduct a chemical
analysis.
   This study, said the scientist, could provide a fundamental
understanding about the origins of life.
   ``The chemistry that gave rise to life in the past is no longer
available for us to study (on Earth),'' he said. ``However, we
believe that a chemistry similar to that on the early Earth ...
exists today on Titan.''
   The two missions, said Fisk, will both study primordial, pristine
matter, ``the material from which the solar system formed, the
material from which life on Earth formed, and the chemistry which
gave rise to that life.''
   Fisk said that the missions will require an appropriation of $30
million in fiscal year 1990, with increases every year that follows
for a total of about $1.6 billion by the time the spacecraft are
launched.
   He said the opportunity to fly the missions may be lost if the
money is not approved this year because the planetary alignment will
change and make the missions impossible.

Attention Vice President and National Space Council Chairman Dan Quayle: If 
you're looking for something important and innovative that the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration could actually do -- during your lifetime, 
perhaps even in this Administration -- here it is. How about a space 
environmental-study initiative? 
</P>
<P>
Recent news that U.S. Tiros-N weather satellites did not detect any 
global-warming trend from 1979 to 1988 raises a question: Why isn't science in 
space being used to answer questions that are driving everybody crazy on the 
ground? 
</P>
<P>
Environmental unknowns are a central topic of U.S political debate -- up to the 
White House, where top Bush Administration figures have been sparring over how 
serious the prospects for global warming are. Many in Congress are calling for 
major policy commitments as preemptive measures against environmental 
emergencies that may or may not be happening. International organizations are 
already issuing greenhouse-effect manifestoes. So where is NASA? 
</P>
<P>
NASA's current budget request bulges with capital for a continuously manned 
space station, an expensive -- $30 billion-$60 billion -- project whose returns 
to the public even its supporters have difficulty explaining. Millions more are 
allocated to the study of fantastically exorbitant -- perhaps $400 billion -- 
bases on the moon and expeditions to Mars, which both the President and vice 
president have rhapsodized about, because they sound incredibly nifty in 
non-binding speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Grand human ambitions such as a Mars flight will surely be realized someday. 
But today, in the Year of our Lord 0005 GR (fifth annum post-Gramm-Rudman), 
wasting breath on such notions may charitably be described as wacky. Meanwhile, 
there's comparatively little in the NASA budget for pragmatic environmental 
space missions that not only might provide information benefits for the 
taxpayers who foot NASA's bill, but also should be relatively cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting its annual money request to Congress last month, NASA rolled the 
drums for what it called a new environmental focus. This "focus" turns out to 
be repackaging projects in the pipeline for years -- lately under the name 
Mission to Planet Earth. Funds involved represent less than one-third of the 
probable cost of the initial overnight stay in NASA's beloved orbiting motel, 
the space station. Several projects, such as a pair of improved 
Earth-observation satellites, are great ideas. But amazingly, though NASA is 
hyping its environmental focus as a "crash" effort, some of the spacecraft 
involved won't go up for 15 years. NASA went from exploding rocket prototypes 
to a moon landing in far less time. 
</P>
<P>
From an environmental standpoint, NASA science missions usually point in the 
wrong direction. Most are oriented toward the outer planets and the far heavens 
-- fascinating, but with no meaningful effect on the Earth. The sun, source of 
all Earth life, has received surprisingly little investigation; the same for 
Venus, the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and, more to the point, a 
planet with a runaway greenhouse atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most influential global warming document in the Bush White House 
has been a paper, written principally by the astronomer and "Star Wars" 
advocate Robert Jastrow, arguing that by the sun's sheer power, tiny 
vacillations in solar output are more likely to be the root cause of earthly 
climate variations than human mischief such as carbon-dioxide emissions. 
Jastrow contends that although the pattern of global temperature ups and downs 
in this century does not sync with greenhouse theory -- the thermostat has 
bounced around instead of rising smoothly -- it does appear to correspond with 
what's known about fluctuations in the sun's luminosity. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists understand amazingly little about the internal processes of the 
sun: Accurate information about its energy output is notoriously scarce, 
because such data is best collected in space. Sound like a promising field of 
inquiry? Yet NASA continues to devote more funds to studying other stars than 
our own. 
</P>
<P>
This October the shuttle Discovery is scheduled to launch Ulysses, an 
international robot spacecraft that will examine the sun's polar regions, 
unobservable from Earth. Ulysses is the first probe of the sun in more than a 
decade. Next year the shuttle Columbia is scheduled to carry aloft an automated 
solar study station called Atlas, which will be brought back down and taken up 
throughout the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
These are sound ideas, but fall short. NASA should be designing a major series 
of probes and satellites to ring the sun on a continuing basis -- not during 
brief shuttle trips as with Atlas. Such an initiative might not only help 
answer some of the pressing ecological questions: It could provide an early 
warning system for any changes in the fusion generator that sustains earthly 
existence. What if the sun cooled? We'd need to know that. 
</P>
<P>
Next consider Venus, whose size and composition are Earth-like, but whose 
900-degree surface temperatures are believed to result from a runaway 
greenhouse effect. NASA has a billion-dollar orbital research station in 
transit to Venus, for compiling radar maps of the topography of this 
carbon-clouded world. Such diagrams are likely to be interesting to astronomy 
graduate students and worthless from a practical standpoint. Yet the United 
States has no plans to fire probes into the Venusian atmosphere to find out 
what went wrong there -- knowledge that might bear directly on the terrestrial 
greenhouse debate. 
</P>
<P>
NASA, of course, isn't oblivious to the potential for reorienting temporarily 
toward environmental studies of immediate benefit to Earthlings. But in recent 
years budgetary circling of wagons has become the agency's claim to fame. Since 
Challenger, NASA management has exhibited absolute bureaucratic terror about 
offending any interest group, manufacturer or congressman's district by 
altering any plan once made. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, space environmental research would be carried out by boring, 
affordable automated spacecraft rather than marvelous budget-boosting manned 
chariots. A decade of inconclusive study of Mars flight is probably worth more 
to NASA's empire than a program to produce environmental information quickly. 
</P>
<P>
At minimum, the Mission to Earth projects should take precedence over 
feasibility studies about growing hydroponic oranges on Mars. Crash efforts 
focusing on the sun and Venus should be initiated. Everyone complains that NASA 
lacks a mission relevant to the man on the street. Here's one.

   An unmanned Soviet research probe is orbiting Mars
on a research mission to learn more about the planet's climate and
soil, the official news agency Tass reported.
   Phobos II went into orbit Sunday after a six-month,
111-million-mile voyage from Earth, Tass said.
   The spacecraft is carrying instruments and experiments prepared
by 12 countries and the European Space Agency. Soviet officials say
the mission will help them prepare for a manned mission to Mars in
the early 21st century.
   Phobos II was launched July 12 in an ambitious program to unlock
mysteries of the Red Planet and its largest moon, Phobos.
   The probe is supposed to record daily and seasonal temperature
changes on Mars, make a temperature map of the surface, and identify
areas where the soil is permanently frozen, Tass said. Data on the
planet's minerals and atmosphere also will be collected.
   The spacecraft is to approach within 50 yards of the moon Phobos
in early April to analyze its soil with a laser and drop two small
landing craft onto the surface.
   The Phobos program is the most ambitious of nearly 20 U.S. and
Soviet unmanned missions to study Mars, believed to be the planet
most like Earth after Venus.
   But problems have marred the $480 million mission.
   In September, a Soviet ground controller sent an erroneous
computer command to a sister ship called Phobos I. That spacecraft,
launched July 7, froze in space and ground controllers have been
unable to communicate with it.
   The probes carry similar equipment, but Phobos I also is equipped
to study neutron radiation and the magnetic field around Mars.
   Last month, Tass said some instruments aboard Phobos II had
failed but that most have been fixed. It said the problems would not
prevent completion of its research.
   Tass said Phobos II is the first spacecraft to orbit Mars.
However, U.S. officials say American probes orbited Mars during the
Viking missions of the 1970s.

<HEAD>Bush Says U.S. Must Go Back to Moon, on to Mars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years after man's first step on the
moon, President Bush said Thursday Americans must commit to the
permanent settlement of space, first returning to the moon and then
embarking on a ``journey into tomorrow,'' a manned mission to
distant Mars.
   The president offered no firm timetable or pricetag for a program
that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars but said it would be
worth the cost ``because it is humanity's destiny to strive, to
seek, to find. And because it is America's destiny to lead.''
   His proposal was made in a ceremony, on the steps of the National
Air and Space Museum, marking the historic moment July 20, 1969,
when American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped on
the moon's Sea of Tranquility to fulfill a pledge made eight years
earlier by President Kennedy.
   The two moonwalkers stood with Bush Friday, along with Mike
Collins, the third Apollo 11 crewman who said, ``We have rested on
our Apollo laurels long enough; it's time to get moving again.''
   Bush's proposal _ to establish a U.S. moon base early in the next
century and then mount a manned Mars mission _ likely will ignite a
long national debate both in a budget-minded Congress and among
those who believe federal dollars should not be spent on costly
space endeavors but on solving more earthly problems.
   At a time of huge budget deficits, Congress already is balking at
the start-up costs for NASA's $30 billion space station, which Bush
said was ``a first and necessary step for sustained manned
exploration.''
   Congress, he said, is ``where the future of the space station _
and our future as a space-faring nation _ will be decided.''
   Bush offered few details beyond his broad goals and said he was
leaving it to Vice President Dan Quayle, as head of the National
Space Council, and to NASA to come up with ``realistic timetables.''
Putting the space station in orbit has been scheduled for after 1995.
   The president chose to look beyond the budget debate over the
space station budget.
   ``We must commit ourselves anew to ... the permanent settlement
of space,'' he said. ``We must commit ourselves to a future where
Americans and citizens of all nations will live and work in space.''
   Richard Truly, the NASA administrator hailed Bush's initiative as
``dynamite'' and said that if the program is approved, NASA will be
ready to establish a moon base ``in the dawn of the new century.''
   Truly said cuts in the NASA budget in recent years have weakened
the agency so that in its present structure it could not carry out
such visionary plans.
   Truly said he had no estimate on how much Bush's program would
cost. But he noted that during the heyday of the Apollo program
NASA's funding represented more than 4 percent of the national
budget compared with about 1 percent now.
   He said the job could be done with less than 4 percent.
   Other observers have estimated that if Bush's proposal were
adopted, NASA's present budget request of $13.3 billion would have
to more than double within a few years and that the whole package
eventually could cost as much as $800 billion to $900 billion.
   Bush will need to forge an alliance with Democratic leaders to
win the funding for serious space exploration, and initial skeptical
reaction came from Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the House majority
leader.
   ``The real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can
marshal the words but the resources to restore America's preeminence
in space,'' Gephardt said. ``In sum, Mr. President, there's no such
thing as a free launch.''
   The proposal also drew opposition from a key member of the house
committee that oversees NASA appropriations.
   ``Given the federal budget deficit and earthly demands, I don't
see how we can afford expensive manned programs in space in the near
future,'' said Rep. Bill Green of New York.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said Bush was ``calling for one great
leap for mankind'' but not even providing the money for ``one small
step,'' using a take-off of Armstrong's first words from the lunar
surface.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., a member of the Senate committee
charged with the space agency budget, said: ``By proposing a return
to the moon and a manned base on Mars, with no money, no timetable
and no plan, Bush offers the country not a challenge to inspire us,
but a daydream to briefly entertain us.''
   Meanwhile, the full House handily defeated an attempt by Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to transfer $714 million from the proposed
fiscal 1990 budget for the space station to programs for veterans'
medical care, pollution control and low-income and elderly housing.
   Bush's ceremony with the astronauts blended his glimpse into the
future with reminiscences of the Apollo program.
   He unveiled a new postage stamp commemorating the first moon
landing, then signed a proclamation marking Space Exploration Day.
He invited the astronauts and their families back to the White House
for a picnic lunch.
   Bush recalled the first moon landing two decades ago, saying,
``Some called it quixotic, impossible ... but America did it.'' Now,
he said, it is time for the nation to head ``back to the moon, back
to the future, and this time back to stay.''
   Under NASA scenarios outlined last year, a permanently manned
base on the front side of the moon would require astronaut crews to
construct an Antarctic-type facility, mixing mineral-rich lunar soil
with water to form a kind of cement.
   Oxygen extracted from moon rocks could be mixed with hydrogen
brought from Earth to fuel expeditions to Mars and elsewhere.
   To explore Mars, one NASA option would use humans, the other a
robot to move around the surface. A third would place men on the
Mars moon Phobos to guide the rover on Mars.
