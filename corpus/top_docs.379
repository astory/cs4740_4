<P>
Astronomers have discovered what may be the largest galaxy in the known 
universe, a mammoth cluster of stars that stretches for 6 million light years 
-- more than 60 times the size of the Milky Way, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The giant object is located in the heart of a cluster of galaxies known as 
Abell 2029, a team of astronomers reported in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
The object is 1 billion light years from Earth -- that is, the distance light 
travels in 1 billion years at a speed of 186,000 miles per second. 
</P>
<P>
Using a 36-inch telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, 
astronomers Juan Uson of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Stephen 
Boughn of Haverford College and Jeffrey Kuhn of Michigan State University were 
able to detect a "halo" of diffuse light surrounding a massive galaxy at the 
center of Abell 2029. 
</P>
<P>
A mosaic of 16 images made with light-sensitive electronic "chips" showed the 
diffuse halo to be remarkably uniform, leading the astronomers to conclude they 
were looking at a single galaxy, the largest ever discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Measurements indicate that the galaxy has a diameter of 6 million light years, 
more than 4 1/2 times the diameter of the previous record holder and 60 times 
wider than Earth's Milky Way, which has a diameter of about 100,000 light 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists believe that they are seeing a giant galaxy primarily because 
the halo's light spreads very smoothly outward from the central galaxy and 
because the halo has the same elliptical shape as the central galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite simply, the central galaxy is indistinguishable from the diffuse light 
that extends . . . from the cluster center," they said. "Thus, this object is 
among the largest and most luminous galaxies observed." 
</P>
<P>
The galaxy shines with 2 trillion times the light produced by Earth's sun and 
is elliptical in shape. About 26% of the light given off by the galactic 
cluster is contributed by this one galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an organized mass of light and energy," Kuhn said in a news release. 
"It's a very large, organized galaxy."

<HEAD>Largest Galaxy is 60 Times Size of Milky Way, Astronomers Say</HEAD>

   Astronomers reported today they have found the
largest galaxy ever discovered in a concentration of stars that
stretches for 6 million light years, or more than 60 times the size
of the Milky Way.
   A central galaxy in a distant cluster of galaxies called Abell
2029 has more than 100 trillion stars, said a study published in
the journal Science. The Milky Way, which includes the sun and its
solar system, has about 3 billion stars.
   The stellar structure ``is the largest single galaxy that has
been resolved,'' said Jeffrey R. Kuhn, a Michigan State University
astronomer who coauthored the study.
   ``If we talk about the galaxy and the halo (diffused light
around the galaxy) as a single entity, then it is the largest
object that we are aware of,'' he said.
   Until this study, the largest known galaxy was Markarian 348,
which was identified in 1987. It is 1.3 million light years in
diameter.
   Kuhn and his co-investigators, Juan M. Uson of the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory and Stephen P. Boughn of Haverford
College, determined the size of the galaxy using a series of
observations from the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.
   Sixteen photos taken by the observatory's 36-inch telescope were
processed through a computer that removed from the view all of the
light from other sources. This enabled the scientists to precisely
measure the brightness and size of the galaxy, although individual
stars could not be resolved.
   Later, a second series of photos from Kitt Peak confirmed the
findings.
   Kuhn said the Abell 2029 cluster of galaxies is about a billion
light years away and includes about a thousand galaxies, each with
billions of stars.
   ``If you were to look up into the sky and could see this
cluster, they would occupy an area a little smaller than the
moon,'' he said. ``Of course, they are much fainter than the eye
can see.''
   A light year is 5.89 trillion miles, the distance that light can
travel in one year in a vacuum.
   The very large galaxy, classified by astronomers as a cD (for
central dominant), emits more than a quarter of all the light
radiated by the entire cluster.
   Kuhn said that by analyzing the diffuse light by computer, the
group was able to determine that there was little stellar matter
between the cD galaxy and others in the Abell 2029 cluster. This
suggests, he said, that the cD galaxy and the cluster itself formed
about the same time.
   ``One of the theories about cD galaxies has been that they form
by collisions of galaxies,'' Kuhn said. ``When galaxies collide,
stars in the smaller galaxies end up being stripped away and fall
into this giant galaxy in the middle.''
   But the cD galaxy in Abell 2029, he said, ``is much too large to
have been formed by stripping. It seems likely that it formed at
the same time that the cluster formed and it may have formed out of
remnant material that did not fall into the small galaxies.''
   Also, Kuhn said, if stripping was a factor in the formation of
the galaxy, there would still be clumps of debris giving off light
between the galaxies. But the observations detected only a smooth,
empty space.
   Richard Mushotzky, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Center in
Maryland, said the work may help solve one of the underlying
mysteries in astronomy.
   ``We don't understand how clusters are built,'' Mushotzky said.
``If this (Abell 2029 study) can be verified, it could
substantially advance our understanding of how galaxies and
clusters are formed.''

<HEAD>Most Comprehensive Survey Of Milky Way Galaxy To Start Thursday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most detailed survey of the Milky Way
will start Thursday at the world's most sensitive radio telescope,
an array of 27 dish-shaped antennas spread across New Mexico's
desert.
   ``Without a doubt this will give us the most comprehensive
picture of our galaxy yet obtained in any kind of wavelength,''
including visible light and radio and infrared radiation, said
Robert H. Becker, associate professor of astronomy at the
University of California, Davis.
   The $1 million, two-year survey will be conducted by Becker and
astronomer David Helfand of Columbia University. They will use the
Very Large Array radio telescope, a set of 27 antenna dishes, each
about 80 feet in diameter, that move on 20 miles of tracks west of
Socorro, N.M.
   The telescope, which started operations in the late 1970s, can
detect fainter radio signals than any other radio telescope, Becker
said Tuesday during a telephone interview.
   More complete surveys of the heavens beyond our galaxy have been
conducted using powerful optical and infrared telescopes aimed to
look above or below the Milky Way's flattened disk.
   But such telescopes can't survey our own galaxy very well
because visible light is blocked by tremendous amounts of dust
between the Milky Way's stars and because the galaxy is so full of
infrared light sources that it's hard to distinguish various
objects, Becker said.
   The survey will construct maps of the 70 percent of the Milky
Way visible from the Northern Hemisphere by detecting objects that
emit radio waves, which penetrate the dust.
   Such objects include supernovas, or dying, exploding stars; vast
dust-and-gas clouds where new stars are born; and very dense
supernova remnants called neutron stars, pulsars and black holes.
   ``What this kind of survey can do is give you the overall
picture,'' Becker said. ``Until you catalog the contents of your
own galaxy, you're never going to have a clear picture of what the
galaxy is.''
   The disk-shaped Milky Way contains an estimated 100 billion
stars clumped in spiraling arms that stretch across 100,000 light
years, or about 588,000 trillion miles, of space. Earth is located
roughly 22,000 light years, or 130,000 trillion miles, from the
galaxy's center.
   Becker said the survey undoubtedly will produce unexpected
discoveries, but also could help astronomers determine the
frequency and location of supernova explosions invisible to optical
telescopes.
   Shock waves from such explosions are thought to compress gas and
dust to create new stars.
   The survey will help determine if that theory is correct by
showing if there is a link between the location of supernovas and
regions of star formation, Becker said.
   While some stars leave nothing behind after they explode as
supernovas, other supernovas collapse into dense neutron stars,
rotating neutron stars called pulsars or even more dense objects
called black holes, which have gravity so intense that not even
light escapes.
   Becker said the survey should help astronomers learn what
proportion of supernovas become neutron stars, pulsars or black
holes because such objects generate radio signals.
   While the survey won't detect life that might exist elsewhere in
the galaxy, it could help scientists improve estimates of the odds
that such life exists, Becker said.
   ``If one wants to estimate the probability of finding
intelligent life elsewhere in our galaxy, you have to know what the
environment of our galaxy is,'' including the number of objects
that may be orbited by inhabited planets, he said.
   Recent improvements to the Very Large Array gave it a much
larger field of view, so ``it will take fewer pointings of the
telescope to map out the Milky Way,'' Becker said.
   Becker and Helfand will have 300 hours of viewing time during
the survey. They then will spend another year or two using
computers to contruct maps using the detected radio signals.
   The first 20 to 24 hours of survey-related observations will
start Thursday and end Saturday, with more intermittent
observations regularly scheduled during the next two years each
time the antennas are re-aimed, Becker said.
   The survey is financed by the University of California, the
National Science Foundation and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.

   The Milky Way Galaxy, home of the sun and the
Earth, has a core shaped like a football instead of the perfectly
spherical center many astronomers have long believed, according to
a new study.
   Astronomers at the University of Maryland and Princeton
University announced Thursday the discovery of evidence that the
spiral arms of the Milky Way actually rotate around an oval center,
causing the sun to follow an elliptical path in its 200
million-year orbit of the galaxy center.
   Leo Blitz of the University of Maryland said that the discovery
shows that the Milky Way is a so-called barred spiral galaxy. This
means that the spiral arms, composed of stars, gas and other
matter, flare out from a so-called bar structure of stars and gas
at the center. In a normal spiral galaxy, the arms curve out like
spokes from the very center.
   ``It has been something of a holy grail for astronomers to
determine if the Milky Way is a barred spiral or a normal spiral
galaxy,'' said Blitz. ``This study shows it is barred.''
   The Milky Way galaxy is disk-shaped with a large bulge in the
middle. Seen from above, arms flare out like curved spokes,
creating a spiral appearance. The galaxy has a diameter of about
100,000 light years and a thickness, seen from the edge, of about
4,000 light years.
   A light year is the distance light will travel in a year, about
6 trillion miles.
   In other galactic news, two other astronomers said Thursday they
have confirmed that the Milky Way and about 100 other galaxies are
being pulled toward a powerful gravitational source called ``the
great attractor'' over a region of space 100 million light years
wide.
   The new findings, expanding on preliminary 1987 observations,
show galaxies on both sides of the ``attractor'' are swerving
toward it in addition to their normal motion away from each other,
said Alan Dressler of the Carnegia Instititon of Washington and
Sandra Faber of the University of California at Santa Cruz.
   The sun and its solar system, which includes the Earth, are
located in one spoke, about midway out from the galaxy center. That
spoke, along with the four other arms of the Milky Way, rotate
about the galaxy core. Though the rotation rate of the arm at the
sun's location is about 600,000 miles an hour, the galaxy is so
large that it takes about 200 million years to complete one
rotation, or orbit.
   Because the sun is away from the middle of the galaxy _ about
25,000 light years from the center _ the galaxy is seen edge-on
from the Earth. This means that stars, clouds and dust obscures the
view of most of the Milky Way. And this has blocked astronomers
from being able to determine the shape of the galaxy center
directly.
   Blitz and David Spergel of Princeton overcame this problem by
examining the movement of hydrogen gas clouds in the outer regions
of the Milky Way, an area called the galactic halo that surrounds
the Milky Way like a globe.
   Spergel said the hydrogen movement was first studied about 15
years ago, but the motions were never well understood. He said the
new study, developed with the help of a computer, showed that
movement of the clouds, caused by gravitational influences, could
be explained only if there is an ellipsoidal center to the galaxy.
   ``The center is like a football,'' said Blitz. ``There is
absolutely no question about the data on this.''
   Since, according to the study, the sun and its solar system move
about the galaxy in an ellipse instead of a circle, the sun's
distance from the galactic center will change regularly over time.
Right now, Blitz and Spergel said the sun is about halfway between
its closest approach to the center and the farthest point of its
orbit.
   The sun will reach its outermost point from the galactic center
in 25 million years. That is about 1,500 light years farther away
than the point of closest approach to the center.
   ``It's not something we have to worry about,'' said Blitz.
   A paper on the study was given Thursday at the 175th national
meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

   A huge disk of hydrogen gas discovered 65
million light years away suggests that galaxies are still being
formed in the universe, a finding that could modify the current
theory that star systems formed within a relatively short time after
the ``big bang.''
   Riccardo Giovanelli, head of the Radio Astronomy Group at the
National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center in Arecibo, Puerto Rico,
and Martha Haynes, associate professor of astronomy at Cornell
University, found the gas cloud earlier this year using the
1,000-foot radiotelescope dish at Arecibo.
   Others astronomers said Tuesday that the findings were
``exciting'' and ``important'' and could reshape the current view of
the history of the universe.
   The cloud of hydrogen gas is 10 times larger in diameter than the
Milky Way Galaxy, which includes the sun, and appears to be in the
shape of a disk that is rotating slowly, the National Science
Foundation announced.
   Carl Heiles, a professor of astronomy at the University of
California, Berkeley, said the gas cloud ``is a very important
discovery.''
   ``It shows that there are clouds of gas out there that have not
yet turned into galaxies,'' he said. Further study, said Heiles,
could lead to modifications of the basic ``big bang'' concept of the
universe.
   The ``big bang'' theory postulates that the universe began with a
cataclysmic explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago and that
galaxies of stars formed within a few hundred million years after
that. Astronomers have earlier reported findings that suggested star
formation within existing galaxies, and studies that indicated that
some galaxies may have formed billions of years later than others.
   But there have been no earlier reported findings of true
``proto-galaxies,'' or star systems at the very beginning of
formation. The general belief has been that such formation halted
billions of years ago.
   Giovanelli and Haynes said they made the discovery through luck.
They were attempting to calibrate the radiotelescope by aiming it at
a part of the sky they thought was empty.
   ``Before stumbling into this thing, neither I nor Martha were
great believers in the existence of such objects,'' Giovanelli said
in a statement. ``But this cloud indicates that the disks of
galaxies can form slowly throughout the history of the universe and
not just be something that happened during some magic period of the
distant past.''
   Gas clouds have been discovered in the heavens, but those were
associated with existing galaxies.
   ``This cloud seems to have formed independently, in a pocket of
space isolated from other galaxies,'' said Giovanelli.
   No stars were found in the gas cloud.
   Most astronomers believe that galaxies form when hydrogen atoms
collect in
   huge clouds that are collapsed by gravity and that form clumps
that further gravitational collapse turn into stars.
   Giovanelli and Haynes estimated the mass of the cloud at about a
tenth of the Milky Way, which contains billions of stars.
   Heiles said the relatively small mass of the cloud presents no
problems to the theory that it is a proto-galaxy.
   ``There are lots of small galaxies out there, lots that are about
10 percent the size of our Milky Way,'' he said.
   James Rose, an associate professor of astromony at the University
of North Carolina who has studied young galaxies, called the new
finding ``very exciting.''
   ``This would be the first time that we could see a mass of gas
changing itself into a galaxy,'' he said. ``It offers the
opportunity to study the process in great detail.''
   Rose said that fact that the cloud is close to Earth by
astronomical standards, just 65 million light years away, will help
astronomers study it. A light year is a measure of distance used by
astronomers. It is the distance that light travels through a vacuum
in one year, about 5.7 trillion miles.
   Heiles said the next step now is to conduct a careful search for
other such clouds in the universe. He said astronomers may find that
there are many other such clouds, or forming galaxies.
   Presently, said Heiles, it is believed that vast areas of the
heavens are devoid of any matter. He said a survey might find that
many of those voids are not empty at all, but filled with hydrogen
clouds, or proto-galaxies.

   Cornell University astronomers said they believe they have discovered a galaxy in the making, possibly undermining theories of the universe's evolution. 

   "We found a galaxy without stars," said Martha Haynes, a Cornell astronomer who made the discovery on a giant radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. 
"This galaxy is just getting ready" to become a profusion of stars. 
Ms. Haynes found the unborn galaxy along with Riccardo Giovanelli, another Cornell astronomer. 

   Galaxies are clusters of billions of stars; the Earth and the sun are part of the cluster known as the Milky Way. 
By the prevailing theories of the origin of the universe, galaxies started to form shortly after the Big Bang, a cataclysmic explosion of gases about 16 billion years ago that launched the universe, and they continued forming for about 10 billion years. 
So every galaxy should have been born billions of years ago. 

   The Cornell observations contradict this time theory. 
Ms. Haynes said she found the unborn galaxy -- a massive cloud of hydrogen gas 10 times larger than the Milky Way -- 65 million light years away. 
In astronomy, distance translates into time, so the cloud observed by Ms. Haynes actually corresponds to the cloud as it was 65 million years ago. 
Because these clouds take hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of years to form stars, the cloud is now evolving into a galaxy. 

   "This is the first time a galaxy-sized thing has been caught in the act of forming," said James Gunn, a Princeton University astrophysicist familiar with the work, which was conducted in March but will be published in the Astrophysical Journal of Letters in November. 
"This is the Rosetta stone of galaxy formation." 

   Galaxies form from the collapse of dust and hot gases, mostly hydrogen, under the weight of their own gravitation. 
Ms. Haynes theorized that this particular galaxy, which she calls simply "The Cloud," is taking so long to form because it's only slightly more dense than necessary for matter to collapse. 
"It's forming right now, under our noses," said Mr. Gunn. 

   K.Y. Lo, a University of Illinois astronomer, who also has searched for unborn galaxies, cautioned that the discovery needs to be confirmed. 
He said astronomers must make sure that the hydrogen cloud isn't leftover material associated with another galaxy, or that the cloud isn't inhabited by faint stars. 
"The evidence is tantalizing," he said. 
"But it might not be a proto-galaxy with pristine {hydrogen} gas." 

   Ms. Haynes attributed the discovery largely to luck. 
She said that she and her colleague, Mr. Giovanelli, were studying the galaxy UGC-7394, when they turned the radio telescope to what they thought was empty space to calibrate the instrument. 
To their surprise, they found the empty space emitted radio signals indicating a huge hydrogen cloud. 

   The radio signals "looked like they would if there was a galaxy there," Ms. Haynes said, "but there was nothing there." 
The hydrogen cloud, which isn't detectable by optical telescopes, is just south of the Virgo cluster -- the cluster of galaxies nearest the cluster containing Earth. 

   Mr. Gunn said he expected that the Cornell finding would lead to the discovery of other unborn galaxies in different parts of the universe. 
After scientists have a number of hydrogen clouds to compare, he said, they should be able to learn more about what happened in the first sliver of a second after the Big Bang, when the primordial matter from which galaxies were formed exploded outward. 

   Jonathan Grindlay, chairman of Harvard University's astronomy department, said the Cornell work might indicate what will happen at the end of time. 
Astronomers currently debate whether the universe will continue expanding forever or slow down and collapse into a cataclysmic Big Crunch. 
The existence of unexpected hydrogen clouds would indicate there's more mass than previously believed in space. 
"That goes in the direction that the universe will collapse," he said.

   Astronomers have spotted the most distant known
star in the Milky Way, and say the accidental discovery could help
determine the total mass of the galaxy.
   That includes mysterious invisible matter that astronomers know
exists but are unable to identify, an astronomer with the Space
Telescope Science Institute said Tuesday.
   ``Astronomers suspect that there is a lot of additional material
surrounding our galaxy that doesn't give off light,'' said Howard
Bond, who along with two others discovered the distant star last
spring.
   ``We don't know the mass of the Milky Way, but if we can find
objects that are far out and measure their speed, it will help us
determine the galaxy's total mass _ the visible areas and the dark
areas.''
   Astronomers use the speed of stars to determine gravitational
pull upon them, and from its gravity, the mass of the galaxy.
   Astronomers theorize the galaxy's dark matter could be dim stars
that are too faint to be seen, black hole remnants of massive stars
that exploded early in the galaxy's history or some unknown type of
subatomic particle, Bond said.
   ``We used to think that the majority of the mass of the Milky
Way was stars, but now we suspect stars may only be 10 percent of
all the mass,'' he said. Once the mystery of the dark matter is
solved, he said, ``we may find something completely unexpected that
could revolutionize our thinking about physics.''
   Andrew Fraknoi, executive director of the Astronomical Society
of the Pacific in San Francisco, said the discovery is important
because it is another confirmation that the Milky Way is much
larger than once thought.
   ``When you look at in a larger context that's what makes this so
exciting _ if they've really found something so distant that it is
way beyond where we thought the borders of the galaxy lay,'' he
said.
   The scientists stumbled upon the star while studying a distant
galaxy. The star is located 160,000 light years from Earth in the
direction of the constellation Virgo.
   The Milky Way was once thought to be only about 100,000 lights
year across. Since the Earth is about 30,000 light years from the
center of the Milky Way, the discovery means the galaxy is larger
than even more recent estimates indicated.
   ``It was just dumb luck that this star was in the way of what
they were looking at. It was totally serendipitous,'' said Ray
Villard, a spokesman for the institute. ``It just shows that there
are a lot of wonderful surprises out there that we may stumble upon
when we're looking for something else.''
   The star is an isolated member of an immense but thinly
populated halo of old, faint stars surrounding the Milky Way. It
was spotted while astronomers Robin Ciardullo and George Jacoby of
the National Optical Astronomy Observatories in Tucson, Ariz., were
surveying the giant elliptical galaxy M49, which is 50 million
light-years from Earth.
   Ciardullo, Jacoby and Bond have observed the star using
telescopes in Hawaii and Arizona, and measurements of its
brightness have been made at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory in Chile.
   The star is a member of a well-known class of stars called the
RR Lyrae variables, Bond said. Because the brightness of those
stars already has been documented, astronomers can use the
brightness of the new star, known only as the ``Virgo variable,''
to measure its distance, he said.

   The National Science Foundation says
astronomers believe they have stumbled across evidence that galaxies
may still be forming in the universe.
   The evidence is a massive cloud of hydrogen, 10 times larger than
the Milky Way galaxy, all by itself and close by astronomical
standards _ 65 million light-years away, the foundation said Monday.
   The discovery would appear to challenge the current belief that
all galaxies were formed within the first few hundred million years
after the ``Big Bang'' explosion dispersed hydrogen and matter in
the universe.
   The hydrogen cloud was found by Riccardo Giovanelli, adjunct
professor of astronomy at Cornell University and head of the radio
astronomy group at the foundation's National Astronomy and
Ionosphere Center in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and co-worker, Martha
Haynes, associate professor of astronomy at Cornell.
   ``Before stumbling into this thing, neither I nor Martha were
great believers in the existence of such objects,'' Giovanelli said.
   ``But this cloud indicates that the discs of galaxies can form
slowly throughout the history of the universe and not just be
something that happened during some magic period in the distant
past.''
   Giovanelli and Haynes found the cloud while calibrating detectors
attached to the 1,000-foot dish radio telescope at Arecibo. For
calibration, they pointed the dish at a region of the sky thought to
be devoid of objects _ and found the characteristic radio signal of
hydrogen.
   Astronomers believe galaxies, massive groupings of millions to
billions of stars, must form from the condensation of hydrogen, the
simplest element _ a proton accompanied by an electron.
   Previous searches for cloud ``protogalaxies'' had failed to find
anything, though there is strong evidence for the existence of
clouds of hydrogen.
   Light from quasars, incredibly bright objects 10 billion or so
light years away from Earth, was missing frequencies characteristic
of what would be absorbed by hydrogen in its path.
   The cloud emits a strong radio signal, but there are no stars
associated with it, and it does not show up in optical surveys.
   Though 10 times larger than the Milky Way, it has only 10 percent
of the mass of that galaxy and it isn't clear whether the cloud will
evolve into a galaxy, the astronomers said.
   The cloud, south of the Virgo cluster, consists of two large
clumps of gas that may be merging, they said.
   A full report will appear in the Astrophysical Journal.

<HEAD>Scientists Announce Discovery of Most Distant Galaxy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers on Monday announced the discovery
of the most distant galaxy known, a cluster of stars 15 billion
light years away that formed long before the Earth and the sun.
   ``This is very unusual and very rare,'' said Ken Chambers of
Johns Hopkins University, one of the co-discovers. ``We're seeing
something from before the Earth formed, possibly before our own
galaxy, and when the universe was very different than today.''
   The distant galaxy, known as 4C41.17, is far too faint to be
seen by the eye, but it emits a radio signal a billion times more
powerful than the sun's radio signal.
   ``It is one of the most powerful radio galaxies we know of,''
said Chambers.
   Though the galaxy was located by radio signals, its distance
from Earth was established by analyzing the optical spectrum, or
type of light, put out by the galaxy.
   Chambers said the galaxy puts out a sharp optical signal of the
type characteristic of hydrogen and carbon. The wavelength of the
emission, however, is stretched by movement away from the observer.
   This stretch causes the light color to shift toward red, the
so-called ``red shift.'' By measuring this shift, the astronomers
could calculate the distance of the galaxy.
   A red shift of 3.8 found for 4C41.17 shows that it is about 15
billion light years away. A light year is the distance light
travels in a year, about 5.8 trillion miles.
   Chambers said at 15 billion light years, the galaxy is about 90
percent of the distance to what is thought to be the edge of the
universe. He said it also gives a view back in time and the galaxy
as seen now is only few billion years after the Big Bang, the
massive explosion that is thought to have started the universe
expanding outward.
   The galaxy is thought to be ``primitive,'' or in an early stage
of formation, Chambers said.
   ``To be able to study the dynamics as it is forming will tell us
a lot of how galaxies are formed,'' he said.
   The Earth and sun are thought to have formed about 4.6 billion
years ago.
   The study of the distant galaxy was announced at the 20th
assembly of the International Astronomical Union. Chambers'
co-discovers were George Miley, a European Space Agency
representative at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and Wil
van Bruegel, an astronomer at the University of California,
Berkeley.

<HEAD>Astronomers Report Finding New Dwarf Galaxy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British astronomers, searching for quasars in far
outer space, said Friday they believe they have stumbled across an
undiscovered galaxy ``in our back yard.''
   They said if their finding is confirmed, it is the first new
galaxy discovered in 35 years.
   Richard McMahon of the Cambridge University Institute of
Astronomy said he and colleague Michael Irwin discovered the very
dim, dwarf galaxy, two weeks ago. He said they are doublechecking
to make sure no one spotted it before.
   ``It's a bit like discovering a new planet; it's an exciting
discovery,'' McMahon said. ``We usually work in a more distant part
of the universe, and we pretty much assume that everything is
already known about the vicinity of the Milky Way'' _ the galaxy
around Earth.
   The scientists used a seven-ton, computerized laser machine that
scans detailed photographic plates of space.
   ``After the plates are scanned, the data are computerized to
look for more subtle variations,'' McMahon said. ``All the easy
galaxies have been found by the eye; the machine finds the harder
ones. The nearer ones are not so easy to see because the bright
background of the Milky Way blurs the picture.''
   The galaxy, named Sextans after the constellation where it was
found, is the smallest of the 10 satellite galaxies of the Milky
Way, the astronomers said in telephone interviews.
   The dwarf, spherical galaxy is 100,000 times fainter than the
Milky Way and cannot be seen without a powerful telescope, they
said.
   ``The sun is 30,000 light-years from the center of the Milky
Way, and this particular galaxy is a factor of 10 farther out. The
edge of the visible universe is about 15,000 million light-years
away, so this is basically in our back yard,'' Irwin said.
   A light-year is the distance that light travels in a vacuum in
one year.
   The scientists said they will follow up their finding with a
more detailed study of Sextans. They predicted that five or six
more galaxies would be found within the next three years.
   ``The odds are there won't be too many more found. If we find
them, fine; if we don't, it's all right, as long as we keep
churning out the unusual stuff,'' said Irwin, adding that he and
McMahon consider themselves specialists in quasars, not galaxies.
   Quasars are starlike objects that emit huge amounts of light.
They are thought to be the ancient traces of the exploding origins
of new galaxies.

<TEXT>
   The discovery of a river of gas flowing toward the
middle of the Milky Way supports the belief that an infinitely dense
speck more massive than 1 million suns lies at the heart of the
Earth's galaxy, astronomers say.
   The speck is known as a black hole, collapsed stars with such
intense gravitational pull that nothing can escape from it, not even
light. While many astronomers believe that a massive black hole
exists at the core of the Milky Way, this has still not been proven.
   In research presented Tuesday, astronomers described their
discovery of a 90-trillion-mile-long stream of gas that apparently
is being sucked across the heavens into the black hole.
   Although black holes cannot be seen, astronomers look for other
evidence of their existence, such as the tug of their gravity on
nearby celestial objects.
   Paul Ho, who directed the research at the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, noted that the galaxy's center
is a gravitational well.
   ``We think that stars drift toward the center,'' he said. ``It's
a natural place for a massive black hole to form.''
   Ho's radio telescope observation was made with astronomers from
the Max Planck Institute in Munich and the University of Cologne,
both in West Germany, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The report was presented at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society here.
   ``This is a complex region,'' Bonnerd J. Teegarden of NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said of the study.
``Results like these are adding a lot to our understanding.''
   Teegarden said that most astronomers believe that a massive black
hole exists at the center of the Milky Way.
   He noted that the nature of this and other black holes is one of
the most exciting areas of research and speculation in astronomy.
   ``It pushes hard on the basic concepts of physics,'' he said.
``Physicists don't really know what happens when you collapse a
million solar masses of matter down to a point. The laws of physics,
as we know them in the laboratory, are inadequate to explain such an
extreme situation.''
   Earlier, astronomers have spotted signs of a massive gaseous
cloud spinning around the Milky Way's center, which is 30,000 light
years from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius. A light year is 6
trillion miles, the distance light travels in a year.
   Scientists believe the cloud is circling a black hole that is 1
million times more massive than the sun. They theorize that parts of
the cloud constantly fall into the black hole.
   Perhaps the equivalent of one-thousandth of the mass of the sun
spirals into the black hole each year. This produces tremendous
amounts of kinetic energy, the energy released by motion.
   ``These black holes could be the most powerful generators that we
know about,'' said Ho.
   Astronomers believe that black holes provide the energy of
quasars, enormously powerful radio emitters that are the most
distant objects in the universe.
   The latest discovery suggests that a stream of gas snakes across
space, providing the fuel that keeps the Milky Way's black hole
going.
   Ho believes that a recent stellar explosion, called a supernova,
knocked loose part of a large nearby island of gas. This, in turn,
was grabbed by the gravity of the black hole and pulled in a stream
into its own orbiting cloud.

<HEADLINE>  FLAWED HUBBLE STILL PRODUCING
TELESCOPE SPOTS MASSIVE STAR, STARTS MEASURE
OF UNIVERSE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But scientists at the American Astronomical Society meeting here said the
Hubble must be repaired to get its full scientific value. One researcher said
about 80 percent of his studies had been canceled because of the telescope's
problems.;    Hubble was launched in April and engineers later discovered that
a mirror on the telescope was ground to the wrong prescription, giving a
slightly out-of-focus view.;    The flaw, however, has little effect on a
Hubble instrument called the high resolution spectrograph. And Sally Heap, a
NASA astronomer, said the instrument has studied the most massive star ever
measured precisely.;    Heap said the star, called Melnick 42, is about 100
times larger than the Earth's sun and shines about a million times brighter.; 
  Every 100,000 years, she said, Melnick 42 boils away gas with a mass equal
to the sun, creating a "stellar wind" that moves away at more than 6 million
miles an hour.;    Melnick 42 is in a galaxy about 170,000 light-years from
Earth. A light-year is about 5.8 trillion miles.;    "We couldn't have made
these measurements without the Hubble," Heap said.;    She said the space
telescope's spectrograph will be used to survey stars in a number of galaxies
to learn how stars form in different parts of the heavens.;    "Stars in other
galaxies may form in different ways because the chemistry of the galaxies is
different," she said. "It is like sampling from different cultures.";    Nino
Panagia of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore said the
Hubble's faint object camera had been able to make the most accurate
measurements of the distance between the Earth and a star outside the Milky
Way galaxy.;    Panagia said that by measuring light from different parts of a
ring that has formed around an exploded star called supernova 1987A, he has
been able to determine the distance from Earth at 169,000 light-years. That's
twice as accurate as measurements taken from ground instruments, he said.;   
The work, he said, is the first step toward determining precisely the scale of
the universe. The study will be used to calibrate other measurements taken on
stars deeper and deeper into the universe, Panagia said.;    Jeff Hester of
the California Institute of Technology said Hubble's wide-field camera had
been used to make unprecedented photos of a star called Eta Carina that may be
on the brink of exploding.;    Images collected from the star were processed
through a computer to remove Hubble's focusing flaw, and clearly shows it's
spewing material and is surrounded by a halo-like cloud structure.  </TEXT>

   Scientists say they've spotted the
farthest and oldest object ever seen, a quasar that gives a peek of
the universe near the beginning of time and challenges a popular
theory of how stars developed.
   The star-like body, about 14 billion light years from Earth,
possibly has illuminated like a flashlight in the fog the matter
that spawned everything from galaxies to life itself, according to
scientists.
   ``Astronomers have looked for more than 20 years for this
primordial stuff of which galaxies, stars and then us were
formed,'' said astrophysicist John Bahcall of the Institute for
Advanced Study. ``One possible interpretation is that it's been
found.''
   The object was seen through the 200-inch Hale Telescope at
Palomar Observatory, northeast of San Diego. The quasar is in the
constellation Ursa Major just below the Big Dipper's bowl.
   ``We've found the most distant object on record,'' said
astronomer Maarten Schmidt of the California Institute of
Technology. ``We are now seeing an object as it was a little over 1
billion years after the beginning of the universe.''
   Schmidt and astronomers James Gunn of Princeton University and
Donald Schneider of the Institute for Advanced Study, an
independent research center in Princeton, N.J., report the
discovery in December's Astronomical Journal. The find was to be
formally announced today.
   Quasars, as large as our solar system, are the brightest objects
in the universe. The brightest emits more light than 1,000 galaxies
of 100 billion stars each.
   Astronomers believe quasars form near black holes in the centers
of galaxies. Black holes are so massive their gravity sucks in even
light. But as matter is pulled in, intense bursts of light also are
emitted.
   Scientists say a gigantic explosion, the ``Big Bang,'' created
the universe 10 billion to 20 billion years ago. They usually cite
15 billion years as the universe's age.
   On that scale, the newly discovered quasar formed at least 14
billion years ago, meaning its distance from Earth is 14 billion
light years, or 82 trillion billion miles. One light year equals
5.88 trillion miles, the distance light travels in one year.
   If the universe is 20 billion years old, Schmidt said the quasar
would be about 18.5 billion light years away, or 109 trillion
billion miles from Earth.
   The discovery is ``striking, unexpected and very significant''
because it suggests the first galaxies and stars developed much
faster than can be explained by what is known as the ``cold, dark
matter'' theory, said Bahcall.
   The theory says that ``cold, dark matter,'' or hydrogen gas,
clumped together because of gravity to form stars and galaxies over
several billion years, not merely 1 billion years, Bahcall said
during a phone interview.
   Schneider said advocates of the theory may ``have to come up
with (new) theories that make galaxies faster.''
   Alternatively, light from the quasar may be partially blocked by
clouds of gas, but not primordial gas, which was uniformly
distributed in the young universe, Bahcall said.
   Because the age of the universe is uncertain, scientists measure
a quasar's absolute age and distance using a property called ``red
shift.''
   Just as a train whistle seems to shift to a lower pitch as a
train moves away from a listener, light from distant quasars shifts
toward the color red as they move away from Earth while the
universe expands.
   The newly found quasar has a red shift of 4.73, making it 7
percent older and more distant than the previous record holder, a
quasar with a red shift of 4.43 whose discovery was announced in
December 1987 by scientists in Arizona and England.
   The quasar is so distant that its light is 400,000 times too
faint to be seen by eye.
   Schmidt devised the idea of using the Hale Telescope to search
for distant quasars. Gunn built an extremely sensitive electronic
camera that made the search possible, while Schneider designed a
computer program that recognized the distinguished quasars from
hundreds of thousands of other objects.
   ``It's a fantastic technical achievement, a tour de force,''
Bahcall said.

   The disk-shaped Milky Way galaxy is not flat, but
resembles instead a warped phonograph record and is adorned with a
delicate, scalloped edge, new observations show.
   ``The scalloping is something we don't understand,'' Leo Blitz,
an astronomer at the University of Maryland, said Saturday.
   Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, Blitz said, ``Our picture of the galaxy
has changed significantly in the last five to 10 years.''
   The Milky Way, once considered merely a typical example of a
spiral galaxy, is now thought to be a much more exciting and
interesting aggregation. Among the recent findings reported
Saturday were:
   _ Ninety percent of the galaxy is invisible, and nobody knows
what this huge ``dark halo'' is made of.
   _ The galaxy is powered by two compact objects at its center
that might be the remnants of starburst formation or that could be
associated with a black hole.
   _ The galaxy's dark halo could be full of remnants of the big
bang called weakly interactive massive particles _ or WIMPs.
   The galaxy consists of a slim star-studded disk about 100,000
light-years across, Blitz said. (A light year is about 6 trillion
miles.)
   Surrounding that visible disk is a cloud of hydrogen gas
extending another 25,000 light-years.
   It is at the edge of that gaseous disk that radio astronomers
have found warping and scalloping, Blitz said.
   Beyond that lies 90 percent of the mass of the galaxy. It is
invisible, and astronomers don't know what it is, said Martin Rees
of Cambridge University.
   It could be made of a trillion very small, faint stars, each
one-tenth the size of the sun. Another possibility is that it is
composed of black holes, the remnants of massive stars.
   Or it could be made of WIMPs, an explanation that Rees said is
more radical than the others.
   ``What we want to do is narrow down the possibilities,'' Rees
said. ``What we see is a trace of sediment in a universe where
galaxies in a cosmic sea are dominated by this missing matter.''
   The galaxy's oddities are not limited to its outer edges,
however. ``The inner 10 percent of our galaxy seems to be unique,''
said Leonid Ozernoy of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. ``The star density is huge there.''
   It is also a powerful source of radiation, emitting infrared,
X-rays and gamma rays, Ozernoy said.
   A black hole could lie at the center of the galaxy, driving its
rotation. Such a black hole ``could be the remnant of starburst
formation,'' Ozernoy said.
   Observations yet to be made could resolve some of the puzzles
that remain, Rees said.
   It might be possible, he said, to use gravitational lenses _
areas in space in which gravity bends light in the same way that a
magnifying glass does _ to see small, faint stars in the dark halo,
if they exist.
   Experiments are being planned in the United States and Europe to
try to identify the WIMPs, if they exist, Rees said.
   The problem of missing mass is one that extends across the
entire universe, not only in the Milky Way, Rees said, and the
discovery of new particles in this invisible matter would have a
payoff ``so colossal that the modest investment in such experiments
seems more than justified,'' Rees said in his prepared remarks.

Giant "blobs" of material have been discovered around a mysterious object near 
the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, leading scientists to believe they may be 
getting their best look yet at one of the most baffling objects in the universe 
-- a black hole. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't possible to actually see a black hole, and no one has been able to 
prove that they exist, because a black hole would be so dense that even light 
would not escape its gravity. 
</P>
<P>
But black holes exist in theory -- and probably in fact -- as part of the 
legacy of Albert Einstein. Despite years of searching, they remain the most 
elusive trophies in the astronomical zoo. 
</P>
<P>
But armed with increasingly powerful tools, including giant radio telescopes, 
scientists believe that they are getting closer to proving that black holes do 
exist, even if they cannot be seen. 
</P>
<P>
The search consists mainly of looking for evidence of the kind of violent 
activity that should take place in a black hole's immediate neighborhood. 
Theoretically, as the black hole captures material within its gravitational 
reach, atoms and molecules literally should be ripped apart, sending out 
various types of radiation that can be studied from as far away as Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, scientists told the American Astronomical Society meeting here that 
they believe that they have identified a series of giant "blobs" -- most likely 
clouds of hot, charged gas particles -- around an object known as Sagittarius 
A, which had been discovered previously by an infrared telescope. 
</P>
<P>
The "blobs," they said, were probably created when matter was ripped apart as 
it plunged toward the black hole. Each of the giant blobs measures nearly a 
trillion miles in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
They hope that additional study will unmask Sagittarius A and prove it to be 
the long-sought but never seen black hole that scientists suspect lurks at the 
heart of the Milky Way Galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
The research is being carried out by Farhad Yusef-Zadeh of Northwestern 
University in Evanston, Ill., Mark Morris of UCLA and Ron Ekers of the 
Australian Telescope. Their main tool in the search for the black hole is the 
Very Large Array, a series of large radio telescopes in the New Mexico desert.

"This is the first time we have seen these blobs," Yusef-Zadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
Yusef-Zadeh said he cannot tell yet if the blobs are being pulled toward 
Sagittarius A or blown away by hot gases similar to the solar wind. But he is 
confident that the research he presented Wednesday goes a long way toward 
proving that a black hole does lie at the center of any galaxy, and in our own 
Milky Way, the most likely candidate is Sagittarius A. 
</P>
<P>
One problem that has been particularly vexing for astronomers is that the 
central area of the galaxy is so clouded with dust and gas that it is not 
possible to see objects near the galactic center. Thus observations are limited 
primarily to radiation that can pass through the dusty shield, such as radio 
waves and X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
So for the last few years, scientists have used giant radio telescopes to study 
the galactic center, and their search for the black hole has been generally 
narrowed to two objects. One is a tight cluster of stars, called IRS 16, and 
the other is Sagittarius A. 
</P>
<P>
Yusef-Zadeh presented evidence Wednesday that he said strongly supports 
Sagittarius as the prime candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The most compelling evidence in addition to the blobs, he said, is a cloud of 
dust and gas that surrounds a nearby star, called IRS 7. "'Radiographs," which 
are similar to photographs, produced by the scientists show that the cloud of 
dust is being swept past the star much the same as the tail of a comet is 
pushed back by the solar wind. 
</P>
<P>
The cloud is pointing directly away from Sagittarius A, just as the tail of a 
comet points away from the sun. That indicates that powerful interstellar winds 
-- such as those expected to be produced by a very energetic object such as a 
black hole -- are in fact coming from Sagittarius A. That clearly suggests that 
Sagittarius is the black hole that scientists have been looking for, 
Yusef-Zadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists, who are at the forefront in the search for a black hole at the 
center of the Milky Way, have been alloted time on an even larger radio 
telescope, called the Very Large Baseline Array, which is under construction in 
New Mexico. Yusef-Zadeh said he hopes that powerful instrument, which actually 
will consist of many telescopes linked together so that they will act as one, 
will finally resolve the issue.

   A 90 trillion-mile-long stream of gas is flowing
toward the center of the Milky Way, perhaps fueling a massive black
hole at the very heart of the Earth's galaxy, astronomers reported
Tuesday.
   Researchers said their discovery is the first evidence of a thin
river of gas being sucked across the heavens by the awesome gravity
of a black hole.
   The radio telescope observation, made by an international team,
provides new support for the still-controversial idea that a massive
black hole exists at the center of the Milky Way.
   ``That is the gravitational well of the galaxy. We think that
stars drift toward the center. It's a natural place for a massive
black hole to form,'' said Paul Ho, who directed the research at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge. He
reported the results Tuesday at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society.
   A black hole is what remains when stars collapse upon themselves,
leaving only a speck of infinite density. Their gravitational pull
is so strong that nothing escapes, not even light.
   Even though black holes cannot be seen, astronomers look for
other evidence of their existence, such as the gravitational tug on
nearby celestial orbs.
   Ho's discovery, made with astronomers from the Max Planck
Institute in Munich, the University of Cologne, West Germany, and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, may prove to be such
evidence in the Earth's galaxy.
   Astronomers had earlier spotted signs of a massive gaseous cloud
around the Milky Way's center, which is about 30,000 light years
from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius. A light year is 6
trillion miles, the distance light travels in a year.
   Experts believe that this cloud is swirling around a black hole
that is 1 million times more massive than the sun. They theorize
that parts of the cloud constantly tumble into the black hole.
   Perhaps the equivalent of one-thousandth of the mass of the sun
is drawn into the black hole each year. This produces tremendous
amounts of kinetic energy, the energy released by motion.
   ``These black holes could be the most powerful generators that we
know about,'' said Ho.
   The latest discovery suggests that a stream of gas snakes across
space, providing the fuel that keeps the Milky Way's black hole
going. Ho believes that recent stellar explosion knocked loose part
of a large island of gas. This, in turn, was grabbed by the gravity
of the black hole and pulled in a stream into its own orbiting cloud.
   ``This is a complex region,'' said Bonnerd J. Teegarden of the
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. ``Results like these
are adding a lot to our understanding.''
   Teegarden said that most, but not all, astronomers believe that a
massive black hole exists at the Milky Way's center.
   The nature of black holes ``pushes hard on the basic concepts of
physics,'' he said. ``Physicists don't really know what happens when
you collapse a million solar masses of matter down to a point. The
laws of physics, as we know them in the laboratory, are inadequate
to explain such an extreme situation.''

   The violence of early star formation in
new galaxies may be a major source of cosmic X-rays, a mysterious
radiation that has puzzled astronomers for decades, two Columbia
University scientists said Friday.
   Astrophysicists David Helfand and Thomas Hamilton said they have
found seven galaxies reasonably near the Earth's own Milky Way
galaxy that are spewing out X-rays at a hotter rate than the
so-called background X-rays detectable all over the universe.
   Though they only found seven such galaxies, the scientists said
that further searches may reveal many more, showing perhaps that
such galaxies provide a high percentage of the cosmic X-rays in the
universe.
   ``These galaxies are representative of a larger population at a
greater distance that makes up (or emits) the bulk of the X-ray
background,'' said Hamilton. ``These that we see are only the
nearest neighbors.''
   The galaxies are called ``neighbors,'' said Helfand, because
``they are relatively nearby, only a couple of billion light
years'' away.
   This is considered close, astronomically.
   A light year is the distance that light travels in space in a
year, about 6 trillion miles.
   The discovery of X-ray emitting galaxies so close and seemingly
undergoing star formation, Helfand said, suggests that in the
history of the universe star formation continued up until
relatively recently. Most astronomers believe that star formation
took place in the early part of the 15 to 20 billion-year-old
universe and then tailed off.
   ``These galaxies may be bright X-ray sources because they are
undergoing an early stage of their evolution and still forming
massive stars,'' said Helfand. ``They may be a key link in being
able to study the evolution of galaxies.''
   X-rays are thought to be generated naturally in the universe
when interstellar gas is heated to millions of degrees. Such
heating can occur during the course of star formation when vast
amounts of matter are attracted to a core by gravitational force.
Black holes, bodies massive enough to create a gravitational field
that keeps even light from escaping, can also generate X-rays by
pulling material from nearby stars, Helfand said.
   X-rays cannot be detected on Earth, which is shielded by the
atmosphere. But satellites orbiting above the atmosphere can
measure the radiation.
   To find the X-ray emitters, Helfand and Hamilton gathered data
on 100 faint radio sources in a region of the sky about the size of
the full moon. These sources were then checked to see if they
coincided with X-ray hot spots that had been discovered by
satellites. Seven of the radio emitters were found to be bright in
X-rays, and these later were found by optical telescopes to be very
faint galaxies.
   Helfand and Hamilton presented their study at the 175th national
meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

   Astronomers have discovered a galaxy 15 billion light years from Earth, one of the most distant galaxies ever seen, it was announced today by the Space Telescope Science Institute. 

   The galaxy, named 4C41.17, was discovered by scientists using a new search strategy. 
It was located because of the enormous power and peculiar spectrum of its radio emissions. 

   The galaxy is more than 90% of the distance to the visible limits of the universe, the announcement said. 

   The discovery was made by Ken Chambers, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, and George Miley, astronomy professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands who was stationed at the telescope science institute in Baltimore by the European Space Agency. 
They made their observations with Wil van Breugel, an astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley. 

   Extremely distant galaxies are of great interest to astronomers. 
Because light from them takes billions of years to reach the Earth, remote galaxies can be used to provide data about the early stages of the universe. 
The record distance of the new galaxy means it is being seen only about a few billion years after the big bang, which many scientists believe marked the beginning of the observable universe. 

   The announcement was made in Baltimore at the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union.

   A photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope
shows a galaxy seen only as fuzzy ball by telescopes on Earth is
actually so tightly packed with stars that it may harbor a black
hole at its center, NASA said Wednesday.
   The picture, which an official said was taken ``to prove to the
public that the Hubble is not broken,'' shows a galaxy 400 times
more tightly packed with stars than the sun's own Milky Way galaxy.
   Scientists said the Hubble photo captured more detail of the
galaxy than is possible by Earthbound telescopes and was thus able
to determine that the stellar group had many more stars than
expected.
   The picture was taken by the wide field-planetary camera on
Hubble, one of the instruments officials said was seriously
affected by a focusing flaw manufactured into the telescope but not
discovered until after it was launched.
   Officials also released a photo taken with another Hubble camera
that shows a ring of matter encircling a supernova, a star that
exploded in the southern sky in 1987. The ring of material had not
been spotted before by telescopes on Earth.
   Tod R. Lauer, an astronomer with the National Optical Astronomy
Observatories, said the compact galaxy of stars discovered by the
Hubble ``is vastly denser than we expected this galaxy to be.''
   He said ground-based photos of the galaxy showed a smooth blob
of light and gave no suggestion that it contained so many stars.
   ``We've never been able to study any galaxy outside of our local
group (two dozen galaxies near the Milky Way) at this resolution
before,'' Lauer said.
   The galaxy, called NGC7457, is 40 million light years away and
contains about 30,000 stars within an area of only about nine light
years.
   Hubble chief scientist Ed Weiler said that one explanation for
such a dense galaxy would be the presence of a black hole.
   ``We're not claiming that this is a black hole,'' he said at a
news conference. ``It is not inconsistent with a black hole,
however.''
   Astronomy theory holds that a black hole can be formed when
stellar matter collects in such a mass of such density and of such
a high gravitational force that even light cannot escape.
   There have been no confirmed black holes found in the universe,
but Weiler said that if one existed it might take on the appearance
of the galaxy photographed by the Hubble.
   Weiler said the galaxy will be further studied by Hubble
instruments to determine if it does contain a black hole.
   The other photo released showed a glowing ring encircling
supernova 1987A, an exploded star 160,000 light years from Earth.
   The picture was taken by Hubble's faint object camera, an
instrument made the European Space Agency for the space telescope.
   Nino Panagia, a ESA scientist, said the photo shows that matter
ejected from the star years before its explosion was compacted and
then set aglow by the burst of light when the star blew up. He said
the ring will be blow apart within a few years when the blast wave
from the exploding collides with the material in the ring.
   NASA took the pictures as part of a campaign to demonstrate that
the Hubble is a valuable telescope even though it has flawed optics.
   Eric Chaisson, educational director of the Space Telescope
Science Institute in Baltimore, said he wrote memos in recent weeks
calling for a campaign to change the perception of the public and
of the science community about the problems with Hubble.
   In a memo obtained by the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News,
Chaisson said action should be taken to change the public image of
the $1.6 billion observatory.
   ``Unless a dramatic campaign is mounted to share with the
American public the technical truth with a positive spin,''
Chaisson wrote, ``then we should prepare ourselves for an endless
stream of newspaper cartoons, late-night TV talk-show jokes and
blistering post-mortems by columnists the world over.''
   He added: ``We shall continue to see an erosion of public
support for NASA's ambitious space program.''
   Reached by telephone, Chaisson confirmed that he had written
such a memo, noting that the pictures of the galaxy and supernova
were taken in part because of his efforts.
   ``We needed some science to prove to the public that Hubble is
not broken,'' he said. ``I don't apologize for it. What I was
trying to do (with the memo) was to jerk the system around so it
would do a little science.''
   Since Hubble has been launched, it has been in a shakedown
operation designed to test it capabilities. Since the focusing flaw
was found, engineers have been operating the Hubble to find out the
precise nature of the malfunction.
   Chaisson said his memo helped persuade NASA to interrupt the
engineering checkout and take some pictures of scientific value.

ASTRONOMY: A NEWLY DISCOVERED SHEET OF GALAXIES STRETCHES FOR 500 MILLION 
LIGHT-YEARS. HARVARD SCIENTISTS CALL THEIR DISCOVERY THE GREAT WALL.

<P>
Scientists have discovered the largest structure seen so far in the universe, a 
narrow sheet of galaxies stretching more than half a billion light years across 
space. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists, who have pioneered in the effort to determine the large-scale 
structure of the universe by creating three-dimensional images of space, have 
called their discovery the Great Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Geller and John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
Astrophysics in Cambridge said the string of galaxies is 500 million 
light-years long, 200 million light-years wide, and about 15 million 
light-years thick. (A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, about 
6 trillion miles.) They reported their discovery in today's issue of the 
journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall is more than 200 million light-years away from Earth, and it 
cannot be seen with the unaided eye. In fact, it does not even show up in 
normal astronomical photographs because it is revealed only through a 
three-dimensional effect. 
</P>
<P>
Geller and Huchra are engaged in an ambitious research project that has 
revolutionized the thinking on the shape of outer space. By measuring the 
distance between Earth and 10,000 galaxies in a pie-shaped wedge of the 
northern celestial hemisphere, they have been able to plot the galaxies with a 
computer and they have produced some startling results. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago they announced that their first three-dimensional image revealed 
that the universe is structured around giant voids that look somewhat like soap 
bubbles in a dishpan. Galaxies are strung along the skin of the "bubbles," and 
scientists have debated fiercely over how the bubbles could have been created. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the bubbles are huge, measuring 150 million light-years in diameter. 
That is so big that scientists are at a loss to explain how the matter that 
makes up galaxies could have been swept clear of such a large area in the 10 to 
20 billion years since the universe was born. 
</P>
<P>
Early explanations, including the suggestion that massive explosions sent 
matter flying out from the center of the voids to create the bubble effect, 
have not gained acceptance because scientists cannot explain how matter could 
have traveled far enough to create the giant voids in the lifetime of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement only adds to the mystery and was described by the two 
scientists as "one of the most sobering results" of their research. 
</P>
<P>
It may well be that there are even much larger structures waiting to be 
discovered, further complicating the lives of cosmologists who are already 
struggling to explain why the universe should have enormous areas that are 
devoid of galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
"The size of the largest structures we detect is limited only by the extent of 
the survey," Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
Although earlier attempts to determine the structure of the universe suggested 
in the 1970s that space had some areas that were devoid of galaxies, Geller and 
Huchra were the first to carry the surveys far enough into space to see the 
large-scale structures, including the bubbles and the Great Wall. 
</P>
<P>
They have used the 60-inch telescope at the Smithsonian's Whipple Observatory 
on Mt. Hopkins, Ariz., to measure the "red shift" of galaxies in a pie-shaped 
"slice of the universe." As a galaxy speeds away from the Earth, the light it 
emits is shifted to the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. By measuring 
the red shift, the scientists are able to determine the distance to the 
galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
The first results suggested that voids were present. Subsequent surveys, 
looking twice as far into space as previous efforts, revealed that the patterns 
continued farther out. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall became a distinct structure as the scientists finished their 
fourth "slice of the universe."

   Already they're saying it's the
biggest happening in astronomy since Galileo put his eye to a
telescope.
   So, step right up folks, and discover the wonders of the
universe. See how big it is. Learn its age. Look at light created
14 billion years ago and arriving at your eye only this instant.
   Ride along to the beginning of everything, almost, to the Big
Bang of 10 or 20 thousand million years ago. See stars born and see
them die. Watch galaxies form. Follow the flow of gas into the
Milky Way's halo. Peer deep into the universe, past so many stars
in our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetime
to count, to a hundred billion other galaxies each with about 200
billion stars.
   For scientists, and then the rest of us, all that becomes
possible now that the space shuttle Discovery has carried the
Hubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen
before. The telescope, a silvery tube as long as a tanker truck,
has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faintest light.
   Light, speeding along at 186,000 miles a second, is the
messenger of creation. Tracking the trail of light from today to
the first moments contains all the information we will ever have
about the creation of the universe.
   The Hubble promises to give science an open window perhaps to
the first echoes of creation. This is a world-class event, even if
astronomy is not your thing.
   Superlatives?
   ``In the history of optical astronomy there have been two great
leaps in the resolution of the universe: Galileo's telescope in the
autumn of 1609, and the Hubble Space Telescope in April 1990.'' _
Eric J. Chaisson, a senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore.
   One more?
   ``No one ever made anything that good,'' James Westphal,
California Institute of Technology.
   Another?
   Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, predicts that the
Hubble telescope ``will literally be the dawn of a new era in
astronomy.''
   Eras rarely can be proclaimed in advance. But the HST, named
after Edwin Powell Hubble, holds that kind of promise.
   Hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the century who
concluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away from Earth
but that the farther away they are, the faster they move. The
theory of an expanding universe supported the belief that the
universe originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter is
still rushing from the site of that so-called Big Bang.
   Astronomers think the Big Bang occurred 12 billion to 20 billion
years ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incredible
speed and heat. Eventually matter cooled and condensed into
galaxies, stars and planets.
   There are bigger telescopes than the Hubble, but they are all on
Earth and all subject to a major limitation _ the atmosphere _
which is fine for breathing but lousy for seeing through. The
problem of skywatching through layers of air has been likened to
birdwatching from the bottom of a swimming pool.
   The Voyager spacecraft, which sent back astonishing views of
Earth's sister planets, had to travel 12 years to get close enough
for pictures as they whizzed past. With the Hubble, says scientist
Edward Weiler, such pictures are possible any time we want.
   The telescope is 42.5 by 14 feet and consists of a 94.5-inch
primary mirror that gathers incoming light.
   ``On a clear, dark night you can see a flashlight from two miles
away,'' says Weiler, chief NASA scientist on the Hubble project.
``With a 28-power telescope you can see it on the moon 250,000
miles away. With the HST you could see a firefly in Australia from
Washington.''

<TEXT>
   Astronomers have discovered a gigantic
collection of galaxies that they say is the biggest structure ever
seen in the universe.
   The structure, which they call the Great Wall, is so difficult
to explain that it raises new questions about theories of the
origin and structure of the universe.
   The researchers reported their discovery in Friday's issue of
the journal Science.
   The galaxies that make up the Great Wall form a sheet that is at
least 500 million light years long, or 3,000 billion billion miles,
and it is 200 million light years wide and 15 million light years
thick.
   By comparison, the earth's Milky Way galaxy is 100,000 light
years across. The entire universe is thought to be between 10
billion and 20 billion light years across.
   The Great Wall was discovered by Margaret Geller and John Huchra
of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge in
a detailed three-dimensional map they have been compiling of a
section of the heavens. The structure is so big that it appears to
run off the edges of the map.
   Geller said no one knows of a force that could have produced a
structure so big in the time since the universe was formed.
   ``My view is it's something really missing, something we really
don't understand,'' said Geller. ``It's not just a more complex
version of something we already know.''
   Astronomers say each new survey of skies turns up still bigger
structures.
   ``This is the latest chapter in a saga that's been going on
since the late 1970s,'' said Edwin Turner of Princeton University.
``We keep being surprised that we keep seeing something bigger as
we go out farther.''
   He said theories about how the universe arrived in its current
form already have been stretched by earlier discoveries, and it is
not clear whether the Great Wall ``will be the straw that broke the
camel's back.'' Virtually all current theories hold that the
universe began with a ``big bang'' about 15 billion years ago and
expanded rapidly into a highly uniform mix of matter and energy.
   In their report, the Cambridge scientists suggested building a
national observatory to extend the exploration of the universe.
They proposed a telescope with a light-gathering mirror four
meters, or 160 inches, across, giving it six times the
light-gathering power of the telescope used to find the Great Wall.
   ``With a telescope that size, you can not only look nearby, but
you can look at large enough distances where you can begin to see
how these structures really evolve,'' Geller said. ``That's one
thing we really have in our favor, that as we look out to greater
distances, we look back in time.''

<LEADPARA>  Scientists have discovered what may be the first known planet outside our
solar system -- a mysterious object, about 10 times the mass of the Earth,
orbiting a dead and distant star.;    The finding by a team of British
astronomers, reported today in the journal Nature, set astronomers buzzing.  </LEADPARA>

SCIENTISTS SAY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     If confirmed, it will challenge fundamental views of how stars and solar
systems evolve, David C. Black, director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute
in Houston, wrote in an accompanying commentary.;    Evidence for the
existence of the planet is strong, astronomers say, but they are at a loss to
explain how it got there.;    The problem: Its parent star, known as
PSR1829-10, blew up more than a million years ago in a supernova. If the
planet had been around at the time, it probably would have been destroyed or
released from orbit. And no theory exists to explain how it could have formed
in the years since.;    "I'm usually quite skeptical. But I thought this was
quite a strong case," said Douglas Lin of the University of California, Santa
Cruz, who spent Wednesday afternoon debating the new findings with a dozen
colleagues and students. "It is very exciting, very intriguing. We're
discussing various possibilities for how this thing could have formed and how
it could currently exist.";    Detecting planets around other stars is tricky.
If they exist -- and most astronomers now believe they do -- they are
relatively tiny objects lost in the glare of their respective suns, too dim to
see directly with the most powerful telescope.;    Although a number of
scientists claimed to have found indirect evidence of planets over the past
few decades, none of their discoveries has ever been confirmed.;    The latest
report came almost by accident.;    Andrew Lyne and his colleagues at the
University of Manchester were surveying a type of neutron star known as a
pulsar. It represents one of the last stages in the life cycle of a star like
our sun, which over millions of years would be expected to expand, explode in
a supernova and contract into a small, dark, extremely dense neutron star.;   
Pulsars are neutron stars that spin rapidly, giving off beams of radio waves
that sweep like beacons across space. Usually these pulses are very regular;
those from PSR1829-10 arrive three times a second. But over the past five
years, the British team noticed that the rate varied slightly, slowing down
and speeding up on a regular six-month cycle.;    The team concluded that
something must be orbiting the pulsar, and that its gravitational attraction
was alternately tugging the pulsar toward and away from Earth. The object
would be about 10 times the mass of the Earth and in a circular orbit, about
as far away from the pulsar as Venus is from the sun. The most reasonable
candidate, members said, would be a planet, and it is possible that longer
observation will reveal more planets around the same pulsar.;    If a planet
is indeed there, Lin said, it most likely would have formed after the
supernova explosion -- perhaps from material ejected in the explosion that
fell back toward the star and whirled into a disk that congealed into chunks
of rock.;    In any case, it is extremely unlikely that such a planet would
harbor life, said Geoffrey Marcy, an astronomer at San Francisco State
University who is conducting his own planetary search at Lick Observatory on
Mount Hamilton.;    "A pulsar is a dead neutron star that's already lived its
life and used up all its nuclear energy," he said. "So prospects for life as
we know it are actually zero, I would say."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Astronomers From Virginia and Australia Find What May Be Brown
Dwarf Star</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers have identified for the first time
what they believe is a brown dwarf star, a stellar body that lacks
the mass to trigger the fusion reaction that gives stars their
brilliant light.
   The National Science Foundation announced Thursday that Philip
A. Ianna of the University of Virginia and Michael S. Bessell of
the Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories in Australia identified
the candidate brown dwarf after taking measurements of its
brightness and mass.
   Visible only in the skies of the southern hemisphere, the dim,
red stellar body equals about 5 percent of the mass of the sun. The
sun emits about 4,000 times more light than the dwarf.
   The dwarf is in the Milky Way, the galaxy which includes the
sun, and is about 68 light-years away, the astronomers said. A
light-year is the distance light travels in a year, a bit less than
6 trillion miles.
   Brown dwarfs have been theorized to exist for years with most
experts predicting they would have 7 percent to 8 percent of the
mass of the sun.
   This would not be sufficient mass for gravitational forces to
compress it and heat it to the point where its hydrogen fuses into
helium. Without fusion, such a stellar body would give off only a
faint red glow caused by its modest gravitational compression.
   Ianna and Bessell said they found the candidate brown dwarf by
studying a group of very, very faint stars first discovered by
Michael R. S. Hawkins of the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh,
Scotland.
   ``We have measured the distance from Earth to what seemed like
the dimmest of these stars and found that the star is truly
faint,'' Ianna said in a statement released by the foundation.
``This supports the hypothesis that this whole group of stars is
faint and contains other brown dwarf candidates.''
   Some astronomers have suggested that brown dwarfs may be the
so-called missing matter of the universe.
   The missing matter question arose when astronomers studying the
movement of stars and galaxies concluded that gravitation forces
acting on visible stellar bodies are too great to be explained by
the mass of the observed objects in space. Some believe that up to
90 percent of the matter in the universe is not seen. Brown dwarfs,
it has been proposed, could be part of the undetected matter.
   There is also a theory that the missing mass is cold, dark
matter such as interstellar molecules, black holes and a subatomic
particles called neutrinos, which cannot be observed.
   Ianna and Bessell studied the candidate brown dwarf using an
electronic camera on the one-meter telescope at the Siding Spring
Observatory.
   Sighting from two different perspectives within the Earth's
orbit of the sun, the scientists were able to calculate the
distance of the object from Earth. The mass of the object was
estimated based on studies of its luminosity, or brightness.

   The picture had no particular scientific
value, but astronomers were still ``hopping up and down'' with
excitement over the first photo taken by whtt will soon be the
world's most powerful optical telescope.
   Scientists said the $94.2 million Keck Telescope at Mauna Kea,
Hawaii, will peer deeper into space than ever before and yield
clues to the creation of the universe.
   Astronomers on Tuesday displayed Keck's first picture, which was
taken with only a quarter of the telescope's 36 mirror segments in
place. When completed it will be the world's largest telescope with
a mirror 10 meters in diameter.
   The photo of a galaxy 65 million light years from Earth more
than matched the quality of images from the world's largest
effective telescope, the 5-meter Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar
Observatory. It was taken Nov. 24.
   ``When we first saw the picture we were really thrilled,'' said
mirror designer Jerry Nelson, an astronomer at the University of
California, Berkeley. ``We were all hopping up and down.''
   The photograph had no particular scientific value, Nelson said.
He said the galaxy NGC 1232 was selected simply to demonstrate the
quality of the telescope, which will be fully functioning late next
year.
   Astronomers said the Keck will allow them to gaze back 12
billion years in time by revealing light images still traveling
toward Earth.
   They will be able to see stars as they appeared some 3 billion
years after the birth of the universe. Palomar, by contrast,
reaches back 8 billion years.
   ``How did the Big Bang lead to the structure of the universe?''
asked William Frazer, vice chairman of the California Association
of Research in Astronomy. ``To understand that we've got to look
closer to when the galaxies first formed. This will enable us to
get closer.''
   The Keck telescope is the first to be built of automated mirror
segments. It differs from other large telescopes in that its mirror
is composed of separate hexagonal segments 6 feet in diameter. The
aluminum-coated mirrors are kept in alignment within one-millionth
of an inch by computer-controlled sensors.
   The Keck will offer research opportunities not possible with the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, which was supposed to see
farther into the universe than the Keck but has a mirror flaw that
renders it less powerful.
   NASA won't be able to fix the orbiting Hubble until 1993.
   The California Institute of Technology and the University of
California are sharing the cost of the Keck.

<HEAD>Studies Confirm `Great Attractor' Tugging on Milky Way Galaxy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Like an immense gravitational magnet, a
vast celestial structure nicknamed ``the great attractor'' is
pulling powerfully at the Milky Way and more than 100 other
galaxies, causing a dramatic distortion in the normal expansion of
the nearby universe.
   The structure has been shown in new studies to be pulling on
galaxies from across more than 100 million light years of space,
astronomer Alan Dressler said Thursday at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society.
   Dressler, with the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said he
and Sandra Faber of the University of California at Santa Cruz have
confirmed the influence of the great attractor by measuring the
movements of about 400 galaxies and comparing that motion with what
is considered normal for an expanding universe.
   More than 100 galaxies were found to have a ``peculiar motion''
that pointed toward the center of what Dressler labeled the great
attractor.
   Current theory is that the universe is expanding at a steady
rate, hence all galaxies are moving in one direction at a constant
rate. Any change in rate or direction is considered ``peculiar
motion.''
   ``The great attractor is a large area of density in which
galaxies are moving toward it from one side and toward it from the
other,'' Dressler said. ``The distortion (in motion) is very marked
and very significant.''
   Dressler said the gravitational pull of the great attractor has
added about 600 kilometers a second, or about 1.3 million miles an
hour, to the motion velocity of the galaxies it is drawing in.
   Dressler, Faber and five other astronomers, called the ``Seven
Samurai'' in the astronomy community, presented preliminary
evidence for the presence of the great attractor in 1987.
   The idea was met then with great skepticism because it went
against theories that matter formed in generally smooth patterns in
the universe.
   ``We had found a rather large lump,'' Dressler said. Their
studies then showed that only galaxies on the same side as the
Milky Way were being drawn toward the attractor.
   Since then, Dressler said, he and Faber have found many
additional star clusters also moving toward the great attractor,
including some moving from beyond the assumed location of the
structure.
   ``There is evidence now that galaxies are falling in from the
other side,'' he said.
   Measurements, he said, have determined that the great attractor
is about 500 million light years across and that the center of the
structure is about 150 million light years away from the Milky Way,
which is the home of the sun and the Earth.
   A light year is the distance in space that light will travel in
one year, about 6 trillion miles.
   Dressler said the structure stretches about 60 degrees across
the Earth's view of the sky, reaching from superclusters of
galaxies known as Hydra and Centaurus, through the plane of the
Milky Way, to the superclusters Pavo and Indus.
   The great attractor is not solid, but rather is an area where
there is a greater than average density of superclusters of
galaxies and the so-called ``dark matter,'' universal material that
cannot be seen, Dressler said. Much of the mass in the universe is
thought by astronomers to be ``dark matter.''
   The new study was presented in a paper at the 175th national
meeting of the AAS.

   Later this week, a command radioed
from Earth will open the lens cap on the Hubble Space Telescope and
allow the first light from space to strike its mirror.
   If telescopes have a most-important moment, that will be it. It
will mean that Hubble, flying free 380 miles above the world, has
opened its eyes to the heavens and is ready to make discoveries not
yet imagined.
   NASA is so concerned about that lens cap opening, it is keeping
the shuttle Discovery in the neighborhood just in case. Astronauts
Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be suited up, ready to
walk in space to open the cap _ formally called an aperture door _
by hand.
   Opening that door is step 65 in a sequence NASA laid out to
activate and check out the $1.5 billion telescope and its five
instruments before the shuttle pulls away and leaves the Hubble to
its own devices.
   The instruments themselves, mounted behind the telescope's 94.5
inch mirror, were warmed up Tuesday, soon after the shuttle lifted
into a sunny Florida sky. Their ability to communicate with the
ground was checked one-by-one.
   One of the instruments, the Wide-Field and Planetary Camera,
operates in two modes as its name implies. In the wide-field mode,
the camera can photograph a giant galaxy 60 million light years
from Earth. How far is that? Light travels 5,900,000,000,000 miles
in one year.
   With this instrument, astronomers plan to look into crowded
centers of galaxies and search for disk-shaped formations of gas
and dust around young stars where new planetary systems may be
forming. If they discover a star like our sun and planets like our
Earth, they may be on the trail of other life in the universe.
   In its planetary mode, the camera can photograph entire
hemispheres of any planet in our solar system in a single exposure.
Scientists will be able to take photographs of Neptune as sharp and
detailed as those taken by the two Voyager spacecraft when each was
only five days away.
   A second instrument is the Faint-Object Camera, provided by the
European Space Agency. It is designed to detect distant objects and
extends the reach of the telescope to the greatest possible
distance.
   This camera will photograph stars seven times farther away than
any before it. ``Many stars and galaxies that are considered faint
by present standards will be almost blazing light sources to the
Faint-Object Camera,'' says a NASA brochure.
   A third instrument, the Faint-Object Spectrograph, will analyze
the light from individual stars and nebulae in our galaxy and those
nearby and provide data to deduce their physical and chemical
properties. It will investigate more distant galaxies and study
light from quasars and whole galaxies.
   The spectrograph also will be used to study erupting stars _
supernova _ and determine the rate at which the expansion of the
universe has been slowing over billions of years.
   Its conclusions will help settle a scientific argument over
nothing less than the likely fate of the universe: If the
deceleration rate is small, then the universe will continue to
expand forever. If it is as fast as some scientists maintain, then
the expansion will come to a halt eventually and the universe will
begin to contract.
   A fourth instrument, the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph,
sees only ultraviolet light to examine physical and chemical
conditions in objects it looks at. It will be able to observe trace
substances in interstellar space that can't be detected any other
way. When the telescope is tracking a bright comet, the
spectrograph will search for evidence that comets were formed from
interstellar matter. And it will measure temperatures of explosion
in the upper atmospheres of red dwarf stars.
   The simplest instrument on the Hubble, containing no moving
parts, is the High-Speed Photometer, a light meter that measures
the intensity, wavelength and other properties of light. It will
measure the structure and ongoing physical processes in interacting
binary stars _ including those that may contain black holes.
   With this instrument, astronomers will study many of the exotic
phenomena in the ring systems of Saturn, Jupiter and Uranus and
also will determine the diameters of stars.
   There is, effectively, a sixth instrument on the Hubble _ fine
guidance sensors that point the telescope with precision. From
Washington, claim scientists, the sensors could spot a dime in the
window of the World Trade Center in Manhattan _ and hold it steady
in sight for 24 hours.

<LEADPARA>  A vast cloud of gas molecules has been detected near the fringe of the
observable universe, giving astronomers a revealing glimpse into the earliest

in the Astronomical Journal, being published this week, that the cloud had at
least 100 times the mass of the Milky Way galaxy, making it the largest such
object ever observed. And it appears to be the most distant object found to

<TEXT>     The cloud is estimated to be 12 billion light-years away, 10 times farther

and Paul Vanden Bout, both of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in
Charlottesville, Va., said the huge volume of gas being detected at such a
great distance was strong evidence that they had observed a galaxy still in
the formation process.;   The cloud is being seen as it existed about 3
billion years after the presumed birth of the universe -- the Big Bang -- and
no galaxy had ever before been caught in the act of forming so relatively
early in cosmic history.;   The observations, they also said, demonstrate that
galaxy formation is preceded by the gravitational accumulation of an enormous
reservoir of molecular gas that occurred surprisingly soon after the Big
Bang.;   In an announcement of their discovery, Brown and Vanden Bout said
Friday that the findings were "in keeping with models of galaxy formation,
never before confirmed, that galaxies form by the gravitational accumulation
of pre-existing clouds of gas."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Astronomers Discover Pulsar, Fastest-Spinning Object Ever Detected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers say they have documented the
creation of an extremely dense, spinning star known as a pulsar for
the first time, an insight that could change beliefs about how big
stars explode.
   The discovery, reported Thursday, confirms a theory that pulsars
are created by the explosion of enormous stars, called supernovas,
said Carl Pennypacker, a research physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory.
   The pulsar, a highly dense star known as a neutron star, spins
nearly 2,000 times per second, according to Pennypacker, who said
its speed is three times faster than anything researchers have
observed before.
   ``It's really phenomenal,'' he said, describing the pulsar as
``something that has the mass of the sun squished down to a
10-kilometer radius.''
   The discovery offers key information into what happens when a
supernova explodes, he said.
   ``It tells us about the birth of pulsars and the final stage of
big stars,'' Pennypacker said. ``It will probably change our sense
of what the (supernova) explosion mechanism is. I think it's going
to have a pretty profound effect.''
   Pennypacker, a researcher at LBL and the Space Sciences
Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, said the
pulsar emits light that creates ``sort of a searchlight effect.''
   The pulsar's creation was observed as part of an international
research project begun two years ago when astronomers first spotted
the parent supernova, named Supernova 1987A.
   Located about 170,000 light-years away from the Earth, the
explosion of Supernova 1987A was much closer than any other
supernova explosion in four centuries. Observers were able to watch
it with the naked eye for several months. Pennypacker called that
explosion ``probably the most exciting astronomical observation of
the decade.''
   ``We barely have an understanding of what makes these stars
explode,'' he said. ``They're neat because all the atoms in us came
from Supernova explosions. ... They're some of the brightest things
in the universe; ancients watched them.''
   When the big star's core collapsed in an enormous explosion, the
neutron star was formed, he said.
   The pulsar was detected inside the cloud of gas dust left by the
supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud near the Milky Way galaxy.
   Speculation about how fast the pulsar would spin had ranged from
two or three rotations per second to Pennypacker's guess that it
would spin at a rate of ``at least 100 times a second,'' but no one
had come close to anticipating the pulsar's spectacular speed.
   The pulsar, which will likely keep researchers busy until at
least 1995, probably existed for about two years, but debris and fog
have obscured its presence, Pennypacker said.
   Astronomers in Chile gathered the first data that documented the
discovery Jan. 18, Pennypacker said, adding that a team of about
eight researchers has been interpreting the information since then.
   More observations are expected soon from telescopes in Australia
and Chile, he said.
   The team that discovered the pulsar included scientists from the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
the Las Campanas and Cerro Tololo observatories in Chile, NASA's
Ames Research Center, the Mount Stromlo-Siding Springs Observatory
in Australia, and the Universities of Oregon and Toronto.

   Sometime next year, scientists hope to turn on a video screen, butter their popcorn and settle back to watch the dawn of the universe. 

   They won't be seeing a new George Lucas movie but rather the world's first time machine, in orbit around the Earth. 
If everything goes as planned, astronomers will come as close as anyone ever has to viewing the Creation. 

   The scientists won't see the very beginning of time, but they will see stars and galaxies as they existed 14 billion years ago. 
That's how long light from the most distant of those stars takes to reach our planet. 
It's also a scant billion years or so after the big bang -- the monumental explosion of fiery gases that astronomers theorize created the universe and started cosmic clocks ticking. 

   James Westphal, a California Institute of Technology planetary scientist, expects the time machine, formally called the Hubble Space Telescope, to provide many insights. 
"Some of the most intriguing questions for all of us," he says, "are: How did we come to be? 
How did things look after the universe formed? 
How has the universe changed?" 

   In June of next year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration intends to launch the telescope above the haze of the Earth's atmosphere. 
From there it will beam back pictures of stars and galaxies that are invisible from the ground. 
Scientists comparing these primordial objects (long since dead perhaps) with younger ones closer to home may be able to trace how the universe has evolved and better predict its future. 
Lennard Fisk, who heads NASA's space-science program, calls the telescope project "one of the premier science missions of the century." 

   The success of the scheme will depend, of course, on whether the telescope ever gets into the sky and stays there. 
A frustrated NASA has spent $1.5 billion building the machine and is five years behind schedule in launching it. 
All the telescope has seen so far is the inside of a California warehouse, where it piles up storage and maintenance bills of $8 million a month. 
And the eventual launch is fraught with peril. 
NASA must plan everything very carefully. 
Among possible mishaps: Sunspots could cause the telescope, which weighs 12 tons and is 43 feet long, to plunge to Earth like a meteor. 

   If the space telescope does get going, astronomers promise feats that are worthy of Hollywood-exploring black holes and exploding stars; searching for other life in the universe and gauging the end of time. 

   Astronomers say that the Earth's fate is sealed. 
Five billion years from now the sun will slowly swallow the Earth in a huge fireball. 
The fate of the universe is still a mystery. 
Astronomers can't tell whether the universe will expand forever, powered by the big bang of old, or whether it will someday collapse into an apocalyptic big crunch. 

   John Huchra, a Harvard University astronomer, is one of a dozen scientists who plan to spend three years using the space telescope to study the size of the universe and the speed at which it is expanding. 
By comparing the velocity of distant galaxies -- which are many billions of years old -- with that of nearer, younger galaxies, he says, scientists will be able to measure more precisely whether gravity is slowing down the universe until, someday, it will finally implode. 

   "There's a magic number that sets the scale of the universe," Mr. Huchra says. 
"Ever since 1929, people have been trying to figure this out." 
That's when Edwin Hubble, for whom the telescope is named, first tried to calculate how fast the universe is expanding beyond the Milky Way. 

   Riccardo Giacconi, the director of the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, has the most ambitious plan of all-searching for life on other planets. 
With the space telescope, he says, "We'll learn more probably if we're alone or if we have company." 

   Ground-based telescopes have never found another solar system like this one, with planets orbiting a sun. 
The brilliance of a star's light is so great and the Earth's atmosphere is so hazy that astronomers using computer graphics can see only bands of color that ring certain stars. 
Some of the those colors may imply planets; the space telescope, with its great range and clarity of vision, might be able to tell for sure. 

   NASA set up the space-telescope institute to build a computerized map of 20 million stars and to choose plans for stargazing. 
In the institute's basement, astronomers can help point the telescope, videogame-roller-ball style, by rotating a ball from side to side, and examine the exotica of the universe on a video screen receiving transmissions from the telescope. 

   Among the weirdest phenomena scientists plan to hunt for are black holes -- gravitational fields so powerful they crush stars. (Duccio Macchetto, an Italian scientist who has worked on the space telescope for 13 years, believes that a black hole the size of a "fingernail" may have struck the Earth in the early part of the century, leveling a Siberian forest.) 

   Nobody has ever seen a black hole because light can't escape from a black hole's grip. 
But astronomers theorize that odd visible patterns of light and huge jets of matter may be last gasps of stars being pulverized by black holes. 
Albert Boggess, a NASA astronomer, says the space telescope could pinpoint brilliant lights in space that may be beacons for black holes but that look fuzzy from Earth. 

   Mr. Westphal, the Cal Tech scientist who designed the telescope's $53 million camera, wants to aim it at M87, a galaxy 33 million light-years away, which has an enormous blue plume at its center -- black-hole territory, he reckons. 
"You know this black hole is only the size of the moon and it's eaten up a billion stars," he says, giggling at the thought of such gluttony. 

   Other scientists involved in the telescope project will dabble in cosmic archaeology -- comparing ancient galaxies on the rim of the universe with newer, closer ones to see how galaxies develop. 
John Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., suspects that quasars -- the most luminous objects in the sky -- are the "birth pangs or death throes" of galaxies. 
Mr. Westphal believes that galaxies grow like fish, swallowing stars and smaller galaxies as they move about, and getting bigger over time. 

   Richard Harms, who developed a space-telescope instrument to detect faint objects, will track supernova-exploding stars -- to see how quickly they decay and thereby gauge the speed of the universe. 
One likely target: the Magellanic clouds, 163,000 light-years away, which last year featured the brightest supernova seen from Earth in 383 years. 
"We'll rush to look at new ones as soon as they go off," Mr. Harms promises. 

   Before any of this neat stuff begins, however, NASA must get the space telescope into orbit on the space shuttle -- and keep it in orbit. 
All sorts of things have gone awry for the space telescope since NASA started working on it in 1977, but the biggest blow was the Challenger tragedy, which delayed the launch three years, to June 1989. 
And next summer may be an awful time to try to bring it off. 
Astronomers predict that will be near the height of the sunspot cycle, when exploding gases on the surface of the sun will push the Earth's atmosphere deeper into space -- and threaten to drag the telescope to Earth in a flaming wreck. 

   If the sunspots are as explosive as is feared, NASA will face the following difficult choice: launch the telescope so high above the atmosphere that a shuttle may not be able to reach it again for repair, or launch it low enough so subsequent shuttles can retrieve it and boost it higher every six months or so -- at a cost of about $300 million a nudge. 

   A "tiger team" of solar experts will advise NASA. James Moore, a NASA spacetelescope official, says the agency will delay the launch if sending it up on schedule means that it will then have to re-boost the telescope even once a year. 
And NASA's Mr. Fisk vows: "One decision I don't plan to make is putting the space telescope too low and having it follow me home."

   Scientists on Tuesday displayed the
first picture taken by what will soon be the world's most powerful
optical telescope, a huge instrument designed to peer deeper into
space than ever before.
   When it is completed, the $94.2 million Keck Telescope at Mauna
Kea, Hawaii, will be the world's largest, with a mirror 10 meters
in diameter. It also is the first to be built of automated mirror
segments.
   Astronomers say the Keck will enable them to gaze back 12
billion years in time by revealing light images still traveling
toward Earth.
   ``These are really time machines, given the finite speed of
light,'' said Edward Stone, chairman of the California Association
of Research in Astronomy, composed of scientists from the
California Institute of Technology and the University of
California.
   The photo of galaxy NGC 1232, taken with only a quarter of the
Keck's 36 mirror segments in place, more than matched the quality
of images from the world's largest effective telescope, the 5-meter
Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory.
   The image was taken Nov. 24 from the W.M. Keck Observatory on
Mauna Kea, a 13,796-foot volcano on the island of Hawaii.
   The picture of the galaxy, 65 million light years from Earth in
the constellation Eridanus, marks the telescope's ``first light,''
a term astronomers use to describe the first viewing through a new
telescope.
   The photo has no particular scientific value; NGC 1232 was
selected simply to demonstrate the optical quality of the
telescope, said mirror designer Jerry Nelson, an astronomer at the
University of California, Berkeley.
   ``When we first saw the picture we were really thrilled,'' said
Nelson. ``We were all hopping up and down.''
   The telescope won't be fully functioning until late next year,
with all mirror segments in place and precision cameras mounted to
record the images it returns.
   When it is completed, the Keck Telescope is expected to be twice
as powerful as the Hale and far more accurate and reliable than a
6-meter Soviet telescope that is frequently inoperable.
   The Keck differs from other large telescopes in that its mirror
is made up of separate hexagonal mirror segments 6 feet in
diameter. The aluminum-coated mirrors are kept in alignment within
1-millionth of an inch by computer-controlled sensors.
   Stone said a single-piece 10-meter-wide mirror probably could
not be constructed with existing technology.
   The telescope will offer research opportunities not possible
with the Hubble Space Telescope, launched earlier this year by a
space shuttle. Because it orbits Earth above the distorting effects
of the atmosphere, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope was
supposed to see farther into the universe than the Keck, even
though the Hubble has a smaller mirror.
   NASA discovered after it was launched that the Hubble's mirror
was flawed during construction, rendering it less powerful than
planned until a space shuttle crew can fix it in 1993.
   However, the Keck, with its large, light-gathering mirror, will
be a better instrument for analyzing the light spectrums of stars.
Stone said this will enable scientists to better understand the
nature of the stars and calculate their speed.
   By providing images that reach back 12 billion years, scientists
will see stars as they appeared some 3 billion years after the
birth of the universe. Palomar, by contrast, reaches back only 8
billion years.
   Caltech and the University of California are sharing the cost of
the telescope. Caltech, aided by a $70 million grant from the W.M.
Keck Foundation, put up the $87 million the project originally was
expected to cost. Overruns of $7.2 million will be shared by the
two universities, and UC will pay the annual operating cost of
about $3 million, Stone said.
   Nelson said Mauna Kea is considered the world's best site for a
telescope because its high altitude reduces atmospheric
distortions. But the thin air often impairs researchers' thinking
ability and causes severe headaches, he said. As a result,
operations must be carefully planned and monitored by the project's
sea-level headquarters.

   Scientists say they have made the most
detailed look at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and found what
appears to be a massive black hole gobbling up one star every 5,000
to 10,000 years.
   Computer-generated pictures released Wednesday at a American
Astronomical Society meeting show an object 1 million times the
size of the sun that seems to be spinning off what appears to be
clusters of gas, said Northwestern University astronomer Farhad
Yusef-Zadeh.
   ``This is the most detailed look at the center of our galaxy,
and it is similar, in a scaled-down version, to what we expect to
see in the nuclei of active galaxies,'' said Yusef-Zadeh in a
telephone interview Wednesday night.``Super-massive black holes are
believed to be imbedded at the center of these galaxies.''
   A black hole is believed to be an imploded star, a massive
object so dense that even light cannot escape its gravitational
pull. It is sucking in one star every 5,000 to 10,000 years, he
said. It is 25,000 light years from Earth.
   ``It's an arena where gravity has a complete triumph over all
other forces,'' he said of his research that involved three years
of observations through the Very Large Array radiotelescope.
   The pictures of the object, called Sagittarius A, show at least
seven clumps of gas surrounding it and seeming to spiral outward
from it, as if being sprayed out from something rapidly spinning.
   ``This is the first time you can actually see bloblike sources
near the galactic center,'' Yusef-Zadeh said.
   Until now, he said, it had not been clear whether Sagittarius A
or a star cluster called IRS 16 was really at the center of the
galaxy.
   ``We believe that we have good evidence that Sagittarius A is
truly at the center of our galaxy and is responsible for energizing
its immediate vicinity,'' he said.
   Although nothing can escape the interior of a black hole,
Yusef-Zadeh said that gas, dust and stars drawn toward it are
believed to form a swirling disc. The black hole's gravity,
astronomers believe, heats this material to such an extent that
some of the matter is blown back outward by the radiation pressure
and by a wind similar to solar wind.
   Scientists cannot actually see the black hole but can record the
energy spewing out from it _ an amount roughly equal to the power
that would be radiated by 10 million suns. The radiotelescope can
measure radio waves and infrared radiation.
   The study was done in collaboration with astronomers Mark
Morris, of University of California, Los Angeles, and Ron Ekers of
the Australian Telescope at Epping, Australia.

FT  25 FEB 92 / Technology: Great eye sets sights sky high - A European
project to build the world's most powerful telescope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD

<TEXT>
Before the year 2000 the clearest view of distant galaxies in the universe
will come from a European supertelescope in Chile's Atacama desert.
Eight countries - Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden,
Denmark, Italy and Switzerland - are working together at the European
Southern Observatory (ESO) to try to surpass the achievements of the US
Hubble Space Telescope. And they hope to do this for a fraction of Hubble's
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) cost.
ESO's showcase is the Very Large Telescope (VLT) project. By 1999 four large
telescopes will work in unison to capture the equivalent light of a single
16-metre instrument. The VLT will be the world's most powerful telescope,
nearly three times larger than any operating today. This great eye is
expected to cost DM450m (Pounds 156m).
The VLT's progress is creating as much excitement among astronomers as the
launch of the Hubble nearly two years ago. The Hubble space telescope,
orbiting 300 miles above the Earth's atmosphere, was expected to reveal
uncharted expanses of the universe by 'seeing' seven times deeper into space
than observatories on Earth.
However, Hubble's mission has been partially crippled by microscopic
scratches on the surface of its 2.4-metre mirror. The images being relayed
back to Earth have failed to live up to their revolutionary promise.
Hubble's misfortunes have rekindled interest in a new generation of
Earth-bound telescopes and sharpened the rivalry between US and European
astronomers.
The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy has obtained US
government backing for an eight-metre telescope in Hawaii. Two more 10-metre
telescopes in Hawaii are being financed by the private Keck Foundation.
The VLT, however, remains in a class of its own. It will allow astronomers
to explore three quarters of the universe and study galaxies perhaps as far
as 14bn light years away. The VLT will also be powerful enough to penetrate
the innermost regions of active galaxies, which may harbour black holes at
their centres. As a result astrophysicists will learn more about the
chemical composition of stars and interstellar clouds.
After gathering meteorological data for six years, ESO decided that Cerro
Paranal, 800km north of its existing 14-telescope observatory in La Silla,
was probably the best site in the world for astronomical work. Cerro Paranal
boasts perfect photometric nights for 60 per cent of the year and a very
still atmosphere. Astronomers are looking forward to unexpected discoveries.
'The universe has far more imagination than we have,' says Christoffel
Waelkens, a visiting Belgian astronomer.
The greatest technological challenge for scientists working on the VLT
project will be to cast four identical single-blank mirrors, each 8.2 metres
in diameter. Until recently this was thought to be impossible, because very
large mirrors buckle under their own weight.
But Schott Glaswerke in Germany has already cast the first 8.2-metre mirror
by pouring molten glass ceramic into a rotating concave mould. The spinning
action produced a much thinner and lighter mirror of greater width -
clearing a technological barrier that had limited astronomy for half a
century.
It is not the VLT's size that is the envy of US astronomers, but its
revolutionary image-focusing capability, called 'adaptive optics'. In this
state-of-the-art technology, 200 electronic arms gently push and pull the
telescope's mirror to eliminate the 'twinkling' of stars caused by
atmospheric turbulence. By bringing the fuzzy images into focus, the picture
quality is almost as sharp as if taken from space.
The first telescope to use 'adaptive optics' was inaugurated at La Silla in
1989. It is now capturing images that are several times sharper than those
obtained by telescopes of conventional design. 'From an optical point of
view, we have built the best telescope in the world today,' says Daniel
Hofstadt, La Silla's technical manager.
Hofstadt, however, does not see the VLT project or adaptive optics replacing
the need for telescopes in space. Terrestrial observatories, he explains,
cannot detect faint stars that emit ultraviolet light because this is
blotted out by the Earth's protective ozone layer. 'The VLT and the Hubble
will complement each other,' he says.

<TEXT>
   Astronomers may have to change their ideas about
the early universe because of the discovery of the oldest and most
distant galaxy ever observed, researchers said.
   The galaxy, about 10 times the size of the Milky Way, was formed
before the universe was a mere 2 billion years old, said its
discoverer, Simon Lilly of the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
   Researchers have previously found indirect evidence of galaxies
forming at extreme distances, but this is the first clear
observation of a mature galaxy at those distances, Lilly said
Monday in a telephone interview.
   ``This pushes back the time at which galaxies formed in the
early universe,'' he said.
   The discovery could force a revision in astronomers' conception
of the universe, Lilly said.
   ``If we find more objects like this, the cold-dark-matter
scenario will be in trouble,'' he said.
   That scenario says that most of the universe exists in the form
of cold, dark material that we cannot observe. It also predicts
that massive galaxies like the one discovered should not exist so
early in the history of the universe, Lilly said.
   In January, Richard Elston and George and Marcia Rieke of the
University of Arizona reported the possible existence of even
older, more distant galaxies, but those results are not yet
confirmed, George Rieke said Monday.
   ``I would say he has claim to the most distant galaxy,'' Rieke
said. ``We have claim to having found candidates that may be even
more distant, but that's different from having it nailed down.''
   Nevertheless, Rieke said, the two lines of research mesh nicely,
because ``the existence of his galaxy implies that something like
the galaxies that we have candidates for must exist.''
   Harding Smith, a physicist at the University of California, San
Diego, who has studied distant galaxies, said Lilly ``has made a
substantial jump, and I do think it's an important result.''
   It will help astronomers understand the processes that form
galaxies, Smith said. ``We don't understand when they form and how
they form, and both of these are very interesting questions because
they may tell us more about what happened even earliier in the
universe,'' Smith said.
   A report of Lilly's work has been accepted for publication in
the Astrophysical Journal, he said.
   To determine an object's distance and age, astronomers observe
the so-called redshift of light emitted by the object. The higher
the redshift, the older and more distant the object.
   Lilly's galaxy has a redshift of 3.4, he said. The oldest and
most distant galaxy observed before his had a redshift of 1.8, he
said.
   The Arizona researchers are searching for evidence of new
galaxies at redshifts of 6 to 25, Rieke said.
   The age of the universe cannot be precisely determined, Lilly
said, but the best estimates put it at between 10 billion and 20
billion years.
   If a figure of 15 billion years is arbitrarily chosen as a
starting point, then the redshift of Lilly's galaxy means the light
that Lilly observed left the galaxy when the universe was about 3
billion years old.
   Observations of the galaxy itself indicate it was then 1 billion
or 2 billion years old, he said, meaning it was formed when the
universe was 1 billion to 2 billion years old.
   Lilly said his research involved identifying the source of a
distant emission of radio waves that was recorded in 1981.
   He used the Canada-France-Hawaii optical telescope and the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope _ both located atop Hawaii's
Mauna Kea volcano _ to pick up light and infrared radiation from
the precise point where the radio emission had been detected. Those
observations allowed him to identify it as a mature galaxy.

including a project dear to NASA/Ames Research Center in Mountain View: an
airborne telescope, mounted on a Boeing 747, that would explore barely visible
galaxies and seek data to explain how stars form.;    Once every 10 years, the
National Research Council surveys astronomers and culls their ideas to find
the best, most efficient science. From hundreds of suggestions, 15 made the
cut this time. Half to two-thirds are expected to get federal funding for the
next decade, and the rest will get strong consideration from Congress.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Key congressional leaders, such as the chairman of the House Science, Space
and Technology Committee, George Brown Jr., D-Riverside, heard the council's
recommendations.;    One of the strongest was a renewed effort to maintain and
upgrade existing observatories.;    "No prudent businessman would run a
business with such a small investment in infrastructure," said John Bahcall,
of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., who helped write the
report.;     THE PROPOSED list includes some expensive items, such as the $1.3
billion space infrared telescope facility, a cousin of the Hubble space
telescope planned by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. It also
includes $250 million for smaller, shoestring projects.;    "We felt that 'big
science' is very important," said Christopher McKee, an astrophysicist at the
University of California, Berkeley, who worked on the report. "And we want to
encourage 'small science.' We don't view it as an either/or situation.";   
The Ames project falls somewhere in between, in a category called "moderate
programs.";    The $230 million stratospheric observatory for far-infrared
astronomy, in the works since 1986, is a joint project of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and the German federal space agency.;   
NASA would develop and operate the plane, while the Germans have agreed to
finance and build the telescope.;    KNOWN AS SOFIA, the 747 would carry a
100-inch-diameter telescope. It would collect about 10 times more light than
the smaller, older model Ames now flies in a Lockheed C-141, which is called
the Kuiper airborne observatory.;    The Kuiper is the world's only flying
telescope. SOFIA would replace it. About $6 million has been spent already on
SOFIA, which is scheduled for funding in 1993 and takeoff in 1998.;    Flying
45,000 feet above Earth, several thousand feet higher than the average
passenger jet, SOFIA will focus on a key part of the electromagnetic spectrum
-- the infrared, which lies between shorter visible light and longer radio
waves.;    Water in the Earth's atmosphere absorbs much of the infrared
spectrum, making the waves undetectable to ground telescopes.;    The infrared
spectrum holds clues to cradles of stars called molecular clouds. Scientists
believe the cold, dark, gaseous clouds, which are mostly hydrogen, give birth
to stars. But they don't know exactly how.;    SOFIA will be able to look at
clouds both inside and outside the Milky Way galaxy.;    THE SCIENCE will be
great, said Ed Erickson, SOFIA's chief scientist. But he also raved about the
observatory's adaptability. After flights, researchers will be able to change
and improve the scientific gadgetry on board the plane. That is something
scientists can't do with the Hubble telescope, for instance, which is loaded
with outdated technology.;    "They can conceive of an instrument, build it
and fly it, in a few years or less," said Erickson, who flew in one of the
original flying telescopes, a Learjet first launched by Ames 25 years ago. He
believes that cutting-edge technology can be put into SOFIA for its entire
20-year lifespan.;    Erickson said SOFIA would complement the space infrared
telescope facility, which is planned to have a smaller, more sensitive
telescope. The space-based telescope would be able to answer more questions
about cosmology -- the origin of the universe.;    Another program the
research council deemed essential was the millimeter array, a $115 million set
of telescopes planned by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. It owes
some of its technology to a three-telescope array run by UC-Berkeley in a lava
bed between Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen.;    "It will be enormously
significant," said James R. Forster, an astronomer at the Berkeley post, who
predicted that the millimeter array would be used to study molecular clouds in
the radio spectrum. "Resolution will be improved, and we'll get finer images."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  An orbiting observatory has upset existing astronomical theory by detecting
violent bursts of gamma rays in space that could not have been produced by any
known object or phenomenon in the cosmos.;   Astrophysicists who announced the
finding Monday said the mysterious signals could be coming from "exotic small
objects" very near the solar system or from extremely powerful objects lurking
at the edges of the universe.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  VIOLENT GAMMA RAY BURSTS JETTISON SPACE THEORIES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Fleeting but powerful barrages of gamma rays have posed one of the most
enduring and unusual mysteries of modern astronomy since they were detected
more than two decades ago. But until the new discovery, scientists thought
they could explain their origin through known phenomena.;   The findings --
from NASA's massive Gamma Ray Observatory, launched into Earth orbit less than
six months ago -- indicate that the sources of the bright bursts could be very
close objects with relatively modest firepower, or that they could be
enormously distant cataclysms that release far more energy in one second than
the stellar explosions known as supernovae.;   Either way, their existence
shakes current theories on what's out there, according to elated National

explained by any existing theory or object, said NASA scientist Gerald
Fishman, leader of the team whose instrument made the discovery. The sources
"must be a new type of object previously unknown or undetectable" in other
wavelengths.;   News of the discovery was greeted by scientists outside the
Gamma Ray Observatory team as "astounding" and "mind-blowing." Theoretical
astrophysicists are expected to scramble to find some explanation for the
findings.;   Astrophysicists had grown comfortable with the theory that the
bursts -- 100,000 times as luminous as the sun but invisible to the eye
because of their wavelength -- originated in explosions or "star quakes" on
the surfaces of neutron stars within our own Milky Way galaxy. (Neutron stars
are ordinary stars that have collapsed, compressing matter with the mass of
the sun into an object about the size of a metropolitan area, giving off
gargantuan amounts of energy.);   But if that theory is true, as recent
observations using the Soviet spacecraft GRANAT seem to confirm, the Gamma Ray
Observatory's detector would have shown most of the bursts coming from the
center of the Milky Way galaxy's disk -- a flattened pinwheel of stars with
Earth and the solar system located toward the end of one of the arms. This
region is rich in neutron stars. So are other galaxies, but the neutron stars
are not numerous enough or distributed in a way that accounts for the gamma
ray bursts.;   The new evidence indicates the gamma ray bursts are not
emanating from the neutron stars at the galactic center but rather from all
directions.;   This means they have to be either very close, like a cloud of
unknown objects enclosing the solar system, or enormously distant, scientists
said. All the objects at intermediate distances, in galaxies or galactic
clusters, appear in clumps and chains rather than in a uniform distribution.; 
 Gamma ray theorist Paul Joss, a physics professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said the discovery will have a "very dramatic effect"
in the science community. "I am at a total loss to explain the findings.";  
The possibilities, he said, are that the gamma rays are coming from objects as
diverse as the theoretical "cosmic strings" on the edges of the universe to
invisible dead stars lurking "virtually in our back yard." Or the mystery may
turn out to be connected with another of astronomy's puzzles, he said. That
is, it may be linked to the vast amount of theoretical "dark matter" that so
far has been detected only in the gravitational force it exerts on visible
objects throughout the universe.;   Gamma rays, born deep inside atomic
nuclei, are difficult to study. They carry the hottest, highest energies of
any form of electromagnetic radiation and are thought to originate often in
the cataclysms that erupt around some of the most bizarre objects known,
including quasars, pulsars and black holes. But at close range these objects
are not distributed evenly in all directions from Earth. And from the edge of
the universe -- where they might be evenly distributed -- none can produce the
energy levels that reach Earth.;   The 17-ton, $560 million Gamma Ray
Observatory is by far the most sensitive and advanced gamma ray hunter ever
dispatched.;   The bursts of gamma rays that it has detected last from a
fraction of a second to hundreds of seconds.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Fleeting but powerful barrages of gamma rays have posed one of the most
enduring and unusual mysteries of modern astronomy since they were detected
more than two decades ago. But until the new discovery, scientists thought
they could explain their origin through known phenomena.;   The findings --
from NASA's massive Gamma Ray Observatory, launched into Earth orbit less than
six months ago -- indicate that the sources of the bright bursts could be very
close objects with relatively modest firepower, or that they could be
enormously distant cataclysms that release far more energy in one second than
the stellar explosions known as supernovas.;   Either way, their existence
shakes current theories on what's out there, according to elated National

   One of the nation's oldest astronomical
treasures, the mothballed 100-inch telescope at the Mount Wilson
Observatory in California, will be recommissioned under a new
ownership plan for the facility, the Carnegie Institution announced
Thursday.
   The institution, which built the observatory in 1904 and has
operated it since, retired the big Hooker telescope in 1985 as it
shifted its priorities to development of more powerful instruments
at its new observatory in Las Campanas, Chile.
   For three decades, the Hooker telescope, completed in 1917, was
the world's largest, and the prototype for all modern-day reflecting
telescopes. Its 100-inch mirror, weighing 4{ tons, was cast by a
French bottle-making company.
   Despite mothballing the Hooker, the Carnegie Institution has
continued to operate three other research telescopes at Mount
Wilson. Under the plan announced Thursday, the entire observatory
will be transferred to the new Mount Wilson Institution, headed by
Carnegie veterans, over the next two years and will be independently
financed, largely from government grants.
   The arrangement was worked out primarily by George Preston,
former observatory director and now a chief scientist there. Preston
called the plan ``a rebirth for the observatory, and one that will
make the best use of the facilities.''
   Not only will the Hooker telescope be recommissioned within a
year, he said, but it will be fitted with high-tech computer
controls and instruments over two to three years. He said also that
overall research at the observatory will be expanded under plans to
double the operating budget, to $750,000, and to add several more
scientists to the five teams already at work there.
   During the 1920s, Carnegie astronomers Edwin Hubble and Milton
Humason, using the Hooker telescope, established that the ``spiral
nebulae'' in the night sky were other galaxies, made up of billions
of stars and located far outside the Milky Way, the galaxy that
contains the Earth. Thus, the size of the universe then known by
astronomers expanded almost a thousand-fold overnight.
   But growing light pollution from nearby Los Angeles has in recent
years virtually destroyed Hooker's biggest claim to fame _ that
ability to study faint, distant galaxies _ and was a major factor in
Carnegie's decision to focus its efforts in Chile.
   However, Preston and Arthur Vaughn said the Hooker telescope, at
5,700 feet altitude, remains an ideal tool for studying the sun and
for detecting planets around stars in the Milky Way. It also will be
used to study ``starspots,'' similar to the sunspot activity once
thought to be unique to the sun.

   The shuttle that put the Hubble Space
Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s
by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the
world's most powerful telescope.
   ``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical
significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin
Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' astronaut Kathy
Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle
Discovery.
   The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker
Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan. After she brings the
eyepiece back to Earth, it will be placed on display at the
observatory.
   ``It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy
to the future of astronomy,'' said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the
Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group runs the
observatory, located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los
Angeles.
   ``The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at
Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of
the universe,'' McAfee said. ``We believe the Hubble Space
Telescope will do the same thing.''
   The Hooker Telescope was the world's most powerful telescope
from its construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale
Telescope was placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory
northeast of San Diego.
   Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine
the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said
in a statement.
   ``This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that
other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local
galaxy,'' the institute said.
   During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant used the
Hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint
galaxies, showing that most of them were moving away from each
other very quickly.
   ``This provided observational evidence for the concept,
suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is
expanding,'' the institute said.
   Hubble's work helped convince scientists the universe was
created in a giant explosion, called the ``big bang,'' an estimated
15 billion years ago.
   The Hooker Telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie
Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving
move. The institute hopes to obtain funds to reopen it.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Crunch for Big Bang: Clive Cookson explains why cosmologists
are stunned into silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hubble Space Telescope - previously derided as a Dollars 2.5bn white
elephant in orbit - is redeeming its reputation in spectacular fashion. The
images sent back this year, after astronauts repaired the telescope's
defective mirror, show a myriad of astronomical objects too distant to be
seen with the most powerful Earth-bound observatories.
Hubble's latest observations have thrown cosmologists into a spin, because
they appear to contradict the leading theory for the origin and development
of the universe. Most troubling is their implication that the universe is
only 8bn years old, when many astronomers are confident from other evidence
that the oldest stars have been shining for about 15bn years.
Of course the universe cannot be younger than the stars in it. So, if
further observations confirm these findings, cosmologists will have to
change their views of the universe's birth in a cosmic fireball - the Big
Bang - and its subsequent expansion.
The basic idea of the Big Bang - that everything has grown from an
infinitely small point containing an unimaginably large amount of energy -
is not under serious threat.
But other popular concepts of contemporary cosmology may not survive. One is
the 'flat universe' containing just enough matter for gravity eventually to
stop it expanding but too little to pull everything back together again in a
Big Crunch. The latest Hubble observations are likely to revive support for
the less dense 'open universe' model, in which things will fly apart rapidly
for ever.
They may even tempt scientists to reconsider the idea, originally put
forward by Albert Einstein, of a 'cosmological constant'. This is a fudge
factor, hated and rejected by most cosmologists because they cannot give it
any theoretical foundation, which would counteract the force of gravity and
push the universe apart more rapidly with time.
The Hubble observations are the first phase of an international programme to
assess the scale, size and age of the universe with the space telescope. The
research team found 20 individual stars of a type called Cepheid variables
in the distant M100 galaxy. Astronomers use such stars as 'standard candles'
for measuring interstellar distances, because they pulsate with a frequency
that depends directly on their intrinsic brightness.
By comparing this absolute brightness with the star's apparent brightness
when seen from Earth, the astronomers can estimate its distance - 56m
light-years in the case of the M100 galaxy. They combine this figure with
the star's 'red shift', which shows how fast it is moving away from us, to
calculate Hubble's Constant, the rate at which the universe is expanding.
Finally, to estimate the universe's age, they must adjust the rate for any
deceleration or acceleration since its formation.
The age of 8bn years is derived from the observations by standard
cosmological theory. It can be pushed back by another 3bn years by giving
the universe a very low density (though this might contradict other
astronomical observations). But an age of 15bn years to match the oldest
stars would require an accelerating force - Einstein's dreaded cosmological
constant.
Scientists have reacted very cautiously to the findings, published at the
end of October in the journal Nature - so cautiously that Nature attacked
their silence in an editorial a month later. 'Cosmologists had better say
something,' the journal said.
However, cosmologists themselves say they are waiting for more Hubble
observations, using 'standard candles' in other distant galaxies, to confirm
the first results and reduce their margin of error.
'Within a year or two, we ought to have a more definite measurement,' says
Sir Martin Rees of Cambridge University, Britain's new Astronomer-Royal. 'If
it turns out that there is still a big discrepancy with the age of the
oldest stars, then cosmologists will have problems maintaining their
standard theory of the universe.'
The universe's age is the most controversial issue addressed so far with the
Hubble telescope. But the bus-sized instrument has taken many more
spectacular pictures through its new corrective lenses.
Some of the best shots, released this month by the US space agency Nasa,
show parts of the universe billions of light years away - and therefore
billions of years in the past. They reveal for the first time the shape of
galaxies emerging in the young universe.
'There is a menagerie of strange objects that have no counterpart in today's
universe,' said Mark Dickinson of the Space Telescope Science Institute in
Baltimore. Most of the stars are arranged in disorganised groups that look
like torn fragments of present-day spiral galaxies but may in fact be their
precursors. Confusingly, mature elliptical galaxies also seem to have
existed within 2bn years of the Big Bang, very similar to today's.
Although it is far too soon for cosmologists to have made sense of the
primeval galactic menagerie, this new evidence suggests that galaxies
started to form very early in the life of the universe. If so, it will lend
more support to the idea of a low-density open universe with a less even
distribution of matter than the popular 'flat universe' model.
Yet another fragment of Hubble evidence in favour of a an ever expanding
universe came in November, when astronomers published the results of a
search for small dim stars, too faint to be seen from Earth, which they
thought might make up some of the universe's 'missing mass'. They found far
fewer than expected.
Unless a space gremlin strikes, Hubble will provide another stunning set of
observations during 1995. The age of the universe should be clearer a year
from now, but the telescope will probably have thrown up another conundrum
by then to silence the cosmologists.

'At this instant, through this very document, are perhaps passing radio
waves bearing the conversations of distant creatures - conversations we
could record if we but pointed a telescope in the right direction and tuned
to the proper frequency . . .'
 - Astronomy Survey Committee of the US National Academy of Sciences, 1972.
SUPPOSE YOU are staying in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, and you want to get
to Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. It is simple. You drive
south, then east, then south and then east again on to the Santa Monica
freeway.
As it is the rush hour, the traffic buzzes angrily. You peek at other
drivers. Boy, have they got problems; they're probably in therapy. But you,
you're doing fine, because you have now sort of drifted across five lanes of
traffic and have somehow turned north on to the Pasadena freeway.
As you wheel along, you fiddle with the radio 'Seek' button, flicking from
station to station, hundreds of them, seemingly, pumping out pop, rock, rap;
bulletins and news flashes; rapes and serial killings; messages from our
sponsor; dog food and vitamin pills; Tums, Skippy, Tylenol - uproar,
babeldom.
As it happens, radio and TV signals broadcast on Earth are also transmitted
into space at the speed of light. The earliest TV transmissions from Earth
have travelled more than 40 light years, or ten times further than Alpha
Centauri, our own sun's nearest neighbour. This radio, radar and TV leakage
of ours now fills a sphere more than 80 light years in diameter. (A light
year is the distance light travels in one year: about 6 trillion miles).
In addition, we have sent into space a few intentional messages, such as
that broadcast in 1974 at the rededication of the Arecibo Observatory in
Puerto Rico. The message included descriptions of our solar system, the
elements important to Earthly life and the structure of the DNA molecule. We
beamed that message in the direction of the globular star cluster M13, about
25,000 light years away.
Which is all fine and good. But what about incoming messages? Are we ready
to receive, as well as transmit? After all, our own Milky Way galaxy
contains an estimated 300bn-400bn stars. And with each passing year,
estimates of the probability of intelligent life on far-flung planets
increase. In the view of many scientists on Earth, we are within reach of
one of the key steps in our evolution - knowledge of the existence, nature
and activities of independent civilisations in space.
Are we ready for incoming calls? The answer is Yes: we are about to start
serious eavesdropping. On October 12, Columbus Day, Nasa will launch its
ten-year, Dollars 100m (Pounds 57.8m) Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence, or Seti programme - a systematic search of the microwave radio
spectrum for signals of intelligent origin. Seti is a joint venture between
Nasa's Ames Research Centre and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the
California Institute of Technology.
As such, it is part of one of the seven areas of Nasa research recommended
by the National Commission on Space in 1986: 'A continuing programme to
search for evidence that life exists - or has existed  - beyond Earth, by
studying other bodies of the solar system, by searching for planets circling
other stars, and by searching for signals broadcast by intelligent life
elsewhere in the galaxy.'
Naturally, the launch of Nasa's Seti programme will prove a lodestar for
jesters, cynics and two-bit comedians, the banality of whose jokes - 'I was
on my way to Venus when all of a sudden . . .' - will be as predictable as
the Flat Earth witticisms that reverberated in Columbus's ears when he set
sail for America 500 years ago.
BIOASTRONOMY - the study of life in the universe, and the search for
evidence of intelligence - is now so respectable that it is almost
strait-laced. A few generations ago, astronomers believed that planetary
systems were extremely rare; that the Earth's ability to support life was
possibly unique.
In the last two decades, however, advances in astronomy and physics have
supported the idea that planets are not rare but a natural part of the
star-formation process, and may number in the hundreds of billions in our
galaxy alone. As a result, in 1990 the US Congress voted funds for Nasa to
design and build special digital processing systems capable of searching
tens of millions of radio channels.
Is anyone out there? In the editors' foreword to the account of proceedings
at the Third International Symposium on Bioastronomy in Savoie, France, in
June 1990, the complex trail of cosmic evolution is described in five
stages:
First, the appearance of matter soon after Big Bang, leading to the
formation of stars and planets several billion years later and continuing
with the synthesis of chemical elements like carbon;
Second, formation of the first organic molecules; these molecules have been
discovered in interstellar space by radio-astronomers and in comets by space
probes;
Third, a prebiotic chemistry stage in which complex building blocks are
produced, such as nitric bases that form the rungs of the DNA double helix
ladder; some theories predict that a prebiotic chemistry could be proceeding
even now on Titan, the large moon of the planet Saturn;
Fourth, a primitive biological stage like the one of bacteria which
dominated the Earth's first few billion years; scientists hope to discover
this form of biological activity, perhaps in a different form, buried in the
permafrost of Mars;
Fifth, 'advanced' life, perhaps more advanced than ours. Nothing - so far -
indicates that Homo sapiens are unique in the universe.
To quote Nasa: 'One direct way of testing whether intelligent life exists
beyond our solar system is to search for an artificially generated radio
signal coming from interstellar space. Advanced civilisations might be
operating radio beacons, possibly to attract the attention of emerging
societies and bring them into contact with a community of long-established
intelligent societies existing throughout the galaxy.'
To detect either type of signal - beacon or leakage  - it makes great sense
to look at frequencies where background radio noise is minimal. 'One of the
quietest regions of the electromagnetic spectrum', says Nasa, 'is the
'microwave window' that lies in the frequency band between 1,000 and 10,000
megahertz (MHz). It is reasonable to assume that others wishing to establish
interstellar contact by radio might choose this band.'
SO OFF WE GO, though not for the first time. The first serious proposal for
using radio waves to transmit information over interstellar distances was
suggested by physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi in Nature in
1959. Since then, more than 50 searches have been conducted by dozens of
astronomers in at least eight countries. These were primitive efforts, using
equipment designed for other purposes and limited in duration, sensitivity,
number of channels, types of signals and numbers of stars observed. In spite
of these limitations, most of those searches found unexplained signals.
What is new about the Seti programme starting on October 12, says Nasa, is
the technology now available. Existing radio telescopes on Earth are
sensitive enough to detect, at distances of 1,000 light years or more,
signals no more powerful than some now leaving Earth. In addition, advances
in data processing make it possible to sift automatically through millions
of frequency channels each second and, if present, identify signals
transmitted by intelligent societies.
The Seti plan involves two complementary modes. First, there will be an
all-sky search covering nearly 500m channels in the 1,000-10,000 MHz range,
plus spot bands up to 25,000 MHz, using the 34-metre antennas of Nasa's Deep
Space Network. This sky search will cover at least 10,000 times more
frequency space than all previous survey attempts and will be about 300
times more sensitive.
Second, a special targeted search using the largest available radio
telescopes (including Arecibo) will examine nearly 800 sun-like stars within
100 light years of Earth. Some stellar clusters and nearby galaxies will
also be observed. This targeted search will examine 2bn channels over a
frequency range of 1,000-3,000 MHz, plus higher spot bands.
Would we recognise an intelligent signal? Quite easily, apparently.
Would Nasa tell us if it did detect a signal? You will not catch Nasa out
like that. 'Once a signal is confirmed as being of ETI origin, an
announcement of the discovery would be made as quickly and as widely as
possible', it claims. 'One way in which the announcement could be made is
described in a Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the
Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence.'
Would we know what the signal meant? Apparently we would. If intentional,
the signal will be anticryptographic - easy to decode. A civilisation bent
on sending messages would probably employ simple tutorial pictures and use
an interstellar Esperanto based on universal physical and mathematical
principles. Conversely, a civilisation's own domestic output - Neighbours of
M13, News At Sixty  - may be difficult to decipher.
Would senders know their messages had been received? No, not unless we
replied. Nasa itself has no plan for replying. As part of the International
Seti Post-Detection Protocol now under consideration, it would be up to the
nations of Earth whether, and how, to reply.
How much will the Seti project cost? The cost for a ten-year period is
described as averaging Dollars 10m a year, or less than 0.1 per cent of
Nasa's budget - 'less', it claims winsomely, 'than a nickel per American per
year.'
Against a background of ballooning US federal budget deficits and the
spectre of US poverty, Nasa has become as skilled as any institution in
fighting its corner and defending its plans.
Even if no signal from space is detected, it says the technology developed
to search for faint signals from distant planets can be applied to more
down-to-Earth problems in medical diagnostic imaging, resource exploration,
aircraft safety and electronics. It will also yield uniquely detailed
astronomical data and have useful spin-offs in education. But if a signal
was detected, why then: 'Information gathered from other civilisations may
provide important practical as well as social and philosophical benefits.'
HOWEVER MANY times Nasa says that Seti has nothing to do with UFO detection
or little green men, it knows it cannot stanch the jokes among the
unsophisticated. In Washington, one politician railed against Seti's 1990-91
budget like this: 'Of course there are flying saucers and advanced
civilisations in outer space. But we don't need to spend Dollars 6m to find
evidence of these rascally creatures. We only need 75 cents to buy a tabloid
at the local supermarket.'
When I finally reached the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, north of Pasadena, I
was asked at the reception desk for photographic ID, plus my 'resident
alien's card.' I explained that I was not a resident alien, merely an alien.
A little later, I described this exchange to Dr Michael J Klein, Seti's
project manager at the JPL, who laughed quite cheerfully, just as Columbus
must have laughed till his face ached while supervising the provisioning of
his ships. Klein's equivalent of provisioning is moving equipment into
California's Mojave desert and supervising numerous other tasks while trying
to ward off budget cuts.
'We are not talking about little green men or space travel', he told me.
'This is not scientific fantasy. Seti is a search. We are not transmitting.
Somebody else will do that. For us, going to the stars is not a 20th century
possibility. It may not be a 28th century possibility, but at least we now
have the means to listen for sounds of other technologies. It's a bit like
cutting an acre of grass. To date, we've used nail-clippers; now we've got a
lawnmower.
'Attitudes among scientists differ. People disagree on the chances of
success, but everybody agrees that it should be done: there is good science
coming out of it.'
For the record, Klein is a church-goer. 'Do I believe in a supreme God? Yes,
I do. I don't have a lot of answers, but I have a lot of awe and faith. I
believe in a Creator who established the laws of physics.'
And - for the record  - yes, Klein does expect that one day Earth will
detect an intelligent signal from somewhere in the Milky Way. 'My guess is
that such a signal will be detected at a distance much greater than ten
light years. I would guess 100 or more. Most of us who work on Seti believe
that some day there will be contact via communication - not space travel.
There won't be dialogue because of the time lags involved, though there may
one day be dialogue between generations. We hope we are the ones who
succeed. At least we are starting things off. It will not prove futile.'

FT  29 DEC 92 / Mystery of missing mass: This year's models of the universe

As a momentous year for astronomical observations draws to a close,
scientists remain in a ferment of uncertainty about the origins, structure
and future of the universe.
The first pictures of the emerging universe transmitted by the US Cosmic
Background Explorer (Cobe) satellite, together with observations from the
Hubble Space Telescope, have inspired new cosmological theories without
dismissing the old front-runners.
The only clear landmark is still the Big Bang itself. Mainstream astronomers
have accepted for several years that we live in the expanding debris of a
cosmic fireball that created everything 12bn to 18bn years ago. But there is
no consensus on the way the universe has grown, its composition today, and
whether it will expand forever into an infinite coldness or come back
together in a Big Crunch.
The Cobe pictures show gigantic 'ripples' of microwave radiation which
emerged from the universe when it was 300,000 years old - 0.002 per cent of
its present age. These faint echoes of the Big Bang are the earliest
detectable signs of the unevenness which gravity later pulled into clusters
of galaxies and stars. It may never be possible directly to see any further
back in time; when the universe was less than 300,000 years old, it was too
dense to allow any radiation to escape.
Cosmologists are using the Cobe patterns both to extrapolate further into
the past - to within a fraction of a second of the Big Bang - and to look
forward to the present universe and its fate.
They are particularly keen to solve the mystery of the missing mass. All the
visible objects observed by astronomers - galaxies, stars, dust clouds and
so on - contain less matter than they know must actually exist. They
calculate that the mass of 'dark matter' is 10 to 100 times greater than the
visible matter, in order to provide enough gravity to account for the
movements of the stars and explain the development of the universe from the
primeval ripples observed by Cobe to what we see today.
Theories to explain the missing mass include:
It is ordinary matter composed of the particles that make up the sun and
earth - protons, neutrons and electrons - but is not visible by any
astronomical instrument. For example, galaxies may be surrounded by a myriad
of planet-sized bodies, known whimsically as Massive Compact Halo Objects;
'machos' would be too small to kindle the nuclear fires that produce light
from visible stars.
It is 'cold dark matter' consisting of slow-moving subatomic particles left
over from the Big Bang. These Weakly Interacting Massive Particles may
pervade the whole universe. Theoreticians calculate that about 1,000,000bn
'wimps' pass through each one of us every second. But they make little
impression on ordinary matter and have therefore not been detected.
It is 'hot dark matter' consisting of subatomic particles, each with a tiny
mass but moving almost as fast as light. Neutrinos are the most likely
candidate for hot dark matter, if it exists.
Charles Alcock, an astrophysicist at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in
California, believes that, before invoking exotic particles to explain the
missing mass, it is worth searching more thoroughly for ordinary matter that
has remained hidden. A US-Australian project is beginning to track millions
of stars every night and look for the tiny changes in brightness that should
occur as they pass behind planet-sized objects.
However, most cosmological theories put a limit on the amount of ordinary
matter that could have been created in the immediate aftermath of the Big
Bang. If they are correct, the universe must be still dominated by exotic
particles. Earlier this year, cold dark matter was the leading main
contender but the latest thinking is that a mixture of hot and cold matter
fits the Cobe observations most closely.
The 'inflationary' model of the universe, presently in vogue, postulates a
super-expansionary burst immediately after the Big Bang. The effect would
have been analogous to an explosion triggering an atomic bomb, releasing an
unimaginable amount of energy on a scale of less than a millionth of a
millimetre. Random fluctuations during this inflationary period sowed the
seeds of our universe.
Perhaps the most important prediction of inflationary cosmology is that we
are balanced between a 'closed' universe containing enough matter eventually
to reverse the expansion and an 'open' universe flying apart for ever.
Growth will stop after an infinite period but there will be no Big Crunch.
This idea, which appeals to astronomers' aesthetic sense, is supported but
not proved by Cobe.
On a more speculative level, some inflation theorists suggest that ours may
be one of an infinite number of universes. Each would have different laws of
physics because these would have been determined by random fluctuations in a
single primeval force, immediately after its Big Bang. The one we live in
happens to be conducive to the differentiation of matter into stars, planets
 -and life.
Astronomers are now waiting for other observations of the emerging universe
to confirm and supplement Cobe's. 'Everyone who works in this field believes
the Cobe results but we will feel more comfortable when an independent
experiment detects fluctuations in the microwave background,' says Peter
Coles, an astronomer at Queen Mary and Westfield College, London.
Several ground-based instruments are searching and Professor Martin Rees,
director of Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy, expects positive
results to be announced by June. They should help to sort out competing
theories by distinguishing variations on a finer angular resolution than
Cobe is able to produce.
At the same time the Dollars 2bn Hubble telescope, in orbit around the
earth, is proving to be more useful than the pessimists predicted when a
flaw was discovered in the main mirror after its launch in 1990. 'You can
get out something approaching the telescope's original design specification,
but at the price of spending longer pointing it at the object you want to
look at,' says Ian Smail, an astrophysicist at Durham University.
He is part of a group using Hubble to explore 'gravitational lenses' -
clusters of galaxies billions of light years away whose gravitational pull
acts as a natural magnifying glass, bending and refocusing the light from
even more distant galaxies. Studies of gravitational lenses will reveal more
information about the way dark matter is distributed through the universe.
Recently, Hubble has also given a more precise estimate of the age of the
universe, based on its rate of expansion. And it has sent back pictures of
the most distant-known galaxy, forming 1bn to 2bn years after the Big Bang
around a massive black hole.
Astronomers expect another crop of new observations from space and earth
next year. By Christmas 1993 scientists will not be able to predict
confidently the ultimate fate of the universe but they should have a better
idea of whether it is filled with machos, wimps or hot neutrinos.

   U.S. and Canadian astronomers have found 10
planet-like objects orbiting distant stars, a discovery that
intensifies speculation about the existence of life beyond the
Earth.
   In reports Wednesday at the International Astronomical Union
assembly, astronomers from the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., said they have found ``what might
be a very large planet'' orbiting a star 90 light years away.
   In an independent study, an astronomer from the University of
Victoria, British Columbia, said he has found evidence of planets
orbiting nine stars, and suggested that as many as half of the
stars in the Milky Way galaxy may have ``planetary companions.''
   Bruce Campbell, chief of the Canadian team, said his result
``showing that the majority of stars in the galaxy perhaps have
planetary systems could be interpreted as a sign that there are
also Earth-like planets suitable for life, but we have no evidence
of that at all.''
   ``It makes it easier to speculate than it was a few years ago
when there were zero planetary candidates,'' said David W. Latham,
leader of the Smithsonian team. ``We can start to speculate now
about how often life evolved.''
   Both teams of astronomers made the discoveries by analyzing the
color shift of light collected from stars. Light from a distant
source changes color slightly if the light source is moving. It
shifts toward red if it is moving away, and toward blue if moving
toward the observer.
   By carefully measuring this shift, the astronomers are able to
detect wobble, or movement of the stars. This movement can be
caused only by the gravitational effect of a nearby body, and the
velocity of the movement allows the scientists to calculate the
size of the object.
   Latham said the planet-like object he found is about 20 times
the size of Jupiter, and is orbiting so close to star HD 114762
that it would be``much hotter than an oven.''
   ``It's not a place you would go to to look for life,'' he said.
   The object, said Latham, is about 3,000 times the size of Earth
and is on the very edge of what is commonly thought to be the
maximum size for a planet.
   Star HD 114762 is 90 light years _ about 522 trillion miles _
from Earth.
   Campbell said he and his Canadian group used a technique even
more sensitive than the instruments used by Latham and were able to
find nine planetary objects after studying just 18 stars.
   The clearest data, he said, shows that a large planet orbits a
star called Tau Ceti.
   ``We see in the star the effects of a companion sized on the
order of Jupiter,'' said Campbell.
   Eight other planet-like objects were found about other stars, he
said, but the team was unable to make a precise measure of their
size.
   ``We can only infer masses on the order of 1 to 10 times that of
Jupiter,'' said Campbell.
   All of the stars studied by the Canadian team are bright, about
magnitude 4. They all are similar in size to the sun, and all are
within 100 light years, about 580 trillion miles, from Earth.
   Latham's study, using the Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard,
Mass., concentrated on very faint stars and HD 114762 is of a 7
magnitude, too faint for sighting by the naked eye. Stars grow
fainter as the number increases on the magnitude scale. A magnitude
of 6 is the faintest visible to the naked eye.
   None of the discovered planets could actually be seen by the
astronomers because they are blotted out by the brightness of the
stars.
   ``Seeing these objects would be like placing a speck of dust
beside a 1,000-watt bulb and trying to see it from miles away,''
said Latham.
   Campbell said the instruments now used are not sensitive enough
to detect a planet as small as the Earth.
   Latham said the object near star HD 114762 has an orbital period
of 83.84 days and the Smithsonian team collected data on 30 cycles
over a seven-year period. The results have been confirmed by
independent observations of a Swiss astronomer.
   ``There have been a lot of claims about finding planets, but
this is the first with a strong technical support because we have
observed it over such a period of time,'' Latham said.
   Such objects could not be seen until the development in recent
years of instruments able to substantially amplify and measure the
light from stars.
   Now, with this new data, said astronomer Tsevi Mazeh of the
University of Tel Aviv, a new era is beginning.
   ``It makes it more plausible to assume now that there could be
Earth-like planets with life out there,'' he said.

<TEXT>     "The thing that makes it so interesting is it's varying in time in a rather
unusual way," said Marcus Price, professor of physics and astronomy at the
University of New Mexico.;    "In astronomy, we expect to have things vary
slowly, with the exception of pulsars. This has been especially true in radio
sources. We have not found them to vary a great deal in short times. This
source seems to vary sharply on a rather short scale," he said.;    The
mystery source has not been detected either optically or in infrared
wavelengths because it is obscured by galactic dust clouds.;    Astronomers
have ruled out possibilities of a supernova -- an exploding star -- or
recurring nova, which is re-energized by matter pulled in from a companion
star.;    The source's radio emission appears to be caused by electrons moving
in a strong magnetic field, VLA scientists said.;    Yervant Terzian, chairman
of Cornell University's astronomy department, said he had not yet heard of the
discovery but said, "Some of the most mysterious places in the universe are
the centers of galaxies.";    The enigmatic source was first noticed March 11
by Jun-Hui Zhao, an astronomer from Beijing conducting postdoctoral studies at
the VLA.  </TEXT>

finding places the clusters at a point only a few billion years later than the
"big bang" that many theorists say started the universe.;    Rosat scientist
Gunther Hasinger of the Max Planck Institute in Germany said the satellite
detected "what may be the first glimpse of the structure of the universe" at
such an early point.;    He said the satellite detected X-rays streaming from
quasars at the center of great galaxy groupings.;    "The quasars may not be
distributed randomly, but are in structures," Hasinger said. "The mere
existence of such structures (at this distance) is not compatible to some
theories.";    Discovery of the quasar groups adds to earlier findings of
immense clusters of galaxies, each with billions of stars, including one
structure called the "great wall" that extends about 500 million light years
across.;    Additionally, the journal Nature reported last week that the
Infrared Astronomy Satellite has found superclusters on a very large scale.;  
 Scientists attending the astronomical society meeting said the discovery of
structures doesn't destroy the big-bang theory, but it creates great
difficulties for sub-theories that have developed to support the big bang.;   
First published in 1927, the big-bang theory posits that the universe began
when a superdense conglomerate exploded some 10 to 20 billion years ago. Since
that instant, all matter has been expanding in all directions, like shrapnel
from an exploded bomb.;    Although many observations have supported the basic
big-bang theory, science has yet to reach a consensus on how matter expanding
from the bang was able to clump together and form stars, galaxies, clusters
and vast groupings such as the great wall.;    To explain the stellar
formations, scientists developed what is called the cold, dark matter theory.
This holds that 90 percent or more of the universe is dark matter that can't
be seen, but which is believed to exist because of its dynamic effects on
galaxies.;    The dark matter, the theory holds, would provide the
gravitational energy that would cause stellar bodies to form.;    Scientists
at the meeting agreed that the cold, dark matter theory "is in trouble" but
say it may be revised and yet endure.  </TEXT>

An ambitious effort to map the universe 100 times more thoroughly than ever 
before will be announced today by astronomers from a consortium of 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
The project will use a new telescope to be built atop Apache Peak in New 
Mexico. The goal of the 10-year venture is to produce a three-dimensional map 
of 1 million galaxies and other celestial targets that will give scientists 
their best opportunity yet to understand the large-scale structure of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
A traditional image of the sky is two dimensional: a flat portrait that does 
not reveal the depth and positioning of stars, which is essential to 
understanding how some galaxies form giant structures. In recent years, for 
example, scientists have discovered collections of stars and galaxies that form 
a wall millions of light years long. Other astronomers have discovered that the 
universe appears to be made up of giant bubbles with stars and galaxies 
surrounding great voids. 
</P>
<P>
Since the universe presumably began with the Big Bang, which should have 
distributed matter uniformly throughout space, scientists are struggling to 
explain why matter eventually evolved into the great structures now being 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The new survey also will include 100,000 quasars, mysterious objects about the 
size of the solar system but that shine more brightly than entire galaxies, and 
numerous gas clouds that could be either the remnants of exploding stars or 
future stars in the process of forming. The result should be a portrait of the 
universe that reveals the interrelationship and true form of various great 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, expected to cost $14 million, "is the cosmic equivalent of a U.S. 
Geological Survey map," said Richard Kron, professor of astronomy and 
astrophysics at the University of Chicago and director of the Yerkes 
Observatory in Wisconsin. "It will show details of galaxy and quasar 
distribution as well as the large scale 'geography' of the universe." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has ever made such an elegant and detailed map of the sky," said Bruce 
Margon, chairman of astronomy at the University of Washington and chairman of 
the Astrophysical Research Consortium, which is sponsoring the project. The 
survey will be conducted by scientists from the University of Chicago, the 
Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the consortium are New Mexico State University, Washington 
State University and the University of Washington. In addition, the Fermi 
National Accelerator Laboratory is expected to provide computers and programs 
that will make it possible for scientists to collect and analyze 10 million 
megabytes of information. 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the project is a new, wide-field, 2.5 meter telescope that 
will be operational by 1995. Most modern telescopes use light-sensitive 
computer chips called "charge-coupled devices" that count the photons of light 
hitting the mirror, thus greatly increasing their sensitivity. This new camera 
will have 30 such sensors and will be able to record 120 million points of 
light at one time.

<P>
The astronomers hope to complete the survey in about five to seven years after 
the project begins.

George Seielstad stood numbly as he looked at the wreckage of his 
"one-of-a-kind" radiotelescope set in a valley of the rugged Allegheny 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The radiotelescope, which is as long as a football field, had collapsed in on 
itself one cool November night in 1988, the result of metal fatigue after 26 
years of searching the heavens from a special "radio quiet zone" about 220 
miles west of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I was speechless and felt total disbelief. That telescope was one of a kind," 
said Seielstad, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
But the heap of twisted metal has given scientists a stellar opportunity. Plans 
are under way for a radiotelescope to tower 35 stories above and 330 feet 
around isolated Deer Creek Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the $75-million telescope should be ready to map the undiscovered 
universe by listening to the radio waves of outer space instead of peering into 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making something that will define the state-of-the-art radiotelescope 
technology to take us well into the next century," Seielstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers said the telescope's technical advancements will open more doors to 
understanding the evolution of the universe and composition of gases between 
galaxies. Scientists also can pursue more in-depth studies of pulsars, or 
small, quick-moving stars. 
</P>
<P>
The first telescope, completed in 1962 for $850,000, detected radio signals 
from far beyond the Milky Way and helped unlock the secrets to pulsars and 
quasars. 
</P>
<P>
The new telescope will be designed to receive more and clearer signals with a 
solid surface of about 2,000 individually controlled panels to counteract the 
sagging effects of gravity as the telescope moves. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope also will be fully movable, allowing it to point anywhere in the 
northern sky. The original telescope moved only up and down and relied on the 
Earth's rotation for further direction. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be 10 times more sensitive than anything else we have on Earth," said 
Ludwig Oster, program manager for the National Science Foundation, which is 
funding the project. "It will be on the cutting edge of technology and will do 
research that can't be done anywhere else. We can look further back in time 
toward the 'Big Bang.' " 
</P>
<P>
The telescope will be able to pick up naturally emitted radio signals from as 
far away as 10 billion light-years, giving scientists a glimpse into when 
galaxies first formed, astronomers said. 
</P>
<P>
The first search for intelligent life was at Green Bank and the new telescope 
may be included in some occasional extraterrestrial studies, Seielstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bank is in the world's only radio quiet zone, a 13,000-square-mile area 
designated by the federal government in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
Local radio and television stations can be picked up by the valley's 500 
residents, but signals are carefully regulated. Many residents have cable 
television. The mountains of the Monongahela National Forest also shield the 
instruments from radio "noise" caused by anything from car engines to toasters. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes this a unique spot on Earth and is the equivalent of a national park 
except we're protecting radio-frequency space," Seielstad said. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Lockman, an astronomer at the observatory's office in Charlottesville, Va., 
said the advanced telescope and radio quiet zone will make Green Bank a leading 
facility for astronomers from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The collapse left a major gap, but you have to take events like this and focus 
on the future and new opportunities," Seielstad said. "We couldn't have 
predicted it would have turned out this well."

<HEAD>Australia Unveils New Telescope To Search Southern Skies</HEAD>

   The first big radio telescope array
in the Southern Hemisphere began operating Friday, opening a new
window on the little-explored southern sky.
   ``We'll be looking at the center of our galaxy because it passes
right above our head in the Southern Hemisphere,'' said Dr. Ron
Ekers, the director of the instrument named the Australia
Telescope. ``Much of the galaxy and the nearest neighboring galaxy,
the Magellanic Cloud is not visible to observatories in the
Northern Hemisphere.''
   Ekers, who for seven years was director of the 27-dish, Very
Large Array radio telescope in western New Mexico, said the
telescope will study black holes and pulsars.
   The new $40 million instrument located on the windswept plains
of western New South Wales, consists of five new 72.6-foot dishes
mounted on 1.86 miles of railroad track.
   An identical dish on a track 1.86 miles away will make the array
equivalent to one dish with a diameter 3.72 miles.
   When linked to the exisiting 211-foot-dish at Parkes 241 miles
to the south and others spread across the continent, the Australia
Telescope can be extended like a zoom lens on a camera, to the
equivalent of a dish 2,400 miles in diameter.
   The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Organization, the
government- funded research institution that designed the
telescope, said the compact array of seven telescopes had an
equivalent resolution to being able to read a telephone directory
at a distance of 660 feet.
   When linked to telescopes in space, it would be 10,000 times
greater.
   ``The Australia Telescope is the state of the art in
astronomical technology, it is one of the best telescopes in the
world,'' Prime Minister Bob Hawke told an audience of astronomers
and scientists at the inaugural ceremony.
   Harry Van der Laan, head of the European Southern Observatory in
Chile, said: ``If Australia hadn't built it, the European Southern
Observatory would have had to do it in Chile.''
   ``We have the biggest optical telescopes in the Southern
Hemisphere at La Silla in Chile, but we had no major radio
telescope array. World astronomy cannot do without it,'' he said.
   ``This fills that gap and it puts Australia back in the top
league of astronomy. Its the equivalent of winning the America's
Cup in yachting,'' Van der Laan said.
