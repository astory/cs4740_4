<HEAD>Four GOP Candidates Scrap for Chance to Take on Montana's Baucus</HEAD>

   Max Baucus remembers well the surprise
defeat that Montana voters dealt fellow Democratic Sen. John
Melcher in 1988, and he's maneuvering early to avoid a similar fate.
   The two-term senator faces little challenge in the Democratic
primary on June 5, but he's amassing a stash of campaign cash to
combat the winner of the four-way Republican primary.
   Baucus has raised about $2 million for what he expects will be a
$2.5 million campaign, the most expensive in the history of rural
Montana.
   Two years ago, the National Republican Senatorial Committee
pumped $205,000 into the state GOP, including $138,000 in the last
month of the campaign, to help challenger Conrad Burns overtake
Melcher.
   Baucus said the national GOP has targeted him in hopes of a
repeat.
   ``Republican candidates have said they and the Republican
National Committee will do whatever it takes to win this seat,''
Baucus said.
   The likely beneficiary of that Republican support is unclear.
   A statewide poll taken in April showed no clear leader in the
GOP race between Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad and businessman-scientist
Bruce Vorhauer. State Sen. Bill Farrell and former business
executive John Domenech lagged behind.
   In the Democratic primary, Baucus is heavily favored over John
Driscoll, a member of the state Public Service Commission, and
Billings evangelist Curly Thornton.
   Driscoll has attacked Baucus for obtaining 86 percent of his
campaign financing from out-of-state interests. But most of the
debate has been among the GOP candidates.
   Kolstad has made an issue of his lifelong ties to Montana,
contrasting his background to that of Vorhauer, who became a state
resident only last fall, and Domenech, who moved to Bozeman four
years ago.
   Farrell has accused Kolstad of not addressing the issues.
Vorhauer and Farrell have taken a pro-choice position on abortion,
while Kolstad and Domenech are anti-abortion.
   For the most part, the Republicans have similar views on other
issues and emphasize differences in style and personality.
   Kolstad, 58, was a state legislator for 20 years and operates a
family farm and ranch in north-central Montana. He joined Stan
Stephens in the 1988 gubernatorial race to become the No. 2 person
in Montana's first GOP administration in 20 years.
   Kolstad was the last to enter the Senate race, but yielded to
entreaties from President Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, former
President Reagan and other national GOP leaders seeking a
well-known challenger.
   Farrell, 41, who owns a trucking company, stresses the
blue-collar roots that he believes set him apart from the other
candidates.
   Domenech, 36, quit his job as president of a pharmaceutical
testing firm to run for the Senate. He touts his business
experience and said he decided to run because he was angry about a
lack of economic opportunities in Montana.
   Vorhauer, 48, best known as the inventor of the Today
contraceptive sponge, has divided his time between California,
Nevada and Montana since 1979. He helped found or develop four
businesses in western Montana.
   Baucus, 48, was born and raised in Helena, the son of a
prominent Montana ranching family. He entered politics in 1972 when
he was elected to the state House. Two years later he went on to
Congress and served two House terms before being elected to the
Senate in 1978. He was re-elected in 1984 with 57 percent of the
vote.
   Driscoll is making his second challenge to Baucus; he finished
last in a three-way Democratic primary in 1978. Thornton, who has
made preaching against alcohol and drug abuse the centerpiece of
his campaign, was new to politics in 1988 when he finished last in
a six-man Democratic gubernatorial primary.

   Republican Senate candidate Allen Kolstad
has the White House on his side, but Sen. Max Baucus has the money,
the lead and widespread appeal among rural Montana voters.
   Kolstad, the state's lieutenant governor, is a wealthy rancher
and grain farmer who is trying to tar Baucus as a liberal in favor
of big government. Kolstad's conservative pitch even includes a
reminder that he ``opposes Ted Kennedy on most national issues.''
   But Baucus pays close attention to rural and economic concerns.
Pet issues include aid to rural hospitals, Essential Air Service
subsidies for rural airline routes and agricultural trade. He voted
against the 1990 farm bill, saying it didn't do enough for farmers.
   Kolstad was at least 20 points behind Baucus in an independent
mid-September poll. In addition, the Republican is up against the
largest campaign bankroll in Montana history.
   Baucus raised $1.9 million in the 18 months ending in June, a
princely sum in a state with only 800,000 people. Aggressive
fund-raising efforts continue.
   Baucus says he's just taking precautions.
   Kolstad had only $267,000 in campaign funds on June 30, but if
the race gets closer, he may look to national GOP groups for
eleventh-hour fund-raising help.
   That approach worked in 1988, when political newcomer Conrad
Burns narrowly upset two-term Democratic Sen. John Melcher of
Montana to become the first Republican U.S. senator from this state
in 36 years. The huge infusions of cash used to help Burns are
being challenged in a lawsuit and in a complaint before the Federal
Election Commission.
   ``If someone unfairly attacks me, I'm going to respond,'' says
Baucus. ``I just have be to prepared for the possibility that I'll
face the same deluge of dollars.''
   In the 1988 race, Burns, a former farm-and-ranch broadcaster,
attacked Melcher as a liberal out of touch with conservative, rural
Montana.
   Kolstad has adopted the same strategy.
   ``More federal bureaucracy, more federal control, the higher
deficits - there are the things I'm going to be fighting against in
Washington,'' says Kolstad.
   Like Burns, Kolstad was recruited by national GOP heavyweights,
including President Bush and former President Reagan. Bush raised
more than $100,000 for Kolstad when the president traveled to
Montana in July.
   Kolstad cannot claim the mantle of political outsider. He spent
20 years in the Montana Legislature before winning the lieutenant
governorship on the GOP ticket with Gov. Stan Stephens in 1988.
   The Stephens-Kolstad adminstration has not been universally
popular in Montana, struggling with tax and budget issues and
controversial appointees. Recent polls show his ``negatives''
nearly doubled since a similar poll in mid-June.
   Kolstad, 58, says he is saving his money for a last-minute
barrage of media advertising attacking Baucus on his votes against
defense spending, tax cuts and budget-balancing measures.
   The 48-year-old Baucus, running for a third term, has been
working hard to dispel whatever liberal image he may have had.
   He earns relatively high marks from most liberal interest groups
but insists he doesn't care about ratings.
   ``I don't look left, I don't look right, I look forward - to
what is the best solution for Montana,'' says Baucus. ``Most people
are more concerned with producing results for Montana than with
labels.''
   Baucus has barely mentioned Kolstad in campaign materials,
preferring instead to emphasize efforts he says have created or
protected jobs in economically depressed Montana.
   While differences between the candidates exist - Baucus is
pro-choice on abortion, Kolstad is not, for example - the race has
generated few fireworks.

   Montanan John Melcher is using pastoral
politics in his fight to retain his U.S. Senate seat and prevent
Conrad Burns from becoming the state's first Republican senator
since 1952.
   ``Every election some greenhorn runs against Doc Melcher,'' says
a talking cow in one Melcher campaign ad. ``They come in thinking
they can put Doc out to pasture.''
   ``But they leave with egg on their faces, and even worse on their
shoes,'' chuckles another cud-chewing bovine.
   Melcher, a veterinarian and two-term senator, holds a
double-digit lead over Burns in recent state polls, but the
Republican county commissioner from Billings is waging a spirited
challenge.
   ``I just think John Melcher is completely out of step with the
majority of Montanans,'' says Burns, who has been hammering away at
his opponent as ``too liberal'' and an ineffective member of the
Senate.
   The liberal accusation is nothing new for Melcher, who was
targeted for defeat by the National Conservative Political Action
Committee in 1982.
   He responded with TV ads that featured talking cows ridiculing
NCPAC as a herd of city-slickers trying to fool Montanans about
``old Doc Melcher.''
   Earlier this year, Burns picked up on the theme, warning voters
that Doc Melcher's cows would be ``spreading real bull'' this
election. In response, the incumbent senator again trotted out his
campaign cows.
   Melcher, 64, a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee,
portrays himself as a fighter who stands up for family farmers,
workers and Montana's basic industries _ timber, mining and
agriculture.
   In 1985, he fought Reagan administration attempts to reduce price
supports for grain, cotton and rice.
   ``If what I get done is beneficial, then that's how I should be
judged,'' he says. ``There are very few people in Congress who
understand what the West is all about.''
   Melcher is also considered something of a maverick. He was one of
only two senators who voted against the Omnibus Drug Bill of 1986,
one of only three who opposed the 1986 tax overhaul bill, and one of
only three who voted against the U.S.-Canadian trade agreement this
year.
   Melcher received high ratings from many liberal groups, but he
has voted with conservatives on several key issues.
   He opposed the Panama Canal treaty in 1978, supported Reagan's
1981 tax cuts and the balanced-budget law and is a staunch opponent
of abortion.
   Burns, 53, operated a farm-and-ranch broadcasting service until
he ran for commissioner in Montana's largest county in 1986. He
upset the Democratic incumbent, and announced earlier this year he
would take on Melcher.
   ``There's quite a bit of dissatisfaction here in the state of
Montana,'' he says. ``I don't think we can stand six more years of
the same.''
   folksy, personable campaigner, Burns has been barnstorming the
state, meeting voters door-to-door. He says his outgoing, friendly
style will be more effective in the Senate than Melcher's
``obstructionist'' tactics.
   But Burns' media campaign carries a strident tone, labeling
Melcher as soft on drugs, crime, and defense, and describing him as
a big-spending liberal who likes to raise taxes.
   Some of Burns' advertising was prepared with help from the
Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, which helped recruit him
as a candidate and considers him one of the GOP's best shots at
knocking off an incumbent Senate Democrat in 1988.
   Burns' Montana managers have denied suggestions that the national
committee is calling the shots for the campaign, but say the
assistance is welcome and needed to offset Melcher's 2-to-1
advantage in campaign funds.
   Despite polls showing him behind, Burns is convinced he has a
chance. He says his agricultural background will help him cut into
Melcher's power base in eastern Montana, which Melcher represented
in Congress for 7{ years.
   ``I think it's going to be tighter than a new pair of shoes,''
Burns says of the election.

<TEXT>
   Montana Republicans tapped Lt. Gov. Allen
Kolstad to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, who brushed
aside his primary opposition but said he's taking nothing for
granted in November.
   Baucus, raised more than $2 million in campaign money even before
Tuesday's primary victory, but recalled the 1988 upset of Democratic
Sen. John Melcher by upstart Republican Conrad Burns.
   ``One never takes anything for granted _ ever,'' said Baucus, 48.
   Kolstad, a 58-year-old farmer-rancher and 20-year veteran of
Montana politics, bested three rivals in a hotly contested GOP
primary.
   With 98 percent of 967 precincts reporting early today, Kolstad
had 36,897 votes, or 43 percent; to 30,451 votes, or 36 percent, for
scientist-businessman Bruce Vorhauer; 11,484, or 13 percent, for
state Sen. Bill Farrell; and 6,525, or 8 percent, for businessman
John Domenech.
   Kolstad promised a campaign that would ``keep Senator Baucus up
against the ropes right from the beginning.''
   ``We're just going to have to outwork him,'' he said. ``We're
used to putting in a lot of 16- and 18-hour days on the ranch. We're
going to convert that energy into the campaign.''
   Baucus had 79,131 votes, or 83 percent, to 12,444 votes, or 13
percent for state Public Service Commissioner John Driscoll; and
4,321 votes, or 5 percent, for evangelist Curly Thornton.
   Kolstad was recruited by national Republicans, including
President Bush and former President Reagan. Baucus, pointing to the
national GOP involvement, predicted that Kolstad's campaign would be
run from Washington.
   Kolstad, emphasized his farming background and his lifelong ties
to Montana. The emphasis also was a slap at Vorhauer, who moved his
legal residence to Montana only last fall.
   Vorhauer, 48, is best known as the inventor of the Today
contraceptive sponge. His campaign stressed his engineering and
science background as qualifying him to bring high-tech businesses
to the state.
   Farrell, 41, who operates a small independent trucking firm,
touted his working-man image. Domenech, 36, campaigned for a
national health plan.
   Baucus ran a quiet primary campaign, with neither of his
challengrs having much in the way of money or organizations.

   Sen. Max Baucus and his Democratic
supporters say they're bracing for an avalanche of Republican cash
in this fall's general election battle with Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad.
   But Baucus, a two-term Democrat who was nominated for re-election
Tuesday, has his own pile of campaign cash, which Republicans are
trying to turn into a liability rather than an asset.
   ``Senator Baucus will learn the hard way that Montana cannot be
bought with an out-of-state war chest,'' said Montana GOP Chairman
Barbara Campbell. ``Does he need $2 million to get re-elected to a
job he's held for 12 years? That says he's very weak.''
   Baucus coasted past two primary opponents Tuesday with 83 percent
of the Democratic vote, while Kolstad won a four-man race with 43
percent of the GOP vote.
   Kolstad and the Republicans are hoping for a repeat of 1988, when
upstart Republican Conrad Burns pulled off an upset victory over
two-term incumbent Democratic Sen. John Melcher.
   Kolstad promised Wednesday to run an above-board campaign
focusing on economic issues and refraining from personal attacks.
But Democratic Party Chairman Bruce Nelson said he expects Kolstad
to go on the offensive against Baucus.
   ``The pattern that Republicans set two years ago of a relentless
negative attack is the same thing that they will do this year,'' he
predicted.
   Baucus already has raised more than $2 million in campaign funds,
smashing the state campaign-spending record of $1.2 million set by
Melcher in 1988.

   Republican Conrad Burns only has two years
of political experience but the folksy former broadcaster is not
intimidated by the transition from county commissioner to the
powerful U.S. Senate.
   ``There's really no difference. We're just dealing in more zeros.
The responsibility's the same,'' said Burns after writing himself
into Montana history with an upset victory over two-term Democratic
Sen. John Melcher.
   On a day that saw Republicans capture the presidency, the
governorship and the state Senate, Burns became the first Republican
senator from Montana in 36 years and only the second man ever to
defeat an incumbent U.S. senator in Montana.
   ``It's nice to have a personal friend in the statehouse and it's
nice to have a personal friend in the White House,'' Burns said
Tuesday night.
   The 53-year-old Burns is a Yellowstone County commissioner from
Billings, Montana's largest city. He entered politics only two years
ago after a career as a broadcaster, livestock show manager and
field representative for a ranching publication.
   Burns barnstormed the state, meeting voters door-to-door and
telling them his outgoing, friendly style will be more effective in
the Senate than Melcher's ``obstructionist'' tactics.
   Burns campaigned as a conservative, saying Melcher was ``too
liberal'' for Montana and not an effective senator. He also labeled
Melcher a supporter of higher taxes and promised to vote against any
tax increasing, saying the federal deficit can be balanced by
restraining spending.
   ``I always like to win, but I enter all these things realizing
that voters may not approve,'' Melcher said early Wednesday. ``And
if they don't, you have to accept that.''
   The Republican National Senatorial Committee helped recruit Burns
as a candidate and assisted his campaign with money and advice.

   Primaries in seven states cleared the way for
multimillion-dollar Senate battles in New Jersey and California,
and Republicans said Wednesday the results also bolstered their
hopes of ousting Sens. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and John Melcher
of Montana.
   In California, voters rejected propositions authorizing an AIDS
quarantine, closing the Rancho Seco nuclear plant, dividing mammoth
San Bernardino County in two and relaxing state spending limits
imposed after tax-slashing Proposition 13 was passed a decade ago.
   Tuesday's ballots also included one race for governor and one
for mayor. In Montana, former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge captured
the nomination to succeed retiring Democrat Ted Schwinden, scoring
39 percent of the vote in a six-man race. He will face Republican
former state Sen. Stan Stephens. In San Diego, Mayor Maureen
O'Connor was elected to a full four-year term with 58 percent of
the vote.
   In congressional races, California Rep. Ernest Konnyu, a
freshman Republican from the San Jose suburb of Saratoga, became
the first incumbent to lose a primary this year, falling by a 58
percent-to-42 percent margin to Tom Campbell, a politically
moderate Stanford professor.
   Newark, N.J., Councilman Donald Payne won the Democratic
nomination in the 10th District with 73 percent of the vote for a
chance to succeed retiring Peter Rodino and become the state's
first black in Congress. Victory in the primary is tantamount to
election in the overwhelmingly Democratic district.
   Oliver North, the fired White House national security aide
indicted in the Iran-Contra affair, scored a personal success as a
campaigner when two Republicans for whom he stumped in Southern
California won congressional primaries. Former deputy White House
counsel Christopher Cox was the victor over 12 rivals in the 40th
District and former Reagan administration speechwriter Dana
Rohrabacher topped an eight-candidate field in the 42nd District.
   In Senate races, first-term New Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg
polled 77 percent of the vote against two challengers and will
defend his seat against Pete Dawkins, a former star athlete, Rhodes
scholar and Vietnam War hero who moved from New York to New Jersey
to make his first bid for office.
   The two expect to spend a total of $14 million on the race,
which the national GOP has targeted as vital to its hopes of
recapturing the Senate. Democrats now control it 54-46.
   In California, Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy shrugged off
three primary opponents for the right to challenge first-term
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson.
   ``Wilson has spent $7 million already on his re-election, and
his numbers are exactly where they were 18 months ago, at 50
percent, which is the definition of a very vulnerable incumbent,''
said Anita Dunn, communications director for the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington.
   Her counterpart in the GOP, Tom Mason, saw vulnerability on the
Democratic side in Montana, where Sen. John Melcher won nomination
to a third term with 76 percent of the vote against a political
newcomer.
   ``The good news for us is that Melcher's 76 percent against a
nobody tells us a good manifestation of voter dissatisfaction,''
Mason said.
   Melcher, not surprisingly, took exception to that analysis.
   ``I think the Republican Senatorial Committee would like to
capture this seat,'' he said. ``I'm going to make sure that doesn't
happen.''
   The Republican candidate, county commissioner Conrad Burns, said
he expected Melcher to attack him as inexperienced, but added,
``When you're green, you're growing, and when you're ripe, you're
rotten.... That's how we'll counter.''
   Mason also said the victory by state Sen. Bill Valentine in New
Mexico's four-man GOP Senate primary put him in good shape for a
run at first-term Democrat Bingaman.
   ``It was a clean campaign, and there are no scars left, so we
can focus on Bingaman's lack of name ID and lack of depth of
support,'' Mason said.
   Valentine immediately attacked his rival as too liberal for New
Mexico, saying Bingaman supported ``big labor, big government and
big spending on the part of Washington.''
   With 97 percent of the vote counted, Valentine had 33,698 votes
or 43 percent, and his closest challenger, former Interior
Department official Rick Montoya, had 22,392 votes or 28 percent.
   In other voting Tuesday, Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy, a
son-in-law of former Gov. George C. Wallace, won the Democratic
nomination to the Alabama Supreme Court; five supporters of Lyndon
LaRouche all lost congressional primaries in Iowa; and in South
Dakota, there were no statewide races and only 26 primaries for the
105 state Senate and House seats.

   The former executive director of the
Montana Republican Party has accused the organization, its
chairwoman and a national GOP committee of breaking federal
racketeering laws.
   The allegations involved the handling of political money during
the 1988 campaigns.
   Terry Merica made the allegations in a complaint filed in U.S.
District Court on Wednesday. It amends a lawsuit he and his wife,
Neida, filed in December.
   The complaint alleges that the state GOP, Chairwoman Barbara
Campbell and the National Republican Senatorial Committee committed
wire and mail fraud by illegally funneling money into the campaigns
of Sen. Conrad Burns and Gov. Stan Stephens.
   Burns, at the time a county commissioner in Billings, upset
Democratic incumbent Sen. John Melcher in the November election.
Stephens defeated former Democratic Gov. Tom Judge in the race for
governor.
   The complaint says the defendants used a series of letters and
money transfers in the spring and summer of 1988 to defraud the
citizens of Montana and the United States.
   The original lawsuit alleged the Mericas were fired in late 1988
for questioning whether financial dealings between the state
Republican Party and the national committee violated state and
federal election laws.
   Neida Merica was an administrative secretary for the state GOP.
   Wednesday's complaint contends there were additional violations
of the federal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act.
   Charles Erdmann, attorney for the Montana GOP, said the new
contentions may reflect Merica's concern that the original suit
will be dismissed.
   ``This may be nothing more than an attempt to bolster their
complaint,'' he said.
   He would not comment on specifics, saying he had not seen the
new complaint, but he questioned the timing of its filing. The
state GOP convention began Thursday in Billings, with President
Bush scheduled to appear in the evening on behalf of Lt. Gov. Allen
Kolstad, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Sen. Max Baucus.
   ``The timing of this would make you think this is politically
motivated,'' Campbell said Thursday.
   James Goetz, the Mericas' attorney, said the timing was
coincidence.
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps
organize campaigns of GOP Senate candidates, had no immediate
comment on the new allegations.
   The complaint alleges the defendants committed mail and wire
fraud by not legally reporting as much as $200,000 in campaign
contributions in 1988.
   It cites several instances of questionable handling of campaign
financing. It alleges that:
   _The national committee conducted a voter identification project
in Montana, but gave results only to the Burns and Stephens
campaigns. The cost of the project was never reported as a
contribution to the campaigns and the expense exceeded the federal
limit on what such committees can give to a candidate.
   _The national committee transferred thousands of dollars through
the Montana GOP's accounts to help pay for a direct mailing by a
Texas company for the Burns campaign in violation of federal
election laws.
   _Between Aug. 8, 1988, and Nov. 16, 1988, the national committee
shifted $178,145 into the Montana GOP's account. The money
transfers prompted a Nov. 8 memo from Ward Shanahan, the state
party's lawyer, to GOP headquarters warning that the national
committee was using the Montana Republican Party for ``financial
shenanigans.''
   _In October 1988, the Republican Governors' Association gave
$8,000 to the Montana GOP with a letter from Executive Director
Michele Davis saying the money should be reported as coming from
the Republican National Committee.

   Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad on Tuesday defeated
three fellow Republicans for the right to challenge Sen. Max Baucus
in a bid to repeat the GOP's 1988 feat of knocking off a Democratic
incumbent.
   Baucus, seeking his third term, had no trouble turning back a
challenge for the Democratic nomination from John Driscoll, a Public
Service Commission member, and evangelist Curly Thornton.
   With 694 of 967 precincts reporting, Kolstad had 27,250 votes, or
42 percent, to 23,352 votes, or 36 percent, for businessman and
scientist Bruce Vorhauer; 8,569 votes, or 13 percent for state Sen.
Bill Farrell; and 4,981 votes, or 8 percent, for former business
executive John Domenech.
   In the Democratic race, Baucus had 61,054 votes, or 83 percent,
to 9,538 votes for Driscoll, or 13 percent, and 3,192 votes for
Thornton, or 4 percent.

   The Senate race was the only major contest on the Montana ballot.
Republicans are hoping for a replay this fall of the 1988 general
election, when Conrad Burns, a relatively unknown county
commissioner from Billings, toppled veteran Democratic Sen. John
Melcher.
   National Republicans, including President Bush and former
President Ronald Reagan, searched for a well-known Republican to
challenge Baucus. They recruited Kolstad, 58, who became lieutenant
governor only 17 months ago.
   Kolstad emphasized his farming background, his 20 years in the
state Legislature and his lifelong ties to Montana. The emphasis
also was a slap at Vorhauer, who moved his legal residence to
Montana only last fall.
   Vorhauer, 48, is best known as the inventor of the Today
contraceptive sponge. His campaign stressed his engineering and
science background as qualifying him to bring high-tech businesses
to the state.
   Farrell, 41, a trucking company owner, touted his working-man
image. Domenech, 36, campaigned for a national health plan.
   Baucus ran a quiet primary campaign, with neither of his
challengers having much money or elaborate organizations. Baucus has
raised about $2 million, citing the Republican challenge he will
face this fall.

   California voters Tuesday decided whether to shut down a nuclear
plant and permit the quarantining of AIDS victims, while two Newark
councilmen vied for a chance to become New Jersey's first black
congressman.
   Four U.S. Senate races also were on the ballots as seven states
held primaries, and Montana had a wide-open race for governor,
highlighted by former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge's comeback bid.
   The liveliest Senate primary was in New Mexico, where polls
showed state Sen. Bill Valentine leading three fellow Republicans
for the nomination to oppose first-term Democratic Sen. Jeff
Bingaman.
   Three other Senate primaries were all Democratic skirmishes
leading to the main event in November. First-term Sen. Frank
Lautenberg of New Jersey had two little-known opponents as he sought
to defend his seat against Republican Peter Dawkins; Montana Sen.
John Melcher had one challenger in his bid for a third term against
Republican Conrad Burns, and California Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy was
favored over three rivals to win a chance to face Republican Sen.
Pete Wilson.
   In Newark's heavily Democratic 10th district, where Rep. Peter
Rodino was retiring after 40 years, black City Councilmen Donald
Payne and Ralph Grant competed in the Democratic primary. The winner
was expected to defeat the GOP nominee, political newcomer Michael
Webb, who also is black.
   In Montana, Judge was one of six Democrats who entered the race
for governor after Democrat Ted Schwinden decided not to seek a
third term. Former state Sen. Stan Stephens and state Rep. Cal
Winslow were the only Republican candidates left after the early
favorite, Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, was killed in a plane
crash in April.
   San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor was seeking a full four-year
term and needed a majority in the non-partisan primary to avoid a
runoff in the nation's seventh-largest city.
   Californians confronted their usual slew of ballot measures,
including proposals to ease state spending limits, curb campaign
spending, slow growth and declare AIDS a communicable disease,
subjecting victims to potential quarantine.
   In Sacramento County, a measure seeking closure of the Rancho
Seco nuclear power plant could mark the first time in history that
voters have directly ordered the shutdown of such a facility.
   And in San Bernardino County, geographically the nation's
largest, voters were asked to carve away the eastern, desert portion
to create a new jurisdiction called Mojave County.
   Here are highlights of voting in the other states:
   ALABAMA _ Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy, a son-in-law of former Gov.
George C. Wallace, was running for the Democratic nomination to
state Supreme Court on a slate supported by trial lawyers and
opposed by big business and insurance companies.
   IOWA _ Sixteen supporters of extremist Lyndon LaRouche were
running in Democratic primaries, five for congressional nominations
and the rest in state legislative districts.
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ No statewide races were on the ballot and there
were only 26 primary races for the 105 state Senate and House seats.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In the Senate races, the national GOP has hopes of unseating both
Bingaman and Lautenberg. New Mexico Republicans have portrayed
Bingaman as too liberal for a state that has long supported heavy
defense spending. In New Jersey, Dawkins, a Heisman trophy winner,
Rhodes scholar and Vietnam War hero, moved to the Garden State to
enter the race and based his early campaigning mainly on his
impressive resume.
   Both states have Republican governors who will campaign for the
GOP Senate candidates.
   California's Wilson has been far ahead of McCarthy in
fund-raising and the polls. His biggest obstacle appears to be a
jinx on his Senate seat which has prevented any occupant from
winning re-election in more than 30 years.
   Burns, the Republican nominee in Montana, is a commissioner in
Yellowstone County who has yet to achieve much statewide
recognition. A Minnesota man withdrew from the GOP race too late for
his name to be taken off the ballot.
   Schwinden's retirement after two terms in Montana left the
governorship without a Democratic incumbent on the ballot for the
first time in 20 years. Schwinden had defeated Judge in the primary
in 1980.
   Rodino, the House Judiciary chairman who led the impeachment
hearings against former President Nixon, is stepping down amid
growing sentiment that his predominantly black district should be
represented by a black. He made no endorsement in the primary.
   The AIDS measure, sponsored by LaRouche supporters, was opposed
by the California Medical Association and the leadership of both
major parties. It was almost identical to a plan defeated by a 2-1
margin in 1986.

   County Commissioner Conrad Burns may not
know it yet, but his defeat of two-term U.S. Sen. John Melcher put
him in Montana's history books.
   Burns' win Tuesday made him only the second man to defeat an
incumbent U.S. senator in Montana. It also made him the first
Republican senator from Montana in 36 years.
   Burns, a farm-and-ranch broadcaster and a county commissioner in
Billings who was making his second try for elective office, defeated
Melcher 52 percent to 48 percent.
   Republican Stan Stephens won the Montana gubernatorial race,
defeating former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge by 189,630 votes to
168,537 votes, a margin of 53 percent to 47 percent. Stephens will
be the first Republican governor in 20 years.
   George Bush captured Montana's four electoral votes, defeating
Michael Dukakis 53 percent to 47 percent. Bush had 189,598 votes to
168,120 cast for Dukakis.
   Melcher had been targeted for defeat by the Republican National
Senatorial Committee, which helped recruit Burns and funneled almost
$400,000 into his campaign.
   ``I was hoping to campaign for a month solid,'' Melcher said.
``I've only been out here just about 17 or 18 days. I never really
had a good feel for the race.''
   Stephens, a former radio broadcaster and cable television company
owner from Havre, said his victory reflected Montana's desire ``to
put someone with business experience in the executive position of
the state.''
   Both Montana U.S. House seats went to the incumbents, Democrat
Pat Williams and Republican Ron Marlenee.
   Montana voters refused to repeal the state's mandatory seat-belt
law; approved repeal of the constitutional right of the needy to
welfare benefits; and defeated a mandatory deposit on beverage
containers.

   Two-term Democratic U.S. Sen. John Melcher
lost to a Republican county commissioner and Republicans captured
the Montana governor's mansion after 20 years of Democratic control.
   Republican George Bush won the state's four electoral votes.
   Conrad Burns, a commissioner from Montana's most populous county
which includes Billings, became the first GOP senator from Montana
in 36 years.
   Burns said taxes and the Montana wilderness bill sponsored by
Melcher but vetoed last week by President Reagan were keys to his
victory Tuesday.
   ``The 101st Congress is really going to have to knuckle down and
go to work on this deficit,'' he said.
   Melcher said he'd only been campaigning for about 18 days and ``I
never really had a good feel for the race.''
   With 98 percent of the precincts reporting, Burns had 184,789, or
52 percent, and Melcher, 170,149, or 48 percent.
   In the governor's race, Republican Stan Stephens, a former state
senator, defeated former Democrat Gov. Tom Judge, who was seeking
his third term after losing in his party's primary eight years ago
to retiring Gov. Ted Schwinden.
   ``I'd like to think we won the contest because people realize we
represent change,'' said Stephens, a Canadian immigrant who came to
Montana to harvest wheat 39 years ago.
   Stephens had 185,256 votes, 53 percent, to Judge's 164,111 votes,
47 percent.
   Bush collected 185,688 for 53 percent, Democrat Michael Dukakis
had 163,507 for 47 percent.
   Montana's two congressmen, a Republican and a Democrat, were
re-elected.

<HEAD>California, North Carolina Races Top Primary Lineup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A bitter primary campaign for governor of California is winding
down in a flurry of television commercials while North Carolina
Democrats are choosing a challenger to Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.
All told, candidates in nine states are vying for support Tuesday,
1990's busiest primary election day so far.
   Democrats Dianne Feinstein and John Van de Kamp have spent months
attacking each other's positions on abortion, the death penalty and
how to deal with California's $3.6 billion budget deficit.
   Polls suggested their race was a dead heat as they entered the
last weekend of the primary campaign.
   On the Republican side, Sen. Pete Wilson faced only token primary
opposition and sat on a huge campaign war chest as he waited to
learn which Democrat would be his opponent in the race to succeed
retiring Gov. George Deukmejian, a Republican.
   In North Carolina, Harvey Gantt and Mike Easley were in a runoff
for the Democratic Senate nomination. Gantt, the former mayor of
Charlotte, finished first in a six-way primary May 8, but failed to
get the 40 percent necessary to avoid a runoff with the second-place
finisher.
   Meanwhile, Helms has started running television ads accusing the
Democrats of throwing mud at him.
   Voters also will go to the polls Tuesday in Alabama, Iowa,
Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.
   In Alabama, five Democrats were battling for the right to
challenge Gov. Guy Hunt, the first Republican elected governor of
the state since Reconstruction. The contenders were state Attorney
General Don Siegelman, former Gov. Fob James, U.S. Rep. Ronnie
Flippo, state Sen. Charles Bishop, and Paul Hubbert, executive
director of the Alabama Education Association.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Republican state Sen. Bill
Cabannis were assured of their party nominations, setting up a
face-off in November.
   Abortion was the big issue in Iowa, where three Democrats were
vying to take on GOP Gov. Terry Branstad, an opponent of legalized
abortion. The Iowa chapter of the National Abortion Rights Action
League endorsed Don Avenson, speaker of the Iowa House, a move that
provoked an angry response from banker John Chrystal, who, like
Avenson, supports legal abortion.
   NARAL's decision to weigh in on the race was believed aimed at
the third Democrat, Attorney General Tom Miller, an opponent of
abortion. Miller was an early favorite in the race and NARAL leaders
were concerned the fall election would be between two opponents of
abortion.
   In the Senate primary in Iowa, incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin and
his GOP challenger, Rep. Tom Tauke, were assured of their party
nominations.
   Another crowded field was battling in Democratic and Republican
gubernatorial primaries in New Mexico, where incumbent Garrey
Carruthers, a Republican, was ineligible to seek a second term.
   For the first time in the state's history, the governor elected
in 1990 will be allowed to serve two consecutive four-year terms.
   The leading contenders on the Democratic side were Albuquerque
lawyer Paul Bardacke and rancher Bruce King, who already has served
eight years as governor, elected first in 1970 and again in 1978.
   Regarded as the top GOP contenders were Frank Bond, a former
legislator and education commissioner, and Les Houston, the
Republican leader of the state Senate.
   Four Republicans were competing in Montana to challenge
Democratic Sen. Max Baucus. Two years ago, underdog GOP challenger
Conrad Burns toppled Democratic Sen. John Melcher, and the
Republicans are hoping to repeat that success this year. Vying to
take on Baucus were Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad, state Sen. Bill Farrell,
and businessmen John Domenech and Bruce Vorhauer.
   Abortion was an issue in a three-way congressional primary in New
Jersey. state Assemblyman Rodney Frelinghuysen and state Sen.
Richard A. Zimmer, supporters of the pro-choice position, were
competing with professional football player Phil McConkey, an
abortion opponent, for the GOP nomination. The winner will face
Democrat Marguerite Chandler in November for the House seat held by
James Courter, the defeated GOP candidate for governor in 1989.
   The leading candidates in the Democratic primary to fill the
House seat formerly held by Democrat James Florio, the winner of
last year's campaign for governor of New Jersey, were Linda Bowker,
president of the state chapter of the National Organization for
Women and Camden County official Robert E. Andrews. Gloucester
County official Daniel Mangini had no opposition in the Republican
primary.
   The November lineups were virtually assured for Senate races in
New Jersey and New Mexico, where Democrat Bill Bradley and
Republican Pete Domenici were heavily favored for re-election. In
South Dakota, Republican Larry Pressler will be challenged in
November by Democrat Ted Muenster. In Mississippi, no Democrat filed
to oppose Republican Sen. Thad Cochran.
   Abortion was just one of the issues raised in the heated
California gubernatorial primary.
   The California governor's office was the biggest prize in the
1990 elections. The Democrats control the legislature and if they
can recapture the governor's office, the party will have the
political advantage next year when lines are redrawn for the state's
congressional districts. With 45 seats, California already has the
largest House delegation and the state is expected to gain six more
as a result of the 1990 Census.
   The Republicans recruited Wilson, re-elected to the Senate in
1988, to run for governor. Van de Kamp, the state attorney general,
was the early favorite for the Democratic nomination. But Feinstein,
the former mayor of San Francisco, surprised many observers with the
strength of her campaign.
   A supporter of the death penalty, Feinstein contrasted her
position with Van de Kamp's opposition to capital punishment. She
also suggested that as a woman, her pro-choice credentials were
stronger than Van de Kamp's.
   Van de Kamp said he personally opposes capital punishment but
would uphold California's death penalty, and countered with a
commercial saying he had put or kept 277 murderers on death row. His
most recent ad features an endorsement from consumer advocate Ralph
Nader, who labels Feinstein ``a Republican in Democratic clothing.''
   While the Democratic contenders were spending millions on
commercials in the primary, Wilson has raised close to $10 million
while facing only token primary opposition.
   Also on the ballot in California were two Republican-backed
propositions designed to dilute the legislature's power of
redistricting. One would require any plan to pass by a two-thirds
vote of both chambers, the other would remove it entirely and place
it in the hands of a non-partisan commission. Democrats oppose both
proposals.
   In North Carolina, Gantt, bidding to become the first black
Democrat ever elected to the Senate, and Easley have spent more time
attacking Helms than each other.
   And now the Republican senator has responded with an animated
television ad that shows a wooded scene with flowers blooming and
birds chirping. It then shifts to a bullet-riddled photo of Helms
nailed to a tree and closes with a blob of mud hitting the picture.
A voice then says, ``Isn't it nice that Mike Easley and Harvey Gantt
aren't running negative campaigns?''

   Voters rejected a possible AIDS quarantine in California,
nominated a councilman to become the first black congressman in New
Jersey, and launched a comeback by former Gov. Thomas Judge in
Montana.
   In other results from seven state primaries Tuesday, voters set
the stage for four Senate races:
   California _ Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy piled up 81
percent of the vote against three challengers and will oppose
moderate Republican Sen. Pete Wilson. McCarthy said he would attack
Wilson for a lack of leadership, adding, ``you must speak from your
convictions to people. You don't jump on winning sides.''
   New Jersey _ First-term Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg
trounced two opponents with 77 percent of the vote and will face
GOP newcomer Peter Dawkins, a former star athlete, Rhodes scholar
and Vietnam war hero. Dawkins criticized Lautenberg's opposition to
the death penalty and willingness to support tax increases.
Lautenberg said Dawkins, who recently moved to New Jersey, ``has
demonstrated a lack of knowledge'' about environmental and other
issues of concern to the state's voters.
   Montana _ Democratic Sen. John Melcher won 74 percent of the
vote against a political unknown in his bid for a third term and
will run against Republican Conrad Burns, a Yellowstone County
commissioner. ``I think it's pretty obvious I've been here
awhile,'' Melcher said from Washington. ``The longer you're here,
the more chances you have to get bills passed ... that will benefit
Montana.''
   New Mexico _ State Sen. Bill Valentine outpolled three
Republicans for the right to take on first-term Democratic Sen.
Jeff Bingaman. Valentine said Bingaman supported ``big labor, big
government and big spending on the part of Washington'' and had
fallen in line ``with the East Coast liberals.''
   With 97 percent of the vote counted, Valentine had 33,620 votes
or 43 percent, and his closest challenger, former Interior
Department official Rick Montoya, had 22,314 votes or 28.5 percent.
   The AIDS measure, backed by extremist Lyndon LaRouche, was one
of a slew of propositions in California. With 100 percent of the
precincts in, it was soundly defeated by 3,604,180 votes or 68
percent to 1,690,973 votes or 32 percent.
   Also rejected were proposals to relax limits on government
spending, and local measures to shut down the Rancho Seco nuclear
power plant and split mammoth San Bernardino County in two.
However, voters approved two state measures to cap campaign
spending.
   In San Diego, Mayor Maureen O'Connor won a full four-year term.
With 38.1 percent of the vote counted, she had 36,179 votes or 58.3
percent, and her closest rival, former Councilman Floyd Morrow, had
21,334 votes or 34.4 percent.
   Newark, N.J., City Councilman Donald Payne defeated a fellow
black councilman, Ralph Grant, to capture the Democratic nomination
for the seat held by Rep. Peter Rodino for 40 years. Payne will be
an overwhelming favorite against Republican Michael Webb, who also
is black.
   ``It gives our delegation the fairness it's been lacking for
many years,'' Payne said of the fact that he stands to become the
state's first black congressman. ``I can speak from a true urban
perspective.''
   With 98 percent of the vote counted, Payne had 39,681 votes or
73 percent and Grant had 14,576 votes or 27 percent.
   In Montana, Judge defeated five other Democrats who were enticed
into the race by the retirement of two-term Gov. Ted Schwinden.
   ``People remember we had eight good years,'' said Judge, who
served from 1973-1981 and was beaten by Schwinden in the 1980
primary. He said he also had ``put forth a program that the people
of this state have been waiting for.''
   The GOP primary victor, former state Sen. Stan Stephens, said
Judge ``represents an administration from yesteryear.''
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Judge had 45,826 votes
or 39.3 percent, former Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison had
31,718 votes or 27.2 percent and Attorney General Mike Greely had
26,497 votes or 22.7 percent.
   Stephens had 43,279 votes or 49.9 percent and state Rep. Cal
Winslow had 37,451 votes or 43.2 percent. The early favorite,
Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, was killed in a plane crash in
April, but his name was on the ballot and he had 6,045 votes or 7
percent.
   Here are highlights from the other states that voted:
   ALABAMA _ Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy, a son-in-law of former
Gov. George C. Wallace, won the Democratic nomination to state
Supreme Court on a slate supported by trial lawyers and opposed by
big business and insurance companies.
   IOWA _ Sixteen LaRouche supporters ran in Democratic primaries,
losing all five congressional nominations they sought and nine of
11 state legislative nominations. They won only in two districts
where they were unopposed.
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ No statewide races were on the ballot and there
were only 26 primary races for the 105 state Senate and House seats.

   Montana's Republicans on Tuesday chose
Conrad Burns, a county commissioner from Billings, to challenge
Democratic Sen. John Melcher, who smothered an obscure challenge in
his party's primary.
   Former Gov. Thomas Judge won the Democratic primary to vie for
the succession of retiring two-term Democratic Gov. Ted Schwinden,
and former state Sen. Stan Stephens won the GOP's gubernatorial
primary to oppose him.
   In the presidential primaries, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
easily outdistanced Jesse Jackson in the Democratic contest for
Montana's 19 delegates, while Vice President George Bush walked away
in GOP voting.
   Melcher, 64, seeking a third Senate term, put down an
underfinanced and barely visible challenge from Robert Kelleher, a
Billings lawyer.
   Burns beat Thomas Faranda, a Minnesotan who filed for the GOP
nomination but gave up his absentee bid weeks ago, though his name
remained on the ballot.
   Melcher said the difference between him and Burns was experience.
``I think it's pretty obvious I've been here awhile,'' he said.
``He's going to try and say that's a disadvantage, but I don't
really think it is.
   ``The longer you're here, the more chances you have to get bills
passed ... that will benefit Montana,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his suburban outside Washington, D.C.
   With 641 of 982 precincts, or 65 percent, reporting, Melcher had
55,011 votes or 74.7 percent compared to 18,609 or 25.3 percent for
Kelleher; Burns had 38,026 votes or 84.0 percent to 7,270 votes or
16.0 percent for Faranda.
   In the Democrats' six-candidate governor's primary, with 626
precincts reporting, or 64 percent, Judge won with 27,251 votes, or
39.5 percent; former Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison had 18,806
votes or 27.2 percent and Attorney General Mike Greeley had 15,607
votes or 22.6 percent.
   The other three candidates combined for nearly 11 percent of the
vote.
   In the Republican gubernatorial primary, former state Sen. Stan
Stephens won with 25,674 votes, or 48.9 percent to state Rep. Cal
Winslow's 23,168 votes, or 44.2 percent.
   Also seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination were State
Sen. Ted Neuman, Emmett ``Curly'' Thornton, an ex-drug addict turned
evangelist, and Martin ``Red'' Beckman, a tax protester.

   With Montana's economy in the doldrums, the campaign for governor
revolved around varying plans for reviving it. Central issues were
whether to enact a retail sales tax _ Montana has none _ and whether
to tap a multimillion-dollar trust fund built from coal severance
taxes during the boom years of energy exploration.
   Judge, who was governor during some of those boom years before
Schwinden beat him in the 1980 primary, harkened back to those days
in urging voters to return him to the statehouse. But his rivals
said the prosperity of those years had nothing to do with Judge.
   The keystone of Morrison's campaign was his pledge to veto any
sales tax, whatever its purpose or design.
   Winslow proposed a 3 percent sales tax as a replacement for
property taxes he said were too high.
   Republicans have not won the governorship in 20 years.

<HEAD>Seven States Vote In Year's Biggest State Primary Day So Far</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 1 graf after 5th graf, `New Jersey ...,' to UPDATE
with light turnout today in New Jersey.</NOTE>

   Primary voters today narrow the fields in four U.S. Senate races,
choose nominees for governor of Montana and pick a black Democratic
candidate for the New Jersey congressional seat occupied by Peter
Rodino for 40 years.
   In other highlights of voting in seven states, Californians
decide a large crop of propositions, including a measure sponsored
by supporters of extremist Lyndon LaRouche that would permit the
state to quarantine AIDS victims. Sacramento voters could become the
first in the nation to close a nuclear power plant, the troubled
Rancho Seco; and voters in San Bernardino County _ the nation's
largest _ will decide whether to carve away the eastern, desert
portion to create a new county called Mojave.
   In San Diego, the nation's seventh-largest city, Mayor Maureen
O'Connor is expected to win a four-year term by gaining a majority
in the nonpartisan primary. She was first elected two years ago
after Mayor Roger Hedgecock was convicted of a felony and forced to
resign.
   Both of the nation's first-term Democrats are among the senators
with a stake in today's races, and both have been targeted as
vulnerable by the national GOP. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey has
two little-known primary opponents, and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico
has none.
   New Jersey Republicans have united behind a single nominee, Peter
Dawkins, a former Heisman trophy winner, Rhodes scholar and Vietnam
war hero who moved to the state to enter the race.
   Voting officials in New Jersey reported a light turnout this
morning for the primary races.
   In New Mexico, four Republicans are competing for the chance to
face Bingaman. A poll taken last week for the Albuquerque Journal
showed state Sen. Bill Valentine leading the field with support of
29.5 percent of Republicans, but 38.9 percent were undecided.
   A third first-term senator seeking re-election is Republican Pete
Wilson of California. He has no primary competition, but does have a
jinx to worry about _ for 30 years, no one holding his Senate seat
has been elected more than once. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov.
Leo McCarthy is expected to dispatch three little-known opponents.
   Montana also has a Senate race, with two-term Democrat John
Melcher opposed in the primary by attorney Robert Kelleher, who
advocates a parliamentary form of government. Yellowstone County
Commissioner Conrad Burns is the only GOP entrant.
   But the liveliest race in Montana is for governor, since Democrat
Ted Schwinden's decision to retire after two terms has left the
ballot without an incumbent for the first time in 20 years.
   The six-way Democratic field features a comeback bid by former
Gov. Thomas Judge, who served two terms before losing to Schwinden
in the primary eight years ago. A Montana Poll taken last week
showed Judge was the choice of 28 percent of Democratic voters, but
35 percent were undecided.
   In the two-way Republican race, the poll showed a dead heat
between former state Sen. Stan Stephens and state Rep. Cal Winslow.
The GOP favorite, Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, was killed in a
plane crash in April.
   The retirement of Rodino, whose 79th birthday is today, comes
amid growing sentiment that his predominantly black district should
be represented by the state's first black congressman. Two black
Newark city councilmen, Donald Payne and Ralph Grant, are competing
in the Democratic primary, with the winner expected to defeat the
GOP nominee, political newcomer Michael Webb, who also is black.
   Here is a look at the other states voting today:
   ALABAMA _ Democratic Reps. Claude Harris of Tuscaloosa and Bill
Nichols of Sylacauga are favored to turn back primary challenges.
   Races for three Supreme Court seats have turned into unusually
rough-and-tumble scraps in which big business and insurance
companies are backing one slate of Democrats, while trial lawyers
and less conservative interests are backing another. One of the
candidates with trial lawyer support is Circuit Judge Mark Kennedy
of Montgomery, a son-in-law of former Gov. George C. Wallace. He is
running against Anniston lawyer A.W. Bolt, who is supported by
business lobbies, for an associate justice post.
   IOWA _ Sixteen LaRouche supporters are running in Democratic
primaries, five for congressional nominations and the rest in state
legislative districts. Four Democrats are seeking the nomination to
oppose first-term GOP Rep. Fred Grandy, who for years played Gopher
on television's ``The Love Boat.''
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ The state is having one of its quietest elections
in memory, with no statewide races on the ballot. And there are only
26 primary races for the 105 state Senate and House seats. The
state's lone congressman, Democratic Rep. Tim Johnson, is unopposed
in the primary as is his Republican challenger, state Treasurer
David Volk.

   Dianne Feinstein and John Van de Kamp brawled to the wire for one
of 1990's biggest political prizes, the Democratic nomination for
governor of California, and voters set lineups Tuesday for fall
contests in eight other states.
   The busiest primary night so far this campaign year saw North
Carolina Democrats deciding whether former Charlotte Mayor Harvey
Gantt or county prosecutor Mike Easley would get the formidable task
of challenging Republican Sen. Jesse Helms.
   Gantt was bidding to become the first black nominated for U.S.
Senate in North Carolina this century.
   ``I'm ready to get into this fight'' with Helms, Gantt said as he
cast his own ballot. ``I'm ready to get it on with him.''
   Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco, and Van de Kamp,
the state attorney general, have spent millions of dollars battling
each other and now the winner will plunge into an even more costly
and just as nasty general election race against Republican Sen. Pete
Wilson. He is trying to keep the California governor's office in GOP
control.
   Voters also were choosing nominees in New Jersey, Alabama, Iowa,
South Dakota, Montana, New Mexico, and Mississippi.
   As usual, California voters also were making decisions on ballot
propositions, including two that would strip the legislature of most
of its power to redraw legislative, including congressional,
district lines. California is likely to gain six U.S. House seats as
a result of the 1990 Census.
   Another California ballot proposal would double the gasoline tax
over the next five years and was being watched as a signal of a
shift in sentiment in the state where the anti-tax revolt began in
the 1970s.
   Seven senators and three governors were on ballots, none with
serious primary opposition.
   The senators were Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Howell
Heflin of Alabama, Max Baucus of Montana and Tom Harkin of Iowa. The
Republicans were Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Pete Domenici of
New Mexico and Thad Cochran of Mississippi.
   Long in advance of their formal nomination in the primary, Harkin
and Republican Rep. Tom Tauke began campaigning against each other
in what looks like one of the tightest Senate races of the year.
   Alabama Republican Bill Cabannis was geared to challenge Heflin
and Democrat Ted Muenster was taking on Pressler in South Dakota.
   In Montana, Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad and businessman Bruce Vorhauer
were the leading contenders for the Republican nomination to
challenge Baucus.
   Scores of primaries also were deciding the lineups for elections
to the House. One incumbent who faced a strong challenge was
Democratic Rep. Jim Bates of San Diego, who was rebuked by the House
Ethics Committee for sexual harassment of women employees.
   One of the hottest primaries for a congressional seat was in the
New Jersey district represented by James Courter, the unsuccessful
GOP candidate for governor in 1989. Courter is not seeking
re-election to the House and the Republican contenders to succeed
him include Assemblyman Rodney Frelinghuysen, state Sen. Richard A.
Zimmer and professional football player Phil McConkey.
   Marguerite Chandler was unopposed for the Democratic nomination.
   Gov. Guy Hunt of Alabama, the first Republican elected to that
office this century, was bidding for a second term and a crowded
field of Democrats was vying to challenge him.
   Former Gov. Fob James, educator-lobbyist Paul Hubbert, Rep.
Ronnie Flippo, and Attorney General Don Siegelman were the leading
contenders. No one was expected to get the clear majority needed to
avoid a June 26 runoff.
   In a race in which abortion was a major issue, Iowa Democrats
were choosing among Attorney General Tom Miller, House Speaker Don
Avenson and banker John Chrystal for the nomination to challenge
Republican Gov. Terry Branstad.
   Avenson and Chrystal support the pro-choice position, while
Miller and Branstad are abortion opponents.
   Republican Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico was ineligible to
seek re-election. Four Democrats, including former Gov. Bruce King,
and four Republicans were competing to succeed him. The next
governor will be the first allowed to serve two consecutive
four-year terms.

   South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson had no GOP primary opposition
as he seeks a second term. In November he will face former
Democratic state Sen. Bob Samuelson.
   Contrary to political tradition, President Bush and other top GOP
officials have not hesitated this year to intervene in party
primaries on behalf of candidates they believe would run strongest
against Democrats in the fall.
   The White House helped persuade Wilson _ who didn't need much
persuading _ to enter the California governor's race a year after he
won a $13 million campaign for re-election to the Senate.
   Control of the governor's office in California is the highest
priority for the leaders of both national parties.
   After the 1980 Census, Democrats had complete control of the
redistricting process in the state and Republicans claim it cost
them at least five U.S. House seats.
   Wilson already has $3.5 million in his campaign bank account and
there is speculation the GOP will spend close to $20 million in the
race to succeed Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, who decided
against seeking a third term.
   The White House recruited Kolstad to take on Baucus in Montana,
but the effort backfired when three other Republicans also entered
the race.
   The latest round of primaries saw no change in the issues mix
that has marked other races this year. Nor was there any diminution
in the negative tone of campaign commercials.
   The roughest rhetoric was in the Feinstein-Van de Kamp race and
it left some Democrats concerned about prospects for uniting the
party in time for the fall campaign.
   The death penalty, abortion and the environment were common
themes.
   In Iowa, the National Abortion Rights Action League endorsed
Avenson out of concern that a Democratic primary victory by Miller
would mean the choice in November would be between two abortion foes.
   Feinstein and Van de Kamp argued over which was more reliably
pro-choice.
   Van de Kamp campaigned over the weekend with Norma McCorvey, who
was the ``Jane Roe'' in the Supreme Court's landmark abortion
decision. McCorvey endorsed the California attorney general because
``I trust John Van de Kamp to defend the right I fought so hard to
win.''
   Feinstein countered that as a woman she would be the most
reliable guardian of the pro-choice position.

   Skirmishes over four U.S. Senate seats, a wide-open race for
Montana governor and a California potpourri of propositions
highlight the ballots in seven states Tuesday, the busiest state
primary day so far in 1988.
   In Newark, N.J., two black Democrats are competing for their
party's nomination to the congressional seat being vacated by Peter
Rodino after 40 years. In San Diego, Mayor Maureen O'Connor is
overwhelmingly favored to win election in a nonpartisan race to a
full four-year term.
   The California propositions include statewide measures that would
permit the quarantining of AIDS victims, ease the government
spending limits imposed by Proposition 13 a decade ago, and cap
runaway spending on political campaigns.
   In local measures of note, Sacramento voters could become the
first in the nation to close a nuclear power plant, the troubled
Rancho Seco facility; and voters in San Bernardino County _ the
nation's largest county _ will decide whether to carve away the
eastern, desert portion to create a new county called Mojave.
   The most hotly contested Senate primary is in New Mexico, where
four Republicans think first-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman is
vulnerable because of his liberal voting record in a state that
strongly supports defense spending. State Sen. Bill Valentine and
longtime party activist Corky Morris have held the lead in polls for
the GOP nomination. Bingaman is unopposed in the Democratic primary.
   The only other first-term Democrat seeking re-election this year,
Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, faces a challenge from two
little-known primary opponents. He is gearing up for his November
clash with the unopposed GOP nominee, Peter Dawkins, a Heisman
Trophy winner, Rhodes scholar and Vietnam War hero who resigned from
the Shearson-Lehman brokerage house in New York City last year and
moved to New Jersey.
   The national GOP has targeted both Bingaman and Lautenberg, and
both states have Republican governors who will campaign for the
party's nominee.
   In California, Republican Sen. Pete Wilson has no primary hurdle
as he seeks a second term, but he will have to overcome a jinx in
November _ for more than 30 years, no one has been re-elected to
that particular Senate seat. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Leo
McCarthy faces two political unknowns.
   The fourth Senate race is in Montana, where Democrat John Melcher
is seeking the nomination for a third term. His only primary
challenger is attorney Robert Kelleher, who advocates a
parliamentary form of government. The unopposed GOP candidate is
Conrad Burns, a Yellowstone County commissioner and former
broadcaster.
   Montana also features a lively race for governor, a post held by
Democrats for 20 years. Two-term Gov. Ted Schwinden's decision not
to run for a third term gave Republicans hope of recapturing the
office, but their leading candidate, Secretary of State Jim
Waltermire, was killed in an April plane crash. The remaining GOP
contenders are former state Sen. Stan Stephens and state Rep. Cal
Winslow.
   The six-man Democratic field includes a comeback bid by former
Gov. Thomas Judge, who lost to Schwinden in the 1980 primary. The
two other leading candidates are Attorney General Mike Greely, who
has a drunken driving conviction on his record, and former state
Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison Jr.
   Here is a look at the other states voting Tuesday:
   ALABAMA _ Democratic Reps. Claude Harris of Tuscaloosa and Bill
Nichols of Sylacauga are favored to turn back primary challenges.
   Races for three Alabama Supreme Court seats have turned into
unusually rough-and-tumble scraps in which big business and

   Four New Mexico Republicans compete for a chance to challenge
Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman and former Montana Gov. Thomas Judge
puts his comeback hopes on the line Tuesday, as seven states hold
primaries for state and local office.
   Senate races also are on tap in California, New Jersey and
Montana, while voters in Actims, and proposals to ease state spending limits
and curb
campaign spending.
   Locally, Sacramento voters could decide to close the Rancho Seco
nuclear power plant; San Bernardino County voters could split the
nation's largest county into two; and voters in seven Southern
California communities could impose limits on growth or force
developers to pay for it.
   San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who won a special election two
years ago after Roger Hedgecock was convicted of a felony, is
seeking a full four-year term. She is expected to win a majority in
the non-partisan primary and thus avoid a runoff.
   In New Jersey, Democratic Rep. Peter Rodino is giving up his seat
after 20 terms amid growing sentiment that his Newark-area district
should be represented by the state's first black congressman. Two
black Newark city councilmen, Donald Payne and Ralph Grant, are
competing in the Democratic primary, with the winner expected to
defeat the GOP nominee, political newcomer Michael Webb, who also is
black.
   In New Mexico's GOP Senate race, state Sen. Bill Valentine led
the four-candidate field in a poll taken last week for the
Albuquerque Journal. The national Republican Party has targeted
Bingaman as vulnerable because he is a first-term liberal Democrat.
Bingaman has no primary opposition.
   The GOP also has designs on another first-term Democratic
senator, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, who faces two little-known
candidates in Tuesday's primary. The only Republican contender is
Peter Dawkins, a former star athlete, Rhodes scholar and Vietnam War
hero who moved to New Jersey last year from New York to run for
office.
   A third Democratic senator seeking re-election is John Melcher of
Montana. To win a third term he must overcome attorney Robert
Kelleher in the primary and Republican Conrad Burns, a Yellowstone
County commissioner, in November.
   California's GOP Sen. Pete Wilson has no primary opponent, and
will likely face Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, who is running
against three political unknowns. Wilson has led in the polls, but
no one has been re-elected to his Senate seat for 30 years.
   In Montana's race for governor, Judge is one of six Democrats
seeking the nomination for the seat two-term Gov. Ted Schwinden is
relinquishing. Schwinden had defeated Judge in the 1980 Democratic
primary.
   A Montana Poll taken last week showed Judge was the choice of 28
percent of Democratic voters, but 35 percent were undecided.
   In the two-way Republican race, the poll showed a dead heat
between former state Sen. Stan Stephens and state Rep. Cal Winslow.
Republicans have not won the governorship in 20 years and the GOP
favorite, Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, was killed in a plane
crash in April.

<HEAD>Reagan Pocket Veto of Wilderness Bill Could Work Against GOP, Dems
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE DENNISON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's decision to pocket veto a
wilderness bill that would have released 4.1 million acres of land
for development could backfire against state GOP candidates, say
hopeful Democrats.
   But Republicans, who sought the veto claiming the bill did not
free up enough land, are looking to harvest votes from Reagan's
action _ only the second such veto in his eight years in office.
   Reagan announced Wednesday he would not sign a bill designating
1.43 million acres of roadless national forest land in Montana as
federally protected wilderness. It was only the second time he has
vetoed a state wilderness bill. He has signed more than 30.
   More than 6 million acres of Montana wilderness have been closed
to development because of federal court decisions in the late 1970s
and early 1980s. A wilderness bill from Congress is needed to
release any of this land for other use; the bill vetoed by Reagan,
by protecting 1.43 million acres, would have freed up the remaining
land.
   The White House denied the veto decision was political. But first
word of the veto came not from the White House but from Conrad
Burns, the GOP challenger to Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., who
sponsored the wilderness legislation.
   Polls show Burns in a close race with Melcher, and Burns
campaigned heavily in recent days on what he said would have been
the legislation's negative impact on Montana jobs.
   ``As our next senator, I will hold hearings across Montana on
this critical issue and work to pass wilderness legislation that is
in the best interest of all Montanans,'' he said in a statement
released with the veto announcement.
   Burns and the Republican candidates for the state's two
congressional seats all asked Reagan to veto the measure, saying it
would cost jobs by locking up too much land as wilderness and
wilderness study areas, putting miners and loggers out of work.
   Reagan offered the same explanation in his veto message and also
noted the bill designated almost twice the amount of wilderness
recommended by the U.S. Forest Service.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday the veto
resulted from ``a variety of economic and environmental reasons,''
not politics.
   But Democrats and environmentalists said the move was political
manipulation, pointing out that nearly all wilderness bills signed
by Reagan have had more wilderness acreage than recommended by the
Forest Service.
   ``This whole veto is simply part of an effort to reduce the
possibility that there might be more Democrats in the U.S. Senate
next session,'' said Sherm Janke of Bozeman, chairman of the Montana
chapter of the Sierra Club. ``The real reason is to embarrass the
candidacies of those who have supported the wilderness legislation.''
   Some Democrats predicted a backlash, noting the issue of
wilderness preservation in Montana has been debated for a decade,
with this year's bill the first potential resolution.
   ``We're looking at a process that's been going on for 13 years,
and with a lack of a stroke of a pen, Ronald Reagan has just dumped
all that in a dumpster,'' said Ron Richards, a Melcher aide. ``I
would think there's going to be some resentment among some folks.''
   Democrats say releasing the 4.1 million acres is needed to
stabilize Montana's mining and timber industries, which are
recovering from recession in the early 1980s.
   Tom Daubert, press secretary for the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign in
Montana, expressed hope that the veto might convince more Montanans
to vote against Vice President and GOP presidential nominee George
Bush, who Democrats say advised Reagan on the veto.
   ``George Bush has added insult to injury here,'' Daubert said.
``We've had eight years of voodoo economics, and the icing on the
cake is prolonged instability in the mining and timber industries. I
think Montanans know that jobs are at stake here.''

   Democrats, while losing the White House by
almost landslide proportions, managed to boost their majority in the
Senate by at least one vote, and possibly two, depending on the
outcome of a cliff-hanger race in Florida.
   More than 24 hours after the polls opened for Tuesday's election,
there still was no winner in the race for the Senate seat in Florida
being vacated by Democrat Lawton Chiles.
   With only a portion of an estimated 100,000 absentee ballots
still uncounted among 4 million cast, Republican Rep. Connie Mack
overtook Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay and began building a slight
lead.
   A victory by Mack would leave Democrats with 55 of the 100 Senate
seats, up one from the 54-46 majority they held during the last
Congress. Should MacKay win, Democrats would hold a 56-44 edge.
   Democrats lost seats in Montana and Mississippi; Republican seats
changed parties in Connecticut, Nebraska, Nevada and Virginia.
   Even if Democrats were to lose in Florida and Connecticut, where
a recount is possible, they still would have the majority, which
carries with it the chairmanship of every committee and the right to
set the Senate's agenda.
   Some key lawmakers indicated that does not necessarily spell
trouble for President-elect George Bush.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, said he and other chairmen ``are prepared to work with
President Bush and do that straight up, no holds barred, and find
whether he means what he says when he says that he expects to have a
close relationship with the Senate and the House.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., predicted budget issues will dominate
the attention of the Senate and House next year. The new president's
oft-repeated opposition to higher taxes ``will be the big sticking
point'' in his dealings with Congress, Domenici added.
   Bush, who regularly reviled liberals during his campaign, will
find himself having to deal with some powerful Senate liberals who
easily won re-election.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Labor and Human
Resources Committee, took 66 percent of the vote in winning a fifth
six-year term. Sens. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., Banking Committee
chairman, and Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., who heads the Environment and
Public Works Committee, were re-elected with 61 percent each.
   Another prominent liberal, Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, one of
three senators vying to become majority leader in the new Congress,
won a second full term with 81 percent of the vote.
   In fact, landslides were the order of the day in the Senate
races. Twenty-two of the 33 seats up for grabs were won with at
least 57 percent of the vote.
   Charles Robb, son-in-law of former President Johnson, was elected
in Virginia, taking the seat given up by one-term Sen. Paul Trible,
a Republican. In Minnesota, a famous son, Hubert H. Humphrey III,
failed in his bid to unseat Republican David Durenberger, who has
served in the Senate since 1978.
   The most liberal Republican senator, Lowell Weicker of
Connecticut, who served 18 years, lost by 10,052 votes to Democrat
Joseph Lieberman, the state attorney general, who campaigned as a
backer of some initiatives of the Reagan administration. There had
been talk of a recount, but the final spread was not close enough to
warrant that.
   In Montana, Democratic Sen. John Melcher, first elected to
Congress in 1969, was upset by Conrad Burns, a former farm
broadcaster who accused Melcher of being too liberal. Burns becomes
the state's first GOP senator in 36 years.
   Veteran Republican Rep. Trent Lott defeated Democratic Rep. Wayne
Dowdy to win the seat being vacated by the Senate's most senior
member, Democrat John C. Stennis.
   Nevada voters retired Republican Sen. Chic Hecht after one term,
replacing him with Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan.
   In Nebraska, appointed Sen. David Karnes, a Republican, lost to
Bob Kerrey, a popular former governor and Vietnam war hero.
   While 10 new senators were elected Tuesday, there will be 11 new
faces when the Senate convenes in January. The governor of Indiana
will name a successor to Sen. Dan Quayle, who was elected vice
president.
   The other results:
   ARIZONA: Sen. Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat and one of the
wealthiest senators, won 61 percent of the vote and a third term.
   CALIFORNIA: First-term Republican Sen. Pete Wilson had an
easier-than-expected time defeating Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy.
   DELAWARE: Republican Sen. William V. Roth, co-author of the
Reagan-era tax cuts, easily won a fourth term.
   HAWAII: Democrat Spark Matsunaga rolled up 79 percent of the vote
in winning a third term.
   INDIANA: Republican Richard Lugar, a former chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, won a third term with a 68 percent
mandate.
   MARYLAND: Liberal Democrat Paul Sarbanes, first elected in 1976,
won a new term with 62 percent of the vote while his former law
school classmate, presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, was losing
this traditionally Democrtic state.
   MISSOURI: Republican John C. Danforth, who barely squeaked
through six years ago, won a third term with 68 percent of the vote.
   NEW JERSEY: Liberal Democrat Frank Lautenberg won a second term,
beating one of the Republicans' glamour candidates, Pete Dawkins, by
a 54-46 margin.
   NEW MEXICO: Democrat Jeff Bingaman was given a second term and 63
percent of the vote.
   NEW YORK: Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an expert on social
issues, won a third term with his biggest margin, 67 percent.
   OHIO: Howard Metzenbaum, the liberal Democrat most irksome to
Republicans, piled up 57 percent in defeating Cleveland Mayor George
Voinovich for a third term.
   PENNSYLVANIA: Republican John Heinz, who sometimes gets under the
skin of GOP leaders, took a 2-1 victory for a third term.
   RHODE ISLAND: Two-termer John Chafee, in line to be senior
Republican on the Environment committee, walked to an easy win.
   TENNESSEE: Democrat Jim Sasser, expected to become chairman of
the Budget Committee, approached a 2-1 victory margin in winning a
third six-year term.
   TEXAS: Lloyd Bentsen, who was swamped in the race for vice
president, had a million-vote victory in winning a fourth term.
   UTAH: Conservative Orrin Hatch, senior Republican on labor and
education matters, won 68 percent and a third term.
   VERMONT: Folksy Rep. James M. Jeffords easily won the seat being
given up by fellow Republican Robert T. Stafford.
   WASHINGTON: Republican Slade Gorton, unseated two years ago, won
a new term over liberal Democratic Rep. Mike Lowry.
   WEST VIRGINIA: Democrat Robert C. Byrd, first elected in 1958,
was re-elected with 65 percent of the vote. He is giving up the
majority leader's post to become president pro tem and
Appropriations chairman.
   WISCONSIN: Democrat Herbert Kohl spent $5 million of his own
money to spread his anti-establishment message and beat Republican
Susan Engeleiter by a 52-48 margin to succeed Democrat William
Proxmire, who is retiring.
   WYOMING: One of the most conservative Republicans, Malcolm
Wallop, won a second term by 1,300 votes, but Democrat John Vinich
is refusing to concede.

detail</NOTE>

   President Reagan exercised pocket vetoes
Wednesday on a bill designating 1.43 million acres of Forest Service
land in Montana as wilderness as well as on a measure establishing a
corporation to provide development capital to Indian businesses, the
White House announced.
   By exercising the pocket vetoes after Congress adjourned for the
year, there is no chance of overrides.
   In a statement concerning the Montana wilderness bill, Reagan
said, ``Enactment of the bill would injure the economy of Montana.
It could cost jobs and eliminate vast mineral development
opportunities. It also would reduce the flexibility the federal
government needs in managing the nation's natural heritage.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who co-sponsored the measure with
fellow Montana Democratic Sen. John Melcher, accused Reagan and Vice
President George Bush's presidential campaign of playing politics
with the bill.
   ``This is an affront to the people of Montana,'' Baucus said
Wednesday night in a statement read by press secretary Scott
Williams. ``This bill was vetoed for petty politics, and that's all.
... Clearly, the Bush campaign had a hand in this. The vice
president is still a member of the environmental wrecking crew.''
   The wilderness bill, passed by voice vote in both chambers of
Congress _ the Senate on Oct. 18 and the House on Oct. 20 _ would
have affected more than 6 million acres of Montana and was the
result of a compromise worked out among competing interests,
including conservationists and the timber and lumber industries.
   The measure designated about 1.43 million acres of Forest Service
land as wilderness; 360,400 acres as special management areas,
meaning recreation; and 320,700 acres as federal study areas. It
also released for non-wilderness uses _ such as timber harvesting
and mineral exploration _ another 4 million acres in Montana's 10
national forests.
   Reagan's veto was lauded by a northwest Montana logger, Bruce
Vincent, who called it ``a real victory for the citizens of Montana
and the families and communities who had a lot at stake.''
   Also supporting the veto was Conrad Burns, the Republican running
against Melcher for a Senate seat. Burns said the bill was vetoed
not for political reasons, but because it would cost jobs in Montana.
   ``If there were any politics involved in this, it was John
Melcher holding this bill up all year long and introducing it in the
11th hour, without holding hearings on it,'' Burns said in Montana.
   Melcher criticized Burns as the one playing politics, saying,
``We don't really need to make this political. We've had a hard
enough time passing a bill with all the competing interests in
Montana. To add another dimension with the White House ... well,
it's pretty tough.''
   Reagan said the administration's National Forest System Land and
Resource Management Plans for Montana already strike the appropriate
balance among competing economic, environmental and cultural
interests. The legislation, he said, ``would have severely disrupted
that balance.''
   In addition, the president said, the measure would have limited
the government's ability ``to obtain strategic and critical minerals
... necessary to supply military, industrial and essential civilian
needs during national defense emergencies....''
   Reagan argued that the federal government would have given up
revenue-producing land in favor of non-revenue-producing land, thus
increasing the federal deficit.
   The president said he was withholding his approval of the bill
creating the Indian Development Finance Corp. because it ``would
have created an expensive and unnecessary new bureaucracy and
duplicated currently existing programs.''
   The measure to provide development capital to Indian businesses
would not have addressed the underlying problems of economic
development for Indians, Reagan said, while placing ``the government
at risk of substantial financial loss.'' The bill ``does not provide
sufficient authority for government oversight of the financial
activities that could result in such loss.''
   Instead of creating a new institution, Reagan said, better use
should be made of existing sources of capital such as the Indian
Financing Act. He noted that he recently signed a bill which
increased the ceiling on loans and loan guarantees under that act.
   The section of the bill that transferred federal land in Southern
California to several bands of Southern California mission Indians
was unaffected by the pocket veto, Reagan said, because that also
was included in the omnibus Indian affairs bill that he approved
earlier.

   Democratic Sen. Max Baucus said he prepared
for a tough race, but ended up with a pushover, downing Republican
Allen Kolstad by a better than 2-to-1 margin.
   With 92 percent of precincts reporting, Baucus had 201,489
votes, or 70 percent. Kolstad, Montana's lieutenant governor, had
85,787, or 30 percent.
   Baucus returns to Washington for his third term. He said he
focused his campaign on convincing voters he was working to lessen
unemployment.
   Kolstad said he ran a hard, honest campaign but was outgunned by
Baucus' $3 million campaign fund. Kolstad also castigated Baucus
for running a deceptive campaign.
   Meanwhile, Montana voters on Tuesday defeated an initiative that
would have increased cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack. Voters
also re-elected the state's incumbent congressmen - one Democrat
and one Republican.

   It was just like old times when John Melcher
got together with agribusiness consultant Martin Sorkin for lunch at
the Watergate the other day.
   With one glaring exception.
   ``I told him that this time I would pay, and I did, indeed,
pay,'' confesses the 64-year-old Democrat, who last November lost
his bid for a third Senate term from Montana.
   Gone are the days when Melcher, an affable, white-haired
veterinarian known as ``Doc,'' could assume that the lunch tab would
be picked up by someone else.
   ``They used to call me,'' says the Democratic veteran of 12 years
in the House and seven in the Senate. ``Now I call them.''
   It was a close election. A turnaround of 7,000 votes would have
given Melcher a new, six-year lease on his Senate office.
   But Melcher ran into a GOP challenger, Conrad Burns, who was a
popular farm broadcaster at a time when his own base in the Grain
Belt was getting shaky after four years of drought and unpopular
policies blamed on Washington.
   Television ads featuring talking cows that boosted Melcher in
1982 proved a bust this time in a state anxious to shed its bucolic
image and spotlight an above-average education level as a means to
lure new, high-tech industries.
   Melcher also declares ruefully that he played into Republican
hands in dealing with a sensitive bill to preserve Montana
wilderness areas. He ended up losing support among both
conservations and the lumber industry.
   When the election was over, so was Melcher's congressional
career. His colleagues gave him a loyal sendoff.
   ``He has protected the rights of farmers in Montana and fought
for fairness in public power systems,'' declared Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., in a farewell to Melcher from the Senate floor.
   Fast Eddie and Abigail, a pair of cats that had romped through
his office at will in happier times, also had to go. An aide took
one and the senator himself bundled the other into his car and took
it to live in his suburban Maryland home.
   Then Melcher sat down to write letters and make phone calls on
behalf of aides already looking for new jobs. About half are now
employed while others are still hunting or have decided the time has
come to retire.
   Melcher himself is not planning to retire and there are two
reasons why.
   ``I have to earn some money,'' he says. ``I can live off my
retirement in Montana but if I want to stay here I've got to do
something.''
   Moving back to Montana, he says, would provide him with a more
pleasant place to live. But that would mean saying goodbye to the
issues that he has been campaigning for over almost two decades.
That is the second reason why he refuses to retire.
   Working off a borrowed desk in a downtown law firm, Melcher is
offering his services as a consultant on those issues. That is, as a
lobbyist.
   ``Well, call it what you may,'' he says, ``I think we have a
tendency to say consult but it's lobbying.''
   In that, Melcher is like scores of former lawmakers who stay on
in Washington after they retire or lose elections _ they move into
downtown suites and earn their living as hired guns in the
never-ending battle of Gucci Gulch.
   Senate rules designed to head off conflicts of interest bar
Melcher from contacting his former Senate colleagues about bills for
one year. But he is free to testify when their committees hold
hearings on bills. And he is free to ply the corridors of the
Agriculture Department on behalf of clients.
   Melcher already has one client, the Society for Animal Protection
Legislation.
   ``I have a profound interest in the well-being of primates that
are used in medical experiments,'' says Melcher. He says they
deserve decent surroundings and the company of their fellow
creatures.
   A broader plan Melcher is working on would establish a coalition
to fight potential cuts in the Food for Peace program, an
Agriculture Department export subsidy designed to give grain
companies an incentive to provide food for the hungry people of the
world.
   ``Those are the two items I'm working on now,'' says Melcher, who
pauses to reflect for a moment, then adds, ``I'm open to others.''

<HEAD>Longshot GOP Senate Candidates Profess Optimism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The politics of optimism is alive at the
Republican National Convention.
   But in the case of some GOP candidates for Senate seats held by
veteran Democrats, the odds against them are so long that some
might call it wishful thinking.
   ``I am not a sacrificial goat,'' said Massachusetts businessman
Joe Malone on Monday as he detailed his plans to defeat Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and score the ``upset of the century.''
   Kennedy has represented Massachusetts in the Senate for the last
quarter century and is considered virtually unbeatable.
   But Malone, who is of Italian descent despite his Irish surname,
was undeterred.
   ``I'm in it to win,'' Malone said at a news conference in which
16 Republican Senate candidates were introduced. ``I'm hearing
people saying that 25 years of Ted Kennedy are enough.''
   Jay Wolfe, a West Virginia businessman was equally optimistic.
   His opponent is Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate
Majority leader.
   Byrd hasn't been defeated since his first victory in 1958, 30
years ago.
   ``If you think I'm in this to lose, just watch on Nov. 8,''
Wolfe said.
   Republican Alan Keyes, a black former ambassador, was positively
defiant as he roared his optimism that he will unseat Sen. Paul S.
Sarbanes, D-Md., an entrenched Democrat in a normally Democratic
state.
   ``Start looking for a surprise,'' Keyes said. ``If any of you
people in the media want to get a head start on looking good in
November, start writing that Keyes is going to win. We are going to
prove Republicans can split any bloc, take any vote.
   ``That surprise is going to shake our state's one-party system
to its very roots.''
   Rep. Beau Boulter, R-Texas., announced his intention to defeat
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas., who under state law may run for
re-election while he seeks the vice presidency as the running mate
of Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen will fall off both horses he's trying to ride,''
Boulter said.
   Montana's Conrad Burns, a broadcast executive and a Yellowstone
County commissioner, said one reason he is trying to defeat Sen.
John Melcher, D-Mont., is that a Republican Senate candidate has
not carried Montana for a century.
   ``One Republican every 100 years is only fair,'' he said.
   Hawaii generally votes Democratic, but Maria M. Hustace, a
teacher, social worker and rancher, said she intends to beat the
trend and replace Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, a senator since
1976.
   She called Matsunaga the ``laziest member of the Senate,'' said
he is noted primarily ``for taking constituents to lunch'' and said
there is a rumor in the state that he is ill and will retire two
years after winning re-election.
   She immediately added: ``This is not to be a negative campaign.
It will be a positive campaign.''
   Earl Strinden, the executive vice president of the University of
North Dakota Alumni Association, is generally credited with having
a relatively good chance to end the 28-year Senate career of Sen.
Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.
   He assured reporters that ``we're not making age an issue.''
   Strinden immediately added: ``But every time a story is written,
it is immediately mentioned that my opponent is 80 years old.''
   At the news conference, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., chairman
of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, said that although
races are too close to call in 12 to 15 of the 32 seats states at
stake in November, the GOP has an excellent chance of recapturing
the Senate, now held by the Democrats, 54-46.
   ``We think it is in the realm of reason,'' Boschwitz said.

   The big winner Tuesday was the status quo. 

   Vice President George Bush succeeded his mentor, President Ronald Reagan. 
Of 408 incumbents seeking re-election to the House, 99% will be back. 
In the Senate, in the face of Mr. Bush's triumph over Democrat Michael Dukakis, a single incumbent Democrat was defeated while the Republicans lost three incumbents. 

   At the state level, the Democrats picked up one governorship -- they now outnumber the Republicans 28 to 22 -- and hung on to almost all of their legislative seats, even in the Deep South, where Mr. Bush crushed Mr. Dukakis. 

   It's the same old story. 
Republicans win the White House -- this was their fifth victory in the past six elections -- and Democrats hold on to the House and the Senate, most of the governorships and most of the state legislatures. 
Divided government is becoming an American institution. 

   One reason for Mr. Bush's decisive victory -- he piled up almost 54% of the popular vote and won 426 out of 538 electoral votes -- was a growing sense of optimism about the nation's economy, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News national voter poll. 
In the election-day poll, 28% of the respondents said they expected the economy to improve next year (and 16% thought it would get worse). 
This was a big jump from recent Journal/NBC News telephone polls, in which only about 19% felt optimistic about the economy. 

   Men, much more than women, believed in the good news about the economy, and that led to the so-called gender gap. 
Mr. Bush was supported by more than half of the men surveyed but less than half of the women. 

   Mr. Reagan won his great landslides with an outpouring of votes from young people. 
But Mr. Bush, despite reaching out to the "baby boomers" with his selection of 41-year-old Dan Quayle as his running mate, barely broke even with voters from 25 to 42 years old. 
Mr. Bush had a slight edge in the Journal/NBC poll. 
But among even younger voters -- those between 18 and 24 -- Mr. Dukakis held a narrow edge. 

   There was more encouraging news for the Democrats. 
According to the Journal/NBC poll, six out of 10 Democrats who voted for Mr. Reagan four years ago came home to vote for Mr. Dukakis. 
Nine out of 10 blacks stuck with the Democratic ticket (though it wasn't clear how high the black turnout was). 
Among Roman Catholics, Mr. Dukakis maintained a narrow lead, reversing the GOP advantage in recent elections. 
Among Jewish voters, he led better than two to one, while Mr. Bush led among Protestants. 

   By carrying 10 states and the District of Columbia, Mr. Dukakis did better than Walter Mondale in 1984 (one state and the District of Columbia) and President Jimmy Carter in 1980 (six states and the always reliable District of Columbia). 

   Frustrating to the Democrats is how tantalizingly close they came in 11 other states, where they picked up 46% or more of the vote. 
These states include California, Illinois, Connecticut, Michigan and Missouri. 
If Mr. Dukakis had won all 11 of these states, he would have eked out a narrow electoral-college victory. 

   In the Senate, where turnovers occur much more frequently than in the House and where the Republicans had control from 1980 to 1986, the Democrats actually gained one or two seats. 

   The big shocker was Connecticut, where three-term incumbent Lowell Weicker was upset by Democrat Joe Lieberman. 
Two other GOP incumbents -- Chic Hecht of Nevada and David Karnes of Nebraska -- were defeated by, respectively, Gov. Richard Bryan and former Gov. Robert Kerrey. 

   In another upset, Democrat John Melcher of Montana was defeated by former farm broadcaster Conrad Burns. 
Closest of all is the Florida Senate race between Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay and Republican Rep. Connie Mack, which may be decided by the absentee ballots that are still to be counted. 

   Republican hopes that Mr. Bush might have coattails never were realized in House races. 
In a swing district in New Jersey, for example, Democrats retained the seat held by the late Rep. James Howard. 
And in North Carolina's 11th district, the most competitive in the nation, Democratic Rep. James McClure Clarke beat Republican Charles Taylor to become the first incumbent to be returned from that district since 1978. 

   Democrats did well in contests for open House seats. 
They held onto a district in southeast Florida as Democrat Harry Johnston easily defeated Republican Ken Adams after a hard-fought campaign. 
Democrats also won House seats being given up by Republicans in Nebraska and Texas. 

   Most of the incumbents turned out on Tuesday were mired in scandal, notably House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain, a Rhode Island Democrat who had been investigated for allegedly accepting favors from a savings-and-loan lobbyist. 

   Georgia Republican Rep. Patrick Swindall, under indictment for his participation in a federal drug-money sting, was easily defeated by Democrat Ben Jones, who played the character "Cooter" in the television series "The Dukes of Hazzard." 

   Other House members touched by scandal were locked in tight races. 
Democrats Roy Dyson of Maryland and Bill Chappell of Florida, both implicated in the Pentagon procurement scandal, held razor-thin leads in races that could be decided by absentee ballots. 
Similarly, New York Republican Joseph DioGuardi, under fire for accepting $50,000 in allegedly illegal campaign contributions, was trailing his Democratic opponent in a close contest that could also turn on absentee voters. 

   The most important of these races was the defeat of Rep. St Germain, a 14-term veteran and the first House committee chairman to be turned out since 1980. 
Next in line for his job is the eccentric Rep. Henry Gonzalez of Texas, who has had little legislative impact in his 26-year House career. 
While he doesn't seem to get much respect among rank-and-file Democrats, he is likely to have the backing of House Speaker James Wright, a fellow Texan. 
In addition, Mr. Gonzalez's colleagues may find it difficult to reject one of the few senior Hispanic members of Congress. 

   Rep. Frank Annunzio, a rough-hewn Chicago machine pol who is the third-ranking committee member, is in frail health and isn't likely to seek the chairmanship. 
Others down the seniority line eyeing the post include Del. 
Walter Fauntroy of the District of Columbia and Reps. 
Stephen Neal of North Carolina, Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio and John LaFalce and Charles Schumer, both of New York. 

   In the 12 governors' races Tuesday, Democrats registered a net gain of one statehouse, increasing their margin over the Republicans to 28 to 22. 

   The big win for the Democrats took place in Indiana, where Evan Bayh, son of former U.S. Sen. Birch Bayh, defeated Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz, 53% to 47%. 
Mr. Bayh becomes the state's first Democratic governor in 20 years. 
His father was defeated for re-election to the Senate in 1980 by a young Republican, Dan Quayle. 

   In West Virginia, veteran Republican Gov. Arch Moore was denied an unprecedented fourth term in office when he was defeated by Democrat Gaston Caperton, an insurance executive. 

   In Montana, the Democratic candidate, former Gov. Thomas Judge, was upset by Republican state Sen. Stan Stephens, ending a long Democratic reign. 

   Democrats held their own in state legislative races too, where they already held a 4,445 to 2,923 lead over the Republicans. 
Maintaining this lead carries an important political advantage, as state legislatures prepare to reapportion congressional seats in 1991 following the 1990 census. 
Republicans have long contended that one reason the Democrats hang on to the House is that, decade after decade, they gerrymander the districts to their advantage. 

   Fragmented returns indicated the Republicans failed to make any gains in legislative seats, a turnaround for them in light of Republican gains of more than 300 seats in 1980 and again in 1984. 

   Democrats remain in control of both chambers in 28 states and control one of the two chambers in 13 more. 
The Republicans control both chambers in eight states. 
The Nebraska Legislature is unicameral and nonpartisan. 

   On Tuesday, the Democrats picked up control of the house in Montana and the senate in New Mexico and lost the house in Vermont. 
The Democrats lost 13 house seats in North Carolina, their biggest setback and possibly an omen of what is in store for them in the South, and lost some ground in Ohio and Michigan.

   Montana's race for governor, rocked by the
sudden withdrawal of the incumbent and the unexpected death of his
chief opponent, has left the state with a jumble of more candidates
than it has seen in 16 years.
   The remaining candidates in the June 7 primary include Montana's
attorney general, who is trying to overcome a drunken-driving
conviction; a former governor; a former state Supreme Court
justice; three past and present legislators; a drug
addict-turned-preacher and a tax protester.
   Democratic Gov. Ted Schwinden's decision last summer not to seek
a third term, saying he wanted concentrate more on his farm and
family, opened doors for candidates who had been unwilling to take
on the popular incumbent.
   Then, in early April, a plane crash killed the Republican
front-runner, Secretary of State Jim Waltermire, leaving his
supporters with a dilemma over which of the two remaining GOP
contenders to back.
   The common thread running through the eight-man campaign for
governor, the most crowded since 1972, has been economic
development, with the candidates offering ideas for infusing new
life into Montana's lackluster economy.
   The two Republican candidates, former state Sen. Stan Stephens
and state Rep. Cal Winslow, are vying for the chance to end the
Democratic Party's 20-year reign in the governor's chair.
   Both men have legislative backgrounds; Stephens has logged 16
years in the Senate and Winslow has served eight years in House.
But the similarities end there.
   Stephens, 58, has attracted support from the mainstream of the
state Republican Party, collecting support from former party
leaders and longtime GOP officeholders. He boasts of his experience
in Senate leadership positions and as a successful businessman from
northern Montana.
   Winslow, 38, has appealed to the younger elements of the
Republican Party, portraying himself as a conduit for attracting
new business to the state.
   The six Democratic candidates include three serious contenders.
   Thomas Judge, who was governor from 1973 to 1981, is attempting
a comeback after losing in the 1980 Democratic primary to
Schwinden. The 53-year-old investment adviser has built his
campaign on experience and an elaborate economic development plan.
   ``I won't need four years of on-the-job training,'' he has said,
boasting of the state's lucrative economy during his two terms as
governor.
   Attorney General Mike Greely, 48, overcame the stigma of a 1986
drunken-driving conviction to enter the race. He's called for a
more aggressive program for marketing Montana products elsewhere.
   Frank Morrison Jr., who resigned as a state Supreme Court
justice last year to run, has emerged as the candidate most
vehemently opposed to a retail sales tax.
   Seen as the most liberal of the Democrats, the 50-year-old
Morrison has political roots in Nebraska, where his father was a
three-term governor.
   The other Democratic candidates are Ted Neuman, a little-known
state senator and farmer; Emmett ``Curly'' Thornton, a traveling
evangelist who preaches on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse
based on his own past addictions; and Martin ``Red'' Beckman, a tax
protester and author.

   Here is a look at the closest races, starting with Senate
contests:
   NORTH CAROLINA - Harvey Gantt, the black former mayor of
Charlotte, is giving Sen. Jesse Helms the toughest race of his
career. Independent polls say the race is a dead heat. Gantt and
Helms differ on just about every issue. The conservative Republican
senator depicts his challenger as ``an extremist'' who supports
late-term abortions and those for sex-selection. Gantt depicts
Helms as an ideologue who votes against the interests of his state,
particularly on education and the environment.
   IOWA - Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin is battling Rep. Tom Tauke as
well as an Iowa tradition of not re-electing Democratic senators.
Polls show Harkin consistently in the lead but his edge is often
well within the margin of error. Abortion is a major issue with
Harkin pro-choice and Tauke firmly opposed to abortion. Iowa bucked
a national trend in the 1980s and became one of the strongest
growth areas for the Democrats, a factor that could help Harkin in
a close race.
   OREGON - Republican Sen. Mark Hatfield, bidding for a fifth
term, may be the best example of a complacent incumbent. Democratic
businessman Harry Lonsdale hammered away at Hatfield for months and
the senator ignored the challenge until a recent poll showed
Lonsdale had climbed to within 6 points of the incumbent. Another
race in which abortion is an issue; Hatfield is opposed while
Lonsdale is a supporter.
   HAWAII - Generally regarded as the best chance for the
Republicans to pick up a Democratic seat. Democrat Daniel Akaka was
appointed to the Senate last summer after Spark Matsunaga died. A
lackluster campaigner who held a safe House seat for seven terms,
Akaka is opposed by Republican Rep. Pat Saiki. Even Hawaii
Democrats conceded that Saiki is a dynamic campaigner and has a
strong chance to win in this heavily Democratic state.
   MASSACHUSETTS - Sen. John Kerry was considered a shoo-in for
re-election in this heavily Democratic state until the voters
expressed their rage in the Sept. 18 primary. Suddenly, independent
polls said the race between Kerry and his Republican challenger,
Jim Rappaport, was a dead heat. A wealthy businessman prepared to
spend millions on the race, Rappaport is concentrating on linking
Kerry to the highly unpopular outgoing governor, Dukakis.
   RHODE ISLAND - Democrat Claiborne Pell was elected to the Senate
in 1960, the year John F. Kennedy was elected president. His six
terms have given him the seniority to become chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee but have also made him vulnerable to a
challenge from 43-year-old Rep. Claudine Schneider. Politely but
firmly, Schneider suggests it is time for a younger person to take
Pell's seat. However, recent polls give Pell, 71, an 18-point lead.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE - GOP Rep. Bob Smith was heavily favored to
capture the Senate seat being vacated by fellow conservative Gordon
Humphrey. But former Sen. John Durkin has made a race of it and a
recent poll said Smith's 4-point lead was within the margin of
error.
   In other states, a large number of Senate contests looked
tempting to challengers but didn't seem to pan out. They include
Illinois where Democratic Sen. Paul Simon looks far ahead of
Republican Rep. Lynn Martin; Michigan where Democratic Sen. Carl
Levin is outdistancing Rep. Bill Schuette; Nebraska where
Democratic Sen. James Exon leads former Rep. Hal Daub; Kentucky
where Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell leads Harvey Sloane, and
Montana where Democratic Sen. Max Baucus is well ahead of Lt. Gov.
Allen Kolstad.
   Among the races for governor, these are getting the most
attention:
   CALIFORNIA - The battle between former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic nominee, and GOP Sen. Pete Wilson
is generally regarded as the most important contest in the nation.
California is likely to pick up seven new House seats in 1992 and
if Feinstein wins her party will have total control of how the
lines are drawn in the nation's most populous state. A victory for
Wilson gives the GOP an important role although the legislature
will remain Democratic. Wilson and Feinstein agree on more issues
than they disagree. Wilson's lead in the polls is well within the
margin of error.
   TEXAS - Republican millionaire Clayton Williams seemed well on
his way to victory over Democrat Ann Richards. But last week a new
poll said Richards had moved to within 5 points of Williams, whose
repeated verbal gaffes may be cutting into his support.
   FLORIDA - Martinez got into trouble over taxes early in his
first term and then found his hard-line anti-abortion stand had
moved out of favor with voters. Former Sen. Lawton Chiles got into
the race and led in most polls. Recently the margin has narrowed
and Martinez has a big edge in money.
   Florida is one of the six states where GOP governors are
threatened. The others are Alabama, where Gov. Guy Hunt is leading
teachers union official Paul Hubbert; Nebraska, where Gov. Kay Orr
is trailing businessman Ben Nelson; Kansas, where Gov. Mike Hayden
and state treasurer Joan Finney were in a dead heat; Maine, where
former Democratic Gov. Joseph Brennan held a narrow lead over Gov.
John R. McKernan; and Rhode Island where Gov. Edward DiPrete was
running far behind businessman Bruce Sundlun.
   The best bets for Republican pickups were in Vermont, Alaska,
Massachusetts, Oregon, and Ohio. Democratic governors are not
running in each of those states.
   In Oklahoma, GOP Gov. Henry Bellmon is not running and Democrats
hope for another gain.

   Dianne Feinstein, savoring success in California's Democratic
primary for governor, embarked on her fall campaign today against
well-financed GOP rival Pete Wilson. North Carolina Democrats picked
a black man to try to dethrone GOP Sen. Jesse Helms.
   In the longest count of a nine-state primary election, Alabama
Attorney General Don Siegelman squeezed into a runoff for the
Democratic nomination for governor with teacher lobbyist Paul
Hubbert after an all-night vote tally. The winner of the June 26
balloting will face GOP Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Seven senators gained nominations for new terms. GOP Sen. Thad
Cochran of Mississippi was arguably the biggest winner among them.
He faces no Democratic opposition in the fall and is thus assured of
a new term.
   Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Howell Heflin of Alabama
and Max Baucus of Montana easily overcame challenges within their
party, while Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa and Republicans Larry
Pressler of South Dakota and Pete Domenici of New Mexico were
unopposed.
   Incumbent governors in Iowa and South Dakota also were
renominated, along with Hunt in Alabama.
   In California, both Feinstein and Wilson, a second-term senator,
were kicking off their fall campaigns with breakfast appearances.
   ``Whoop it up tonight because this is your last victory party of
the 1990s,'' Wilson told the Democrats late Tuesday night after
breezing to his nomination.
   Democratic national chairman Ron Brown hailed Feinstein's success
and called the defeat of two Republican-backed redistricting
referenda a ``blowout for us.''
   ``They are going to have a money advantage,'' he said, referring
to Wilson's $3 million warchest. But, he added, ``issues are going
to prevail.''
   It was the California Democratic primary for governor that drew
most of the nationwide attention, both for the size of the state and
because the next governor will play a large role in determining
which party benefits from a census that may increase the state's
congressional delegation by a half-dozen seats.
   ``One mission completed, one to go,'' former San Francisco Mayor
Feinstein told supporters after securing her victory in a
hard-fought primary.
   With 99 percent of the precincts counted, she had 52 percent of
the vote, to 41 percent for Attorney General John Van de Kamp. Nine
other candidates split the remaining votes.
   Wilson breezed to an easy primary victory on the GOP side, and
said he'd keep the governor's office in Republican hands. He decided
to run for the job when GOP Gov. George Deukmejian declined to seek
a third term.
   Feinstein praised Van de Kamp in her victory speech and said the
fall campaign will be a choice between two Californias. ``One ...
with a declining quality of life, more crime, more traffic ... It is
content with caretaker government,'' she said. ``But our California
is a ... bold place.''
   In North Carolina, Helms congratulated Harvey Gantt on ``a
hard-earned victory.''
   ``How sweet it is,'' a jubilant Gantt told supporters after
dispatching prosecutor Mike Easley with 57 percent of the vote. His
victory made him the first of his race to win a Senate nomination
this century in North Carolina.
   ``I want to tell you that God is good, yes he is. It's a new day
in North Carolina,'' said Gantt, a former mayor of Charlotte.
   Alabama boasted the closest race of the night, a Democratic
primary to pick an opponent for incumbent GOP Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Education Association lobbyist Hubbert and Siegelman claimed the
right to face off in the runoff. With 96 percent of precincts
reporting, Hubbert was winning 32 percent of the vote and Siegelman
25 percent, followed by former Gov. Fob James with 22 percent and
Rep. Ronnie Flippo 17 percent. Two other candidates trailed.
   ``This is no place for the faint-hearted,'' said Flippo as the
long count continued.
   In an Iowa primary contest viewed as a referendum on abortion,
House Speaker Don Avenson claimed the Democratic nomination for
governor against GOP incumbent Terry Branstad, who opposes abortion.
Avenson, who favors abortion rights, won 40 percent of the vote to
defeat anti-abortion Democrat Tom Miller and three other contenders.
The National Organization for Women and the National Abortion Rights
ActionLeague, both of which endorsed Avenson, had feared he would
split the vote with other pro-choice contenders and permit Miller to
win.
   In addition to picking candidates for governor, Californians
voted to raise the state gasoline tax from 9 to 18 cents a gallon to
finance badly needed highway repair. Supporters said approval of the
measure would mark a symbolic end to the tax revolt that began in
1978 with passage of Proposition 13. With 98 percent of precincts
counted, the proposal was gaining 52 percent of the vote.
   The lines were drawn for what shape up as some of the nation's
most contested Senate elections in November, when Republicans seek
to cut into the current 55-45 Democratic advantage.
   Republicans count Harkin as among the most vulnerable Democrats,
and Rep. Tom Tauke has been campaigning against him even in advance
of formally claiming the GOP nomination Tuesday night.
   Republicans profess hope for knocking off two-term Democrat Max
Baucus in Montana, as well. The victor in a four-way GOP race was
Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad, who entered the race at the urging of the
national Republican leadership.
   In New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman was unopposed for the GOP
nomination to oppose Bradley. In Alabama, state Sen. Bill Cabannis
had no GOP opposition for the chance to challenge Heflin.
   GOP Sen. Domenici in New Mexico will face Democratic State Sen.
Tom Benavides, who was unopposed for his party's nomination.
   On the other side of the aisle, Democrats eye Pressler of South
Dakota as a potential victim for the fall. Ted Muenster, who had no
primary opposition, will run against him.
   In New Mexico's governor's race, former Gov. Bruce King won the
Democratic nomination in a bid to regain the office he's held for
eight years _ longer than anyone in state history. Former state Rep.
Frank Bond won the Republican nomination. Each man defeated three
rivals.

   There will be 11 new senators in the 101st
Congress that convenes Jan. 3, but they soon will find they aren't
all created equal.
   Republicans, who suffered a one-seat loss in this month's
elections and were left at a 55-45 disadvantage, can take slight
consolation as the pecking order of the new freshman class falls
into place when the Senate meets to elect its leadership next week.
   Atop the new seniority list is Republican Slade Gorton, who won
his comeback bid in Washington state. He takes that spot as the only
former senator in the incoming class.
   The top status will be at least a minimal boost for Gorton. It
entitles him to first pick of vacant office suites in the three
Senate office buildings and perhaps a few other perks, like a
coveted ``hideaway'' office in the Capitol.
   In the Senate Republican Conference, the party conclave that
makes committee assignments for GOP members, Gorton's prior service
also will give him a leg up on his freshman colleagues in the class
of '89.
   Last on the seniority list will be Montana Republican Conrad
Burns, the former farm broadcaster and Yellowstone County
Commissioner who ousted incumbent Democrat John Melcher.
   If Burns wants to know what to expect, he should ask North Dakota
Democrat Kent Conrad, who came in dead last in the seniority
sweepstakes two years ago and wound up with an office off a dank
stairwell in the farthest corner of the Hart Senate Office Building.
   Republicans also hold the next three positions on the seniority
list. All are lawmakers who are moving from the House to the Senate:
Trent Lott of Mississippi, Jim Jeffords of Vermont and Connie Mack
of Florida.
   Lott ranks first among the three because he is a 16-year House
veteran who rose to the party's No. 2 leadership position in the
chamber. Jeffords, after 14 years in the House, ranks next; and
Mack, a six-year House member, will be next in line of seniority.
   In the arcane scheme of things senatorial, politicians who have
been governors get less credit than House members. Being governor
isn't legislative experience, after all, and Congress tends to favor
its own.
   ``Things are different over there,'' Lott said recently, grinning
and shaking his head after trying to master the details of the
Senate seniority system.
   Three incoming freshman senators have been governors, all
Democrats: Virginia's Charles Robb, Robert Kerrey of Nebraska and
Richard Bryan of Nevada, who will be ranked in that order. Among
freshmen with the same qualifications, ties are broken by the
population of the state from which a senator is elected.
   Bringing up the rear of the seniority list are three new senators
who have no experience that earns credit in the Senate ranking
scheme. Again, they are ranked by the sizes of their states:
millionaire businessman Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat; Joseph
Lieberman, the Connecticut attorney general who defeated incumbent
Lowell Weicker; and Montana's Burns.
   This neat arrangement could all be fouled up, however, by the
eleventh new member of the Senate: the person appointed to replace
Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., who is leaving the chamber to be vice
president.
   Quayle has announced plans to resign sometime before the new
Congress convenes on Jan. 3, to enable GOP Indiana Gov. Robert Orr
to select a Republican. Otherwise, a new Democratic governor will
take over in Indiana and appoint a Democrat.
   Where that person will rank on the seniority list is a topic of
debate, and may have to be resolved by a vote in the Republican
conference. He or she could rank first, by virtue of being sworn in
earlier than the others; or it could be last, because Quayle doesn't
technically become unable to hold his Senate seat until Jan. 20,
Inauguration Day.
   In earlier times, an outgoing senator could give his successor a
seniority boost by resigning a few days early and letting the
replacement come into office ahead of others in the new group. But
the practice threatened to mushroom out of control, and has been
abandoned by both the GOP Conference and the Democratic Caucus, the
other party assembly that makes committee assignments.
   If it all seems rather complicated, take heart. Even Senate
insiders disagree on how the whole thing works. Said one Democratic
leadership official: ``It's worse than the family tree, folks.''

<TEXT>
   There is an unusual unanimity this year about
prospects for the Senate in Tuesday's balloting: Democrats will
remain in control, and may well increase their eight-seat advantage.
   ``The Democrats will hold onto 54 seats at a minimum, and I
believe have a very good opportunity to add,'' said Sen. John Kerry
of Massachusetts, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
   ``We realize it's still quite volatile out there,'' said Tom
Mason, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
``We could end up on Election Day minus two. But we could just as
easily be plus two or better.''
   One reason little change is expected is that, unlike some past
presidential elections, there has been no overriding national theme
dictated by the top of the ticket, the kind of compelling issue that
would propel voters to seek massive changes.
   Rather, polls have show a general contentment with the status
quo, and that works to the benefit of incumbents.
   That advantage extends to the House, where very little movement
is expected in the Democrats' 255-177 majority.
   ``There isn't the thematic difference'' that has pervaded
presidential contests in the past, Mason said. ``President Reagan
said it best: We are the change. It's not as clear a mandate as in
1980, when there was such a screaming need for change.''
   That was the year Republicans rode Reagan's coattails to a
12-seat pickup and control of the Senate for the first time in a
quarter-century. In 1986, an eight-seat gain enabled Democrats to
retake control.
   This time, Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis
have been criticized for running a race devoid of issues, devoted
mostly to personal attacks and distortions of each other's records.
   So issues in this year's Senate campaign have been largely drawn
from a list of topics that Democrats claim as their own, although
they have been used by candidates of both parties: the environment,
education, Social Security, health care and ``family issues'' like
child care.
   Also prominent in Senate stump speeches and advertising have been
the problems of drugs and crime, which register near the top of
Americans' concerns in national polls.
   Most Senate incumbents of both parties appeared likely to win
re-election on Tuesday, but there were several prominent exceptions.
   Analysts said Republican Sen. David Karnes, who was appointed in
1987 to fill an unexpired Nebraska Senate term, was the most likely
to be ousted. Democratic former Gov. Bob Kerrey, a popular figure
with a Hollywood-like appeal in the state, held a heavy lead in
polls.
   Three other incumbents _ two Republicans and one Democrat _ also
faced difficult battles for survival.
   In Nevada, GOP Sen. Chic Hecht, who for months had been
considered the most vulnerable Republican incumbent, has fought back
to a dead heat with his challenger, Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan. A
political action committee of import car dealers was pouring
$382,000 into mass mailings and TV spots for Hecht, and Hecht was
running ads linking himself to Bush and Bryan to Dukakis.
   Sen. Lowell Weicker, the veteran maverick Republican from
Connecticut, has resorted to his own negative ads attacking
challenger Joseph Lieberman, the state's Democratic attorney
general. The race is the most complex political matchup in the
country. Lieberman has sought to outflank Weicker by portraying him
as aloof from Connecticut concerns, and has attracted support from
all parts of the political spectrum.
   Republicans hungry for an upset were pointing to Montana, where
they claimed to have Democratic incumbent John Melcher on the run.
His GOP rival, Yellowstone County Commissioner Conrad Burns, was
running positive biographical ads in the closing days of the
campaign, while Melcher was airing man-in-the-street testimonials
advising against sending ``a greenhorn'' to Washington.
   Six open seats, where no incumbent was seeking re-election, were
the other major battleground. Democratic former Virginia Gov.
Charles Robb appeared poised to claim a formerly Republican seat,
and Rep. James Jeffords, R-Vt., was likely to enter the Senate from
his state. Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., also seemed to be holding
firmly to a polling lead in his bid to replace retiring Democratic
Sen. John Stennis.
   But in three other open seats, the outcome was up for grabs.
   Former Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican, picked up a spate of
last-minute newspaper endorsements in his bid to keep Washington's
Senate seat in GOP hands, but polls showed Democratic rival Rep.
Mike Lowry in a dead heat.
   Florida promised a similar cliffhanger, with Democratic Rep.
Buddy MacKay seeking to beat out Republican Rep. Connie Mack in a
state where Bush held a heavy advantage. Like Hecht, Mack was
receiving substantial last-minute backing from the import car
dealers PAC.
   In Wisconsin, Democrat Herb Kohl, a millionaire who owns the
Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, was holding onto a narrowing lead
in his effort to retain the seat of retiring Sen. William Proxmire
for the Democrats. Republican state Senate minority leader Susan
Engeleiter was pressing hard, and both Bush and Reagan campaigned
for her in the state.

   Democrats were favored to retake the governor's office in Indiana
and West Virginia and were locked in tighter-than-ever races with
GOP incumbents in Rhode Island and Utah today as voters in 12 states
cast ballots for their top job.
   Montana also held the possibility that the governor's office
might change party hands, with the candidates in a dead heat to
succeed Democrat Ted Schwinden.
   Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter, overcoming the stigma of a record $166
million tax increase in 1987, erased an early, 30-point deficit in
the polls to draw even with Democrat Ted Wilson. In Rhode Island,
Bruce Sundlun's allegations of unethical conduct lifted him into a
too-close-to-call race against Gov. Edward DiPrete.
   Democrats hold 27 of the 50 governorships. Nine incumbents _ six
Republicans and three Democrats _ are on the ballot. Republican
Robert Orr of Indiana is barred by law from a third term; Schwinden
and New Hampshire Republican John Sununu are retiring.
   If Massachussetts' Michael Dukakis is elected president, Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy, also a Democrat, will serve out his gubernatorial
term. In Nevada, Lt. Gov. Bob Miller will succeed fellow Democrat
Dick Bryan if Bryan is elected to the Senate.
   Other states electing governors are Delaware, Missouri, North
Dakota, Vermont and Washington.
   Evan Bayh, son of former U.S. Sen. Birch E. Bayh, was favored to
become Indiana's first Democratic governor office in 20 years,
although his lead appeared to be slipping. The 32-year-old Indiana
secretary of state would also be the youngest U.S. governor in
office.
   An Indianapolis Star poll published Oct. 30 gave him a 54-40 lead
over Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz. But a statewide poll by the
Public Opinion Laboratory at Indiana University-Purdue University at
Indianapolis and released Monday showed likely voters splitting 50.1
percent for Bayh to 46.3 for Mutz. The GOP hoped a big Bush-Quayle
victory in Sen. Dan Quayle's home state would help pull Mutz
through. It was Quayle who ousted the elder Bayh from the Senate in
1980.
   In West Virginia, Republican Arch Moore, seeking an unprecedented
fourth term, fought for his political life. His opponent, Democrat
Gaston Caperton, an insurance executive and political novice, has
called the election a referendum on the economy in West Virginia,
which has one of the nation's highest unemployment rates and had to
borrow $80 million from its investments this year to pay its bills
because of a slump in coal and other industries.
   A poll Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 gave Caperton a 51-35 lead, unchanged
from mid-October, but Moore is a 65-year-old political warhorse who
has made a career overcoming the odds in predominantly Democratic
West Virginia.
   ``People know Arch Moore hasn't delivered and that I will
deliver,'' Caperton said.
   In Rhode Island, Sundlun, a communications executive who lost to
DiPrete by a landslide in 1986, robbed the governor of an early,
commanding lead by raising questions about DiPrete's private
business deals, alleged favoritism in the awarding of state
contracts and the hiring of the ex-wife of a reputed mobster for a
state job. DiPrete has stressed the state's economic recovery.
   Two TV station polls last week had the candidates one point apart.
   The Bangerter campaign in Utah also counted on a strong showing
by Vice President George Bush. The governor's comeback largely
coincided with Bush's surge since the Republican National Convention
in August. The outcome may also hinge on whether independent Merrill
Cook, who ran on a tax-limitation platform, can hold the support of
conservatives.
   Two polls issued Sunday had Wilson, the former mayor of Salt Lake
City, 2 points ahead of Bangerter with 37 percent, and even with the
governor at 36 percent. Cook had 26 percent and 24 percent.
   ``It's always scary to see those polls drop, but 15 months ago,
when we led by 30, we knew there was no way we could win by more
than 4 points,'' said Wilson campaign manager Rob Jolley.
   Montana's Thomas Judge, Democratic governor from 1973 to 1981,
and Republican state Sen. Stan Stephens claimed late momentum in a
campaign over how to revive the state's economy. A poll late last
month indicated a dead heat.
   Neither side expected much of a coattail effect from the White
House race; ticket-splitting Montana has sided with the GOP
presidential winner for 20 years, but its governor, both senators
and one of two congressmen are Democrats.
   In other races:
   DELAWARE _ Republican Gov. Michael N. Castle was expected to roll
toward an overwhelming victory against Democrat Jacob Kreshtool, a
retired attorney and political newcomer.
   MISSOURI _ Republican Gov. John Ashcroft headed for an expected
landslide against Democratic state Rep. Betty Hearnes, wife of a
former governor.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Republican Judd Gregg, a congressman and son of a
former governor, was favored over Paul McEachern, a fierce opponent
of the Seabrook nuclear plant who nearly rode the issue into the
Statehouse two years ago.
   NORTH CAROLINA _ Republican Gov. Jim Martin led Lt. Gov. Bob
Jordan, a Democrat.
   NORTH DAKOTA _ Gov. George Sinner held a commanding lead in the
polls over Republican Leon Mallberg, a businessman making his first
run for statewide office.
   VERMONT _ Democrat Madeleine Kunin, the state's first woman
governor, was favored for a third term against House GOP Leader
Michael Bernhardt.
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic Gov. Booth Gardner headed for an expected
landslide over Republican state Rep. Bob Williams.

<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz has
increased his lead over challenger Paul Wellstone, according to a
poll published Saturday.
   The Pioneer Press-WCCO poll indicated that 49 percent of 760
likely voters polled last week preferred Boschwitz, while 40
percent favored Wellstone. Eleven percent were undecided, and the
margin of error was 4 percentage points.
   A Star Tribune-KSTP-TV Minnesota Poll published Oct. 24 showed a
closer race. That poll found that 48 percent of those questioned
chose Boschwitz compared with 45 percent for Wellstone. The margin
of error was 4 percentage points.
   Boschwitz has felt the backlash of voter discontent in the wake
of problems that plagued Republican gubernatorial hopeful Jon
Grunseth. Grunseth withdrew from the race after allegations that he
swam nude with teen-age girls in 1981.
   Democrat Wellstone began the campaign as a little-known college
professor and activist, but benefited from the Grunseth fallout.
Wellstone has tried to exploit a nationwide anti-incumbent mood.
   Boschwitz has labeled Wellstone a big-spending liberal whose
proposals would cost the taxpayers an additional $600 billion a
year and derail federal budget-balancing efforts.

   Republican Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon
doesn't want to be a part of Democratic Sen. Max Baucus'
re-election campaign.
   Packwood is being featured in Baucus commercials that defend his
voting record against allegations from GOP challenger Allen
Kolstad, the state's lieutenant governor.
   The ad is in response to one by Kolstad that alleged Baucus
voted for a $50 million tax break for Phillips Petroleum in 1986.
Packwood, former chairman of the Senate Taxation Committee, is
quoted as saying Kolstad is wrong and that Baucus wasn't
responsible for including the tax break in a bill.
   Elaine Franklin, Packwood's chief of staff, said she called
Baucus' campaign manager after seeing the ad Friday ``and said it
would be our preference that Sen. Packwood is not in this race.''
   Paul Risley, Baucus campaign spokesman, said the ad would
continue. And Kolstad spokesman Stuart Brown said Kolstad's
original ad also would continue.
   Franklin said she didn't know Packwood's letter about Kolstad's
allegations would be used in a TV commercial. However, she said

   Republican gubernatorial candidate George

   ``Our own internal polls for the same period of time show us
dead even,'' she said.
   The Ohio Poll is jointly sponsored by the Dayton Daily News, The

the university's Institute for Policy Research.
   Results showed Voinovich was supported by 52.3 percent of the

<HEAD>Utah, Montana Governors Sworn In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two governors began work today, an incumbent in Utah and a
Republican in Montana who was the first GOP candidate to win that
state's highest office in 20 years.
   In Salt Lake City, Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter, who barely
survived a three-way gubernatorial election in November, began his
second term as the state's 13th governor. Val Oveson, the incumbent
lieutenant governor also was sworn in during Monday's ceremony.
   Stan Stephens, a former Montana state senator who moved to the
state from Canada 40 years ago to harvest wheat, took his oath in
Helena after Allen Kolstad, a farmer-businessman from Chester and
also a former state senator, was sworn in as lieutenant governor.
   Bangerter, who trailed Democrat Ted Wilson by more than 30
percentage points in the polls this past summer, rallied to claim a
40-38 percent victory over Wilson. Independent Merrill Cook had 22
percent.
   Bangerter, 55, said he followed the advice of the late British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill: ``Never give in, never give in,
never, never give in, except to convictions of honor or good sense.''
   Bangerter was sworn in before a crowd of 1,400 at the Capitol
Rotunda.
   Stephens, 59, told the inaugural audience at the Capitol in
Helena that he assumes the job of chief executive with a ``deep
sense of responsibility'' knowing of the troubles that beset Montana.
   ``The Montana economy has been depressed,'' Stephens said. ``We
have endured the ravages of drought and forest fires and of being
perceived negatively on the barometric scales of business and
commerce.
   ``Montana's spirit has been bruised, but never broken,'' he said.
   Stephens, who portrayed himself as a harbinger of change during
his two-year campaign, pledged that change will be for the better.

   A hotly contested race for governor topped
Montana's ballot, as former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge sought a
comeback and Republican Stan Stephens battled to reclaim the post
for his party for the first time in 20 years.
   Democratic Sen. John Melcher was favored to win a third term by
turning back a challenge from Republican Conrad Burns, a county
commissioner and relative newcomer to Montana politics.
   In the presidential race for Montana's four electoral votes,
polls showed Republican George Bush headed into the final week of
the campaign leading Democrat Michael Dukakis by 15 percentage
points.
   The race to succeed retiring Gov. Ted Schwinden was dominated by
debate over how to revive the state's economy. Stephens, a former
state senator, headed toward the election running even with Judge,
who served as governor from 1973-81, until Schwinden upset him in a

percent of the vote.
   Both Republican Rep. Ron Marlenee and Democratic Rep. Pat

<HEAD>Senate Republicans on the Offensive in 1990 Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The numbers say this election year should be a
good one for Democrats to strengthen their hold on the Senate. But
since candidates and not numbers win elections, it's the GOP that's
on the offensive.
   ``We have a better crop of challengers this time than we've ever
had,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee.
   ``I'd be happy and pleased and I think we would say we've done a
good job if we stay the same'' in Democratic strength, said Sen.
John Breaux, D-La., chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
   By tradition, an off-year election bodes well for the party that
doesn't control the White House. And from a distance, it looks like
this one should follow the pattern.
   Democrats have a 55-45 majority in the Senate, but the
Republicans have more seats at risk. Of the 34 Senate seats on the
line, the GOP must defend 18 and the Democrats 16.
   Three incumbent Republicans are retiring, heightening the
apparent Democratic opportunity.
   But seven months before the election, it appears the Democrats
have failed to recruit many top-flight candidates while the GOP has
succeeded. That gives Republicans hope they can narrow the
Democrats' majority this year and perhaps reclaim control of the
Senate in 1992.
   In all three cases where Republican senators are stepping down
this year, GOP House members have stepped forward as candidates and
are the early front-runners.
   In Colorado, where Sen. Bill Armstrong is retiring, Rep. Hank
Brown hopes to step into the breach. Popular Rep. Robert Smith is
running for the seat being vacated by Sen. Gordon Humphrey in New
Hampshire. And in Idaho, Rep. Larry Craig is seeking to succeed
Sen. James A. McClure.
   Four other House Republicans are taking the far riskier leap
into races against incumbent Democrats _ creating potentially the
hottest Senate contests in the nation.
   The Iowa Senate campaign already is steaming as Republican Rep.
Tom Tauke challenges incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin. In Illinois,
GOP Rep. Lynn Martin has had help from President Bush in her
challenge against Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.
   In Rhode Island, Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider is trying to
unseat a popular but aging Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell. And in
Michigan, Republican Rep. Bill Schuette is in a primary fight
against conservative activist Clark Durant for the right to
challenge Democratic Sen. Carl Levin.
   Another close race is shaping up in Nebraska, where former
Republican Rep. Hal Daub, who failed in a Senate bid two years ago,
is challenging Democratic incumbent Sen. J. James Exon. Another
Democratic incumbent that Republicans consider vulnerable is Sen.
Max Baucus of Montana. The list of Republican challengers there
includes Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad.
   Meanwhile, no Republican senators who are seeking re-election
appear to be in serious trouble so far. Poll results suggest that
GOP Sens. Jesse Helms in North Carolina and Mitch McConnell in
Kentucky are vulnerable, but potential Democratic challengers still
are fighting among themselves in both states.
   Although some House Democrats flirted with entering Senate
races, none did. And in several cases, popular present and former
state office holders passed up seemingly good opportunities to move
to Washington.
   The Democrats tried hard to recruit candidates ``but their
efforts just seemed to come up a little bit short,'' said political
analyst Charles Cook. Finding a good Senate candidate is mostly
luck of the draw and ``this time, the Republicans got all the
breaks,'' he said.
   The result is apparent security for the GOP _ even a slim chance
of taking control of the Senate if they can sweep all of the close
races _ while ``Democrats have too many seats close to the edge,''
Cook said.
   A 50-50 split would give Republicans control, because the
Republican vice president would break tie votes.
   If the Republicans trimmed the Democratic majority to less than
two or three seats after this election, the GOP would be in a good
position to retake the Senate in 1992 when 20 Democrats and only 14
Republicans face re-election.
   There is talk of two more races being added to the 34 scheduled
this fall.
   Hawaii Democrat Spark Matsunaga has cancer and must be brought
into the Senate chamber by wheelchair to vote. Although he has not
indicated he will resign, potential successors have been quietly
eyeing his seat.
   A Senate Ethics Committee investigation of Sen. Dave
Durenberger's personal finances has led to speculation that the
Minnesota Republican might resign if serious charges were brought.
   Breaux, who leads the Senate Democrats' campaign committee, said
his lack of Senate challengers from the House isn't the handicap
the Washington cognoscenti make it out to be.
   ``Who's to say that House members are better candidates than
people who are not from Washington and can run against the mistakes
and the problems that Washington is in fact responsible for?'' he
asked.
   Breaux acknowledged, though, that he's hoping for some upsets.
One race where he sees potential is Democratic businessman Ted
Muenster's bid to oust Republican Sen. Larry Pressler in South
Dakota.
   The Democratic drive to hold the line this year is fueled by the
specter of 1992.
   ``I'm running down the track looking over my left shoulder and
then I turn and look over my right shoulder,'' said Breaux, who
faces re-election himself in two years.
   Neither Breaux nor Nickles saw an overriding national theme in
this year's races.
   Breaux said the abortion issue could help Democrats in several
pro-choice states where the Republican candidate has an
anti-abortion stance, as is the case in Iowa and Michigan. It also
could give Democrats an upset, perhaps in New Hampshire or Oregon,
where anti-abortion incumbent Mark O. Hatfield is being challenged
by Democratic businessman Harry Lansdale.
   Nickles discounts abortion's role in the next election.
Republican gubernatorial losses in New Jersey and Virginia last
fall may have been due to anti-abortion stands because
``Republicans did a poor job responding,'' and that won't happen
this time, he said.

<HEAD>GOP Still Sees Potential for Senate Gains in November Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican hopes of slashing the Democrats'
55-45 Senate majority hinge on the potential for a voter earthquake
to shake things up in the final weeks before Election Day.
   Republicans so far have been unable to turn the electorate
against a swath of Democratic incumbents whom the GOP identified
earlier this year as potentially vulnerable.
   All but one Democratic incumbent is leading in the polls. But
Democrats concede the Republican claim that voters have been
distracted by the crisis in the Persian Gulf and are just starting
to focus on the races.
   ``Six weeks out, and voters are only now paying attention,''
said Anita Dunn, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. ``I don't think any lead right now is very meaningful.''
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, recalled that in 1980 and 1986, the last two
years where the Senate changed parties, ``the races really didn't
close until the last three weeks.''
   The GOP is ``certainly within striking distance'' in many races
this year, even if the polls don't always show it, he said. The
list includes Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, Hawaii, Nebraska, Montana
and Rhode Island.
   If Republicans get most of the breaks, which Nickles says is
unlikely, they could pick up the five seats needed to wrest control
from the Democrats.
   But the GOP clearly would be satisfied with gaining just two or
three seats, which would make the Democrats especially vulnerable
in 1992, when many who barely won office in 1986 are up for
re-election for the first time.
   Currently, Hawaii Sen. Daniel Akaka is the only incumbent
Democrat who is behind in the polls, and not by much. Akaka was
appointed to the Senate earlier this year to fill the seat of the
late Spark Matsunaga.
   Akaka is running against his former House colleague, Republican
Rep. Pat Saiki.
   Iowa has been a brawl for months between Democratic Sen. Tom
Harkin and Republican Rep. Tom Tauke. Republicans say Tauke is
whittling away at Harkin's lead, but Democrats say Tauke was hurt
by the disclosure that he accepted a congressional pay raise he had
campaigned against. Tauke said he took the money, but later donated
it to charity.
   The GOP's heavy recruitment of candidates from the House of
Representatives hasn't worked so well in other cases.
   Michigan, Illinois and Rhode Island are states where the
Democratic incumbents have held tenaciously to leads in polls
despite tough opposition from GOP House members.
   In Michigan, incumbent Democrat Carl Levin was preferred by
voters 2-1 over Rep. Bill Schuette in a recent poll, despite an
aggressive television campaign by the Republican challenger.
   President Bush interceded to get Illinois Rep. Lynn Martin the
GOP nomination to challenge Sen. Paul Simon, but the Democrat has
maintained a solid lead in the polls.
   Rhode Island Rep. Claudine Schneider has proven statewide appeal
in that tiny state. But she's still struggling to chip away at the
popularity of incumbent Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell.
   Earlier this year, Republicans considered Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., as the most vulnerable of their targets. But Baucus has
climbed in the polls in recent weeks to a solid 25-point lead over
conservative Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad.
   While disappointed that more hasn't happened in those races, the
GOP sees new opportunity in Massachusetts, where voters in the
primary threw out the Democratic Party slate for state officers.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., has been indirectly hurt. Previously
considered safe, Kerry suddenly is just barely ahead of challenger
Rappaport in the polls. Rappaport already has run a television ad
linking Kerry with unpopular Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   But Republicans may have trouble using the ``throw the rascals
out'' tactic in many of the states where they have been most
hopeful, since they recruited so many sitting or former members of
Congress as candidates.
   Democrats are confident Kerry will hold his seat, just as
Republicans are confident Jesse Helms of North Carolina will win,
even though he's in a dead heat in the polls with former Charlotte
mayor Harvey Gantt.
   Both sides point to longshot chances against the others'
incumbents in other states, and Democrats are behind but still hope
to grab one or more of the three seats where Republican incumbents
are retiring in Colorado, Idaho and New Hampshire.
   But perhaps the most unusual race of the year is one where both
parties concede the outcome - that Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
will win re-election.
   The big question is whether Johnston can capture 50 percent of
the vote in Louisiana's Oct. 6 open primary and avoid a runoff in
November with the sure second-place finisher - former Ku Klux
Klansman David Duke.
   Republicans are so worried that Duke will represent their party
on the ticket that they have virtually abandoned the campaign of
their chosen candidate, Ben Bagert, in hopes Johnston can avoid a
runoff.

   Rival Democrats Harvey Gantt and Mike
Easley, entering the closing hours of their Senate runoff primary,
are concentrating their fire on Republican Sen. Jesse Helms. But
across the continent, California Democrats are slamming each other.
   North Carolina and California are among nine states holding
primaries on Tuesday, the busiest day so far of the 1990 election
year. The other states are Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New
Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.
   As they entered the final 24 hours before voters cast their
ballots, candidates checked opinion polls, unleashed their final
television ads and tried to stir support with a closing round of
personal appearances.
   Two new polls of potential voter sentiment in the bitterly fought
race for the Democratic nomination for governor of California showed
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein maintaining a lead over
state Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
   The Los Angeles Times poll said Feinstein had a 13-point lead _ a
gain of two points over a similar survey early in May. The poll gave
the former mayor 42 percent and Van de Kamp 29 percent. There were
29 percent still undecided or supporting one of the nine minor
candidates on the Democratic primary ballot.
   Mervin Field's California Poll, which gave Feinstein a slim 3
percent lead earlier this month, reported that margin had opened up
to 8 points over Van de Kamp, 42-34, in polling that concluded
Sunday. New polls also were out in Iowa and New Mexico.
   In North Carolina, Easley accused Helms of attacking him with
``personal character assassinations'' in radio ads. ``They are
personal and very negative,'' the Brunswick County prosecutor told
supporters Sunday.
   One Helms ad accuses Easley of waffling on the issues and another
suggests that he plea-bargained a drug case involving a campaign
contributor's son who was caught with nearly a pound of cocaine.
   Easley said he was countering with ads saying, ``This year North
Carolina must say no to Jesse Helms and mudslinging.''
   ``I think Charlotte people believed long before anyone else that
we are going to bring Jesse Helms home,'' Gantt told supporters
Sunday night in Charlotte, N.C.
   Abortion was the issue of the day in California where Sen. Pete
Wilson had only token opposition for the GOP nomination to succeed
fellow Republican George Deukmejian in the governor's office.
Deukmejian declined to seek a third term.
   Van de Kamp appeared on the steps of the Los Angeles County
Courthouse with Norma McCorvey, the ``Jane Roe'' of the landmark
U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade abortion rights decision.
   ``I have no criticism of Mrs. Feinstein's record (on abortion),''
McCorvey said. ``But I believe John Van de Kamp is the candidate who
will do the most to protect a woman's right to choose. I trust John
Van de Kamp.''
   Feinstein also stressed her long support of abortion rights,
telling fund-raisers in West Hollywood that ``I believe that a woman
is best protected by another woman who believes in the right to
choose.''
   The two candidates were running television commercials harshly
attacking each other.
   Van de Kamp's commercials described Feinstein as a ``Republican
in Democratic clothing,'' while the former mayor's ads accused the
attorney general of refusing to ``talk about his own record.''
   Abortion also has been a major issue in Iowa's Democratic primary
for governor. The National Abortion Rights Action League endorsed
Iowa House speaker Don Avenson in a move designed to help him
against anti-abortion rival Tom Miller, the state attorney general.
Republican Gov. Terry Branstad is an abortion opponent.
   A new poll, published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, said
Avenson had moved into the lead with support from 32 percent of
those surveyed, compared with 25 percent for Miller. Former banker
John Chrystal was at 19 percent, and 20 percent said they were
undecided.
   The newspaper said the sampling was among 629 likely primary
voters and had a margin of error of 3.9 percent.
   ``It's breaking our way, obviously,'' said Avenson.
   In New Mexico, large fields were seeking the gubernatorial
nomination in both parties. Incumbent GOP Gov. Garrey Carruthers was
ineligible to seek re-election, but the person elected to succeed
him will be the first New Mexico governor allowed to serve two
successive terms.
   A new poll published Sunday in the Albuquerque Journal said state
Senate Minority Leader Les Houston and former legislator Frank Bond
each had the support of 29.2 percent of the registered Republicans
surveyed.
   On the Democratic side, former Gov. Bruce King had the backing of
42.7 percent, while state Attorney General Paul Bardacke was
supported by 31.5 percent.
   The poll was conducted for the Journal by Research and Polling
Inc. of Albuquerque, which surveyed 664 registered Democrats and 402
registered Republicans. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percent for the Democrats and 5 percent for the Republicans.
   A large field was battling in Alabama for the Democratic
nomination to oppose GOP Gov. Guy Hunt, the first Republican to hold
that office since the post-Civil War Reconstruction period.
   Among the Democratic contenders was former Gov. Fob James who was
taped recently by a public television crew while telling a
Republican Party official that ``there ain't but one damn Goldwater
Republican in this race, and you know who that is.''
   An aide to James, a former Republican, said the remark was ``a
joke more than anything.''
   In Montana, four Republicans were vying for the nomination to
oppose Democratic Sen. Max Baucus.
   In Mississippi, Republican Sen. Thad Cochran was as good as
re-elected to a third term. He had no primary opposition and no
Democrat has filed to run against him in the fall.
   Democratic Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Howell Heflin of
Alabama had only token primary opposition. The same was true of
Republican Sens. Larry Pressler of South Dakota and Pete Domenici of
New Mexico.
   Gantt and Easley worked hard to get out their core supporters.
   ``There are a lot of voters out there, especially in the East,
that we ought to be able to pick up,'' Easley said while campaigning
in the eastern part of the state. ``If we have a big turnout in the
East, Mike Easley will win the runoff. If we don't it'll be real
close.''
   Gantt sought votes in the same region over the weekend,
especially in the northeast, which has a high percentage of black
voters who were critical in the May 8 primary when the former mayor
of Charlotte led a six-man field.
   But Gantt fell short of the 40 percent threshold he needed to
avoid a runoff and become the first black candidate for statewide
office in North Carolina this century.

<LEADPARA>  After a lifetime on the wind-scraped eastern front of the Continental Divide,
Ed and Eileen Grady finally have given in to the miseries of Montana cattle
ranching: endless winters, drought, depressed beef prices and, more recently,
an invasion of city slickers.;   Hanging a for-sale sign on their 10,000-acre
ranch was the hardest thing Eileen Grady says she has ever done. But what
makes her particularly angry is the thought of what might become of the old
Grady place, a timbered and grassy piece of high country that seems to roll up
to the edge of the big sky.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MONTANA LANDS BEING CARVED UP
'RANCHETTES' REPLACE WORKING RANCHES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "We've got to give the place up to pay for taxes, and I feel like the
vultures are circling," she said. "I look around and see these ranchettes on
what used to be working ranches, and it just disgusts me.";   A new
phenomenon;   She is referring to a new real-estate phenomenon in Montana:
big, open ranches going under the knife of subdivision and being marketed to
urbanites in distant cities.;   Carved into lots as small as 20 acres, they
are sold as ranchettes -- often too small to graze a single head of cattle but
big enough to meet someone's cowboy fantasy.;   Nobody is sure exactly how
much ranch land has been carved into small lots. However, a recent study by
the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a Montana-based environmental group, found
that in the area around Yellowstone Park more than 1 million acres of private
land has been sliced into recreational or residential subdivisions.;  
Although other Western states are seeing ranchettes where there used to be
nothing but cattle or sheep, no state has quite the expanse of property, the
low price or the celebrity cachet -- this year, at least -- of Montana.;   The
advertisement for the Grady ranch is typical. "Live the dream," proclaims the
advertisement in Montana magazine.;   Certainly, ranch life in this cold
region northwest of Helena, the state capital, has been more work than dream
for the Gradys. But all around them, the dream is unfolding, or so it seems,
to celebrities who want very little to do with cattle ranching.;   Celebrity
buyers;   Among the celebrity buyers are broadcasting tycoon Ted Turner;
actors Dennis Quaid, Glenn Close, Michael Keaton and Brooke Shields. Their
purchases, real estate agents say, have helped spur sales of ranchettes to
other people.;   A 20-acre piece of Montana can be had for as little as
$7,500. But with every acre that goes out of cattle production, traditional
ranchers say, they lose influence in the state government. And as the value of
neighboring property goes up, so do their taxes and so does the pressure to
sell.;   Environmentalists say that for every acre that is burdened with a new
road and fresh-built fence, the elk, deer and antelope herds of the Rocky
Mountains lose more precious winter pasture.;   Thus, the real estate agents
who sell ranchettes have managed to do what no politician has yet been able to
do: bring ranchers and environmentalists together.;   "These ranchettes pose a
major threat for the future of Montana," said Bill Long, a director of the
Montana Land Reliance, a non-profit group that buys development rights from
ranchers to keep land from being subdivided.;   Thus far, the Land Reliance
has purchased rights to 80,000 acres, putting money into the ranchers' pockets
while assuring that the land will not be bought by someone wanting to turn it
into ranchettes.;   Ranchers 'very concerned';   "We're seeing more and more
subdivisions, and it's got us very concerned," said Kim Enkerud of the Montana
Stockgrowers' Association. "One day, the ranchers won't be around, and you'll
end up with something far worse than what you've got now.";   Montana, with
its open land ethic, has no statewide zoning laws affecting property of 20
acres or more and few regulations on what a property owner can do with that
land. A proposal to allow state government review of 20-acre subdivisions
failed by two votes in the state Legislature this year.;   Rep. Bob Gilbert, a
Republican who introduced the bill, said he will introduce it again next
year.;   "We're selling off Montana, piece by piece, to out-of-staters,"
Gilbert said. "These people are changing our state before our very eyes. You
can't hunt and fish on a lot of these ranchettes. Pretty soon, you won't
recognize this state."  </TEXT>

   Democratic Vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen was flying
back to Washington from Texas. He won a new term in the Senate, and
as chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, will spend
the next two years negotiating with the Republican administration on
issues such as taxes and trade.
   Bush and the new Congress began warming up to each other,
although no one was underestimating the differences after a long and
bruising campaign.
   ``The question is whether there will be a honeymoon. ...
Certainly there will be considerable confict between their agenda
and our agenda,'' said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, who
spearheaded the losing Republican campaign to win control of the
Senate.
   ``Look, there's no hard feelings,'' said the president-elect.
   ``Most of us have know George Bush for a long time,'' replied
Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
He said he spoke for all Democratic chairmen in saying he was
``prepared to work with President Bush and do that straight up, no
holds barred and find whether he means what he says when he says
that he expects to have a close relationship with the Senate and the
House.''
   Whatever else happened, the senators knew that Bush carried most
of their states. He won 40 of them _ and nine of the 11 largest _
inluding California, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Texas and Florida.
   Dukakis carried New York, Massachusetts and eight other states as
well as the District of Columbia.
   The race to pick a new Senate power broker was under way in
earnest. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd was giving up his
leadership post in the new Congress, and J. Bennett Johnston of
Louisiana, George Mitchell of Maine and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii were
in a race to succeed him.
   That figured to be a campaign as tough as any waged this year,
and with a tiny number of registered voters _ the ranks of
Democratic senators in the new Congress.
   Speaker Jim Wright of Texas was re-elected without opposition and
will lead the Democrats in the new House.
   All in all it was an election that treated incumbents kindly, yet
one that produced its fair share of fresh faces.
   The new senators included Joseph Lieberman in Connecticut, a
Democrat who ended Lowell Weicker's maverick career after three
terms. Former Govs. Charles Robb in Virginia and Robert Kerrey in
Nebraska turned Republican Senate seats into Democratic ones. Gov.
Richard Bryan of Nevada ousted freshman GOP Sen. Chic Hecht in
Nevada.
   Herbert Kohl was elected Wisconsin's new Democratic senator.
   Conrad Burns in Montana was the only Republican to defeat a
Senate Democratic incumbent. He beat John Melcher, seeking a third
term.
   Other newly elected Republicans in the Senate included Rep. Trent
Lott from Mississippi and Rep. James Jeffords from Vermont, both of
whom won open seats. Slade Gorton of Washington, defeated in a
re-election bid two years ago, mounted a successful comeback.
   One Republican, Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, squeaked to a new
term.
   Though a few House incumbents remained locked in tough races on
the afternoon after the election, that didn't change the overall
picture. Incumbency was practically a guarantee of victory.
   The few exceptions to the rule included Rep. Fernand J. St
Germain, a 14-term veteran and chairman of the House Banking
Committee. Beset by charges of ethical lapses, he fell to political
newcomer Ronald Machtley.
   Three Republican incumbents were turned out of office, including
Pat Swindall in Georgia, who was defeated by Ben Jones. Swindall
faces perjury charges.
   Other GOP incumbents who fell included freshman Jack Davis in
Illinois and Mac Sweeney in Texas.
   Democrats picked up statehouse offices formerly held by
Republicans, including Indiana where 32-year-old Evan Bayh wrested
control from the Republicans for the first time in 20 years. Gaston
Caperton ousted GOP Gov. Arch Moore in West Virginia.
   Republicans countered with one takeaway of their own when Stan
Stephens won the Montana statehouse for the GOP for the first time
in 16 years.
   Two Republican incumbents survived close calls.
   Gov. Edward DiPrete overcame allegations of unethical conduct in
Rhode Island to defeat a Democratic businessman for the second time
in two years, while fellow Republican Norm Bangerter was re-elected
in Utah.
   Republican Rep. Judd Gregg stepped up to the New Hampshire
governor's office.

   Former two-term Gov. Thomas Judge beat five
Democratic rivals to win his party's nomination for governor, and
Democratic Sen. John Melcher's bid for a third term is opposed by
Gordon Burns, a Republican county commissioner.
   ``People remember we had eight good years,'' Judge said after
Tuesday's victory. ``While they remember the past, they also wanted
to know our plans for the future. ... We put forth a program that
the people of this state have been waiting for.''
   In the presidential primary contest, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis easily beat Jesse Jackson for 19 Democratic delegates while
Vice President George Bush walked away in the Republican contest.
   Judge will face Republican Stan Stephens in November in his run
for the office he held eight years until his ouster by his own
lieutenant governor in the 1980 Democratic primary. Two-term Gov.
Ted Schwinden is retiring.
   Melcher quashed a token challenge from Billings lawyer Robert
Kelleher; Burns, a county commissioner from Billings, beat Thomas
Faranda, a Minnesotan who quit an absentee race though his name
stayed on the GOP ballot.
   Stephens, a former state senator from Havre who edged Rep. Cal
Winslow for the GOP nomination, says memories also may hurt Judge.
He said the former governor ``represents an administration from
yesteryear.''
   With 977 of 982 precincts reporting, or 99 percent, Judge had
46,274 votes, or 39 percent.
   Former Supreme Court Justice Frank Morrison Jr. had 31,868 votes
or 27 percent, and Attorney General Mike Greely had 26,742 votes or
23 percent.
   State Sen. Ted Neuman got 6 percent of the vote; Martin ``Red''
Beckman, a tax protester, got 3 percent and Emmett ``Curly''
Thornton, an ex-drug addict turned evangelist, took 2 percent.
   In the Republican gubernatorial race, with 99 percent of
precincts reporting, Stephens had 43,684 votes or 50 percent to
Winslow's 37,585 votes or 43 percent.
   In the Democratic Senate primary, with 977 of 982 precincts
reporting, or 99 percent, Melcher had 87,498 votes or 75 percent,
compared with 29,766 votes or 25 percent for Kelleher.
   On the Republican side, Burns, a county commissioner from
Billings, defeated Thomas Faranda, a Minnesotan who filed for the
GOP nomination but gave up his absentee quest in April, tough his
name remained on the ballot.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Burns had 63,007 votes
or 85 percent, compared with 11,419 votes, or 15 percent, for
Faranda.
   Melcher said the difference between him and Burns is experience.
   ``I think it's pretty obvious I've been here awhile,'' Melcher
said in a telephone interview from his suburban Washington, D.C.,
home. ``He's going to try and say that's a disadvantage, but I
don't really think it is.
   ``The longer you're here, the more chances you have to get bills
passed ... that will benefit Montana,'' Melcher said.

<HEAD>Bush Blames Democrats for `Gridlock in Washington'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush lashed out today at the
Democrats, saying their ``stranglehold on Congress'' is to blame
for the skyrocketing deficit and ``government by gridlock in
Washington.''
   ``Twenty-nine out of the last 35 years of Democrat control is
long enough. We must have more Republicans in Congress,'' Bush said
at a $100-a-plate fund-raising breakfast for GOP Senate candidate
Allen Kolstad, Montana's lieutenant governor, who is trying to
unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Max Baucus.
   Bush reiterated his promise to negotiate a budget agreement
``without preconditions'' and said ``we are getting some good
cooperation with the leadership on the Democratic side of the
aisle'' in those talks.
   He devoted most of the speech to a strident attack on the
opposition, who control the Senate by a 55-45 margin and the House
by 257-176. Bush is hoping to wrest back control of the Senate for
the GOP in this fall's 34 Senate races.
   ``With the Democrats now in the control of the United States
Congress, both houses, we're facing government by gridlock in
Washington, with spending skyrocketing out of control, good
legislation thrown aside for pork barrel programs and a budget
deficit looming over our children's children,'' Bush said.
   ``While the Republican Party is using everything we've got to
build a strong, competitive America, the Democratic stranglehold on
the United States Congress has finally taken its toll,'' he said.
   ``Enough is enough. We must end this 'deficits don't matter'
mentality,'' Bush said. ``I do not want to preside over these
godawful deficits that are saddling these young people here with
billions in debt.''
   He attacked Congress for not passing his educational excellence
act and his version of child care legislation, and blasted it for
adding $3.5 billion to his request for $800 million in emergency
aid for Panama and Nicaragua last spring.
   It took 108 days to win passage of the bill, Bush said, a delay
that ``jeopardized the hard-won freedom of the brave people of
Nicaragua and Panama. That's more than a difference between
parties. In my view that was a disgrace.''
   Later, at an anti-drug rally in Daylis Stadium, Bush criticized
Congress for not passing his anti-crime package.
   Standing in front of a huge banner with a map of Montana and the
legend, ``Don't Let Drugs Cloud The Big Sky,'' Bush declared,
``It's time for Congress to act. Our children, our communities and
our cops have waited long enough.''
   Bush was flying later to Cheyenne, Wyo., to attend a Frontier
Days parade and rally, inspect the nation's only squadron of 50 MX
missiles in their silos at Warren Air Force Base and get in a quick
fishing trip to the Middle Crow Creek Fishing Area before heading
back to Washington.
   Asked why Bush was going out of his way to inspect the newest
nuclear missile in the U.S. arsenal at a time of reduced East-West
tensions, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president wanted to
underscore ``the need to maintain a strong defense during changing
times.''
   Soviet missiles are still ``aimed at us. Our relations are
changing, but both countries have millions of men under arms,''
Fitzwater said aboard Air Force One. ``We can't let down our
guard.''
   At a GOP fund-raising dinner in Boise, Idaho, on Thursday, Bush
defended his reversal on tax increases and blamed Congress for the
looming $160 billion deficit.
   Addressing 900 people at an event that raised upwards of
$200,000 for Rep. Larry Craig's Senate race, the president said
Congress ``appropriates every dollar and tells the president how to
spend every single penny.''
   ``I have said I will negotiate without preconditions. And I
will,'' he said.
   ``You've seen the firestorm about revenues being on the table,''
aid Bush, who sowed discord in Republican ranks last month by
abandoning his ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge in acknowledging
that ``tax revenue increases'' are needed to cut the deficit.
   ``Well, I've done my part and now it's their turn. A truly
comprehensive package, not a temporary Band-Aid. There must be
reform of the budget process and there must be real spending
control,'' Bush said, his voice rising to a shout. ``The American
people are entitled to that!''

<HEAD>Feinstein Buoyed By Polls In California Campaign's Final Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Former San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein got encouraging news
Monday from two new polls in the California governor's race as she
and scores of candidates played out the final hours of primary
campaigns in nine states.
   In the often nasty Democratic primary campaign, Feinstein
maintained a lead over state Attorney General John Van de Kamp in
the latest statewide surveys. For months the two candidates have
attacked each other on issues ranging from abortion and crime to who
could best handled the state's fiscal affairs.
   Other new polls showed close races Tuesday for gubernatorial
nominations in Alabama, Iowa and New Mexico. In North Carolina, a
runoff between two Democrats will determine who challenges
Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, while four Montana Republicans were
vying for the chance to run against Democratic Sen. Max Baucus.
   Baucus was among seven incumbent senators facing token primary
opposition at most on Tuesday.
   The others were Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Howell
Heflin of Alabama and Tom Harkin of Iowa, and Republicans Thad
Cochran of Mississippi, Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Larry
Pressler of South Dakota.
   Except for Cochran, who will have no Democratic opponent in
November, renomination isn't necessarily a free ticket to another
term.
   Harkin faces a tough re-election race against GOP Rep. Tom Tauke,
while Heflin and Pressler also are under challenge from potentially
strong opponents. Heflin's foe in November will be Republican Bill
Cabannis and Pressler will come up against Democrat Ted Muenster.
   With his outspoken conservative views, Helms attracts both
intense support and equally strong opposition. The Democrats, who
must decide between Harvey Gantt and Mike Easley for their nominee,
hope to capitalize on the latter in the general election campaign.
   Gantt led a six-candidate field in the May 8 primary but failed
to reached the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff. The former mayor
of Charlotte is seeking to become the first black nominated for
statewide office in North Carolina.
   The race for the Democratic nomination for governor of Alabama
was headed for a runoff, with none of the five contenders likely to
get the 50 percent needed to win outright in the first round. The
top two finishers would be on the ballot for a runoff June 26 to
decide who challenges Republican Gov. Guy Hunt.
   A Birmingham News-Huntsville Times poll published Sunday said
former Gov. Fob James had the support of 26.1 percent, followed by
state Attorney General Don Siegelman with 25.6 percent, Rep. Ronnie
Flippo 20.5 percent, teacher-lobbyist Paul Hubbert 20.1 percent and
state Sen. Charles Bishop 3.3 percent. The poll had a margin of
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   The biggest 1990 prize is the California governor's office.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian is retiring after two terms and
the GOP recruited Sen. Pete Wilson to enter the race to succeed him.
Re-elected to the Senate in 1988 with 53 percent of the vote, Wilson
became the immediate favorite to keep the office in Republican hands.
   With the 1990 Census likely to give California six new House
seats starting with the 1992 election, control of the governor's
office could determine which party draws the new district lines.
Democrats already control both legislative chambers.
   In addition to targeting the governor's race, Republicans also
are sponsoring two ballot initiatives on redistricting in
California. One would take it out of the hands of the legislature,
the other would give the governor an absolute veto over any plan.
   A new Los Angeles Times poll said Feinstein had a 13-point lead _
a gain of two points over a similar survey early in May. The poll
gave the former mayor 42 percent and Van de Kamp 29 percent. There
were 29 percent still undecided or supporting one of the nine minor
candidates on the Democratic primary ballot. The survey had a 5
percentage point margin of error.
   Mervin Field's California Poll, which gave Feinstein a slim 3
percent lead earlier this month, reported that margin had opened up
to 8 points over Van de Kamp, 42-34, in polling that concluded
Sunday. It had a 3.5 percentage point margin of error.
   A new Iowa poll in the race for the Democratic nomination for
governor was published Sunday in theDes Moines Register and said
Iowa House Speaker Don Avenson had moved into the lead with support
from 32 percent of those surveyed, compared with 25 percent for
state Attorney General Tom Miller. Former banker John Chrystal was
at 19 percent, and 20 percent said they were undecided. The survey
had a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.
   The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican Gov.
Terry Branstad in the general election.
   In New Mexico, a new poll published Sunday in the Albuquerque
Journal said state Senate Minority Leader Les Houston and former
legislator Frank Bond each had the support of 29.2 percent of the
registered Republicans asked their preference in the GOP
gubernatorial primary.
   On the Democratic side, former Gov. Bruce King had the backing of
42.7 percent, while state Attorney General Paul Bardacke was
supported by 31.5 percent. The New Mexico survey had a margin of
error of 4 percentage points on the Democratic side and 5 percentage
points on the GOP side.

   A food-store millionaire, LBJ's son-in-law, a
folksy farm broadcaster, a Vietnam war hero: These are a few of the
11 new senators who will take their place when the 101st Congress
convenes on Tuesday.
   The new senators will spend their first weeks hiring staff,
settling into their new offices and generally learning the ropes.
   Seven of the 11 were trained as lawyers. Four are congressmen.
Three were or are governors of their states. One is his state's
attorney general.
   One was appointed to the job to fill the seat of the vice
president-elect.
   Six are Republicans and five are Democrats. The latter join the
majority side of the aisle, where their party holds 55 seats to the
opposition's 45.
   Joining the majority Democrats are:

   Bryan, 51, has been Nevada's Democratic governor since 1983,
mounting a stubborn running battle against federal efforts to locate
a nuclear waste dump in the state. He is expected to continue that
fight in the Senate.
   A lawyer, Bryan has had a long public career, beginning as a
county public defender and prosecutor. He served in the Nevada state
Assembly and Senate, then won election as state attorney general. He
was re-elected to a second term as governor in 1986 with 72 percent

   His popularity stems in part from his diversification of Nevada's

system.
   Bryan defeated Sen. Chic Hecht, a one-term Republican, to win his

   Kerrey, 45, a former Nebraska governor, is a combat veteran of
Vietnam who later became an outspoken opponent of the war.
   He lost a leg below the knee in 1969 while leading a Navy
commando raid on a North Vietnamese listening post.
   The injury hospitalized him for months. Later, as his opposition
to the war deepened, he almost refused to accept the Congressional
Medal of Honor from President Richard Nixon.
   Returning to Nebraska, he built a thriving chain of restaurants
and health clubs and, despite his war injury, ran in marathons using
an artificial leg.
   Kerrey is perhaps best known outside his native state for his
social life: He dated actress Debra Winger for a time.
   He first ventured into politics in 1982 and, in an upset,
unseated Republican Gov. Charles Thone.
   As governor he eliminated a large budget deficit, and fought for
changes in banking law and in the state education system.
   Although he was a clear favorite for re-election, Kerrey
announced in 1985 he would take time out from politics.
   He rejoined the fray in a challenge to Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb.,
who had been appointed to the job to fill a vacancy.
   Karnes handed Kerrey a major political windfall during the
campaign in one of the nation's most agricultural states. He
announced that ``we need fewer farmers.''

Milwaukee and won the thanks of Wisconsin sports fans as a result.
Kohl is also part owner of an American League baseball team, the
Milwaukee Brewers.
   Kohl's fortune is based on a string of local food stores _ now
sold _ that bear the family name. He also has extensive commercial

   Kohl spent millions of dollars of his own money to win the
Democratic primary against rivals who included a former governor and
a sitting congressman. He spent millions more to win in November,
defeating state Sen. Susan Engeleiter.
   He will succeed William Proxmire, the independent and frugal

   Kohl didn't accept such contributions either. He didn't have to.
But his wealth gave him a certain independence akin to Proxmire's.

   A career politician, Lieberman was elected to the Connecticut
state Senate in 1971 and served as its majority leader from 1975 to
1981. He was elected the state's attorney general in 1983.
   In the Senate campaign he proved conservative enough to attract
Republican voters unhappy with Weicker and liberal enough to hold
most Democrats.
   He portrayed Weicker as unresponsive to Connecticut's needs and
some of his television commercials were cartoons portraying the
physically imposing senator as a sleeping bear.
   In contrast with Weicker, he said he supported U.S. military
actions in Grenada and Libya. He advocated a moment of silence in
public schools in lieu of prayer.
   In his two terms as attorney general he cultivated an image as

<HEAD>Democrats Lead in Rhode Island, Indiana, Utah and West Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats are given a good chance of retaking the governor's
mansion in Rhode Island, Indiana, Utah and West Virginia as 12
states fill their top job in contests that have grown closer and
nastier with the approach of Election Day.
   Allegations of racism shadow Indiana's campaign; in Rhode Island,
the hiring of a reputed mobster's ex-wife for a state job has become
an issue, and the race in North Carolina has used television with
notably creative malice.
   Democrats hold 27 of the 50 governorships. Nine incumbents _ six
Republicans and three Democrats _ will be on the ballot. Republican
Robert Orr of Indiana is barred by law from a third term; Montana
Democrat Ted Schwinden and New Hampshire Republican John Sununu are
retiring.
   If Massachussetts' Michael Dukakis is elected president, Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy, also a Democrat, will serve out his term, which
expires in 1990. In Nevada, Lt. Gov. Bob Miller will complete the
two years remaining in fellow Democrat Dick Bryan's term if Bryan is
elected to the Senate.
   Other states electing governors are: Delaware, Missouri, North
Dakota, Vermont and Washington.
   In Rhode Island, Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete faces Democrat
Bruce G. Sundlun in a battle largely over ethics. A poll last week
for WPRO radio and WLNE-TV poll had Sundlun leading 44 percent to 35
percent. The margin of error was 5 points.
   The poll came after the former wife of a reputed mobster was
given a job at the Governor's Justice Commission and fired in an
uproar two days later.
   Sundlun, a communications executive who lost to DiPrete by a
landslide in 1986, also has capitalized on news stories about
DiPrete family land deals, an unfinished bridge, and state contracts
awarded to DiPrete campaign contributors.
   DiPrete, in turn, has accused Sundlun of business misconduct and
mismanagement.
   Republican Gov. Arch Moore's bid for an unprecedented fourth term
in economically depressed West Virginia appears headed for defeat at
the hands of an insurance executive and political novice who spent a
record $2.1 million on the primary alone. Unemployment is high and
the government had to borrow $80 million to keep going this year.
Democrat Gaston Caperton held a double-digit lead in recent polls.
   In Indiana, Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz is turning up the
heat in an underdog race against the 32-year-old son of former Sen.
Birch E. Bayh, a contest being watched for the coattail effect of
the Bush-Quayle ticket in Sen. Dan Quayle's home state.
   Evan Bayh, Indiana secretary of state, leads by a much as 13
points in the most recent polls and stands to become the first
Democrat elected governor of Indiana since 1964.
   Mutz has charged that a Bayh TV commercial ``appeals to the
darker side of the human personality'' by evoking racist sentiments
against the Japanese. The ad contends many of the best jobs at a
state-subsidized Subaru-Isuzu auto plant will go to workers of
Japanese ancestry.
   An indignant Bayh responded, ``I would never do anything to
appeal to anyone's racial bigotry.''
   In Utah, Republican Norm Bangerter's bid for a second term is in
deep trouble against Democrat Ted Wilson, former mayor of Salt Lake
City. Wilson leads by as much as 12 points, down from 20 last month,
and independent Merrill Cook has robbed Bangerter of support from
conservative Republicans who blame him for the biggest tax increase
in Utah history.
   In North Carolina, Republican Gov. Jim Martin leads Lt. Gov. Bob
Jordan, a Democrat, in a campaign that has made for good TV.
   Jordan has lampooned Martin's budget-writing process with a
commercial starring chimpanzees in business suits. Martin has run an
ad with footage of Jordan telling black newspaper editors he agrees
with them on some issues but won't discuss them publicly for fear of
alienating ``rednecks.''
   DELAWARE _ Republican Michael Castle has only token opposition in
his bid for a second term against Democrat Jacob Kreshtool.
   MISSOURI _ Republican Gov. John Ashcroft is strongly favored
against Democratic state Rep. Betty Hearnes, wife of a former
governor.
   MONTANA _ A comeback attempt by former Gov. Thomas Judge, a
Democrat, against Republican state Sen. Stan Stephens, is seen as a
toss-up.
   NORTH DAKOTA _ Democratic Gov. George Sinner holds a commanding
lead over Republican Leon Mallberg, a businessman making his first
run for statewide office.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Republican Judd Gregg, a congressman and son of a
former New Hampshire governor, is heavily favored over Paul
McEachern, a fierce opponent of the Seabrook nuclear plant who ran
two years ago.
   VERMONT _ Madeleine Kunin, Vermont's first famale governor, has a
robust economy heavily in her favor against state House GOP leader
Michael Bernhardt.
   WASHINGTON _ Democrat Booth Gardner rolls toward re-election
against state Rep. Bob Williams, who comes out of the evangelical
wing of the Republican Party.

   Dianne Feinstein and John Van de Kamp sweat out the voters'
verdict today in California's Democratic gubernatorial primary, the
featured contest on a nine-state election day that stretched from
New Jersey to New Mexico.
   North Carolina's Democrats were picking an opponent to face
conservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms in the fall. The choice in
a runoff primary was between prosecutor Mike Easley and former
Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, bidding to become the first black
nominated for statewide office in his state.
   ``I'm ready to get into this fight'' with Helms, Gantt said as he
cast his own ballot today. ``I'm ready to get it on with him.''
   In all, five states had primaries for governor on the ballot. The
tally of Senate races ran to eight states. Dozens of members of
Congress sought nomination for new term, and waited to learn the
names of their opponents for the November election.
   In one statewide referendum of note, Californians were deciding
whether to accept a doubling in the statewide gasoline tax, from
nine cents a gallon to 18 cents over five years. The first year's
increase would be a nickel.
   Seven incumbent senators were on the ballot, facing token
opposition at most.
   They included Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Howell Heflin
of Alabama, Max Baucus of Montana and Tom Harkin of Iowa; and
Republicans Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Pete Domenici of New Mexico
and Larry Pressler of South Dakota. Helms already has secured the
GOP nomination in North Carolina.
   Cochran was assured of a new term, since no Democrat filed
candidate's papers for the primary.
   The statehouse races were in Iowa, New Mexico, South Dakota,
Alabama and California, where Republican Gov. George Deukmejian is
retiring after two terms.
   GOP Sen. Pete Wilson and his $3.5 million war chest awaited the
winner of the contest between Feinstein, the former San Francisco
mayor, and Van de Kamp, California's attorney general.
   The Democratic race was nothing if not expensive, as both
Feinstein and Van de Kamp raised more than $6 million for their
candidacies.
   Both candidates underscored their support for abortion rights in
the final hours of their campaign.
   Feinstein campaigned to the end as tough on crime, trying to
seize an issue that seemed more likely to belong to her opponent,
the attorney general.
   She ran a late-campaign commercial on television criticizing Van
de Kamp for declining to prosecute a suspect in the Hillside
Strangler case in which 10 people were killed. Van de Kamp was the
Los Angeles district attorney at the time, and the suspect, Angelo
Buono, was later convicted of murder after the state attorney
general stepped into the case.
   Van de Kamp called the criticism ``baloney.''
   New Mexico had four-way races in both gubernatorial primaries.
   Republican Govs. Guy Hunt of Alabama, George Mickelson of South
Dakota and Terry Branstad of Iowa were seeking new terms.
   Iowa's Democratic primary race was being watched for any
significance on the national debate over abortion. Democrats there
chose among three contenders _ abortion-rights supporters Don
Avenson and John Chrystal and a third contender who opposes
abortion, state Attorney General Tom Miller.
   California's statehouse race was the one drawing the most
national attention.
   The state is expected to gain at least five seats in the
congressional redistricting based on the 1990 census. Republicans
are hopeful that Wilson can gain the governor's chair, and give them
a check against the heavily Democratic legislature when it comes
time to draw legislative district boundaries.
   The race for the Democratic nomination for governor of Alabama
was headed for a runoff, with none of the five contenders likely to
get the 50 percent needed to win outright in the first round. The
top two finishers would be on the ballot for a runoff June 26 to
decide the challenger to Republican Gov. Guy Hunt.
   In the Senate contests, Republican Rep. Tom Tauke was on the Iowa
primary ballot to take on Harkin in the fall in what is expected to
be one of the nation's hottest races.
   Alabama's Heflin and South Dakota's Pressler also are under
challenge from potentially strong opponents. Heflin's foe in
November will be Republican Bill Cabannis and Pressler will come up
against Democrat Ted Muenster.
   In the North Carolina Senate race, Helms is running commercials
attacking both Democrats on the runoff primary ballot.
   Gantt led a six-candidate field in the May 8 primary but failed
to reach the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff.
   Only one House incumbent has been defeated for renomination this
year, Republican Donald ``Buz'' Lukens of Ohio. He was convicted of
contributing to the unruliness of a minor after being accused of
having sex with her.
   A few other House members have had closer-than-expected primary
races, though, and such races are closely watched for signs of voter
dissatisfaction over a large congressional pay raise approved late
last year.
   In one House race, former professional football player Phil
McConkey in New Jersey is running for a House seat as an
anti-abortion Republican.

   Some legislators want the state to cash in
on credit cards as a way of balancing demands for increased spending
and lower taxes.
   A House committee on Thursday approved legislation that would
have the state issue MasterCard or Visa cards for a commission.
   If approved by the full House during the next week, it would be
sent to the Senate.
   This predominantly agricultural state of 804,000 residents could
reap in millions of dollars in extra revenue by sponsoring the card,
said Democratic Rep. Mark O'Keefe.
   Montana's chief tax collector, Revenue Director Ken Nordtvedt,
thinks it's a good idea.
   ``Every organization under the sun is doing this,'' he said. ``I
have two of those cards in my pocket right now from fraternal
organizations. ...
   ``And this being our centennial year, where there's a little more
sense of pride in Montana, the Department of Revenue is certainly
willing to administer such a program,'' he said.
   O'Keefe, who sponsored the legislation, said the idea came from a
constituent.
   ``At first, I thought the guy was crazy,'' O'Keefe said. ``But
the more I looked into it, it seemed it was not only legal but it
might work.''
   The card would have a special Montana design and would be issued
by banks, which would assume all liability and would process the
transactions, O'Keefe said.
   Each bank would pay the state a commission, perhaps 1 percent of
sales.
   The plan could mean up to $7.6 million a year for the state,
depending on the terms it negotiates with banks and how popular the
card becomes, O'Keefe said.
   Such groups as labor unions, wildlife organizations and the
National Rifle Association sponsor such ``affinity'' cards, O'Keefe
said. Banks like the idea because it gives them a broader base of
cardholders and more interest income.
   ``It's such a cutthroat industry that the affinity cards have
become big business for banks,'' he said. ``It increases the number
of people who want to carry these cards and all of these
organizations are making money on it.''
   O'Keefe, who believes Montana would be the first government
entity in the nation to try the idea, took his proposal to the House
Taxation Committee this week.
   There, a lobbyist for the Montana League of Savings Institutions
liked it so much he proposed an amendment to allow savings and loans
to participate along with banks.
   The panel questioned whether state funds would be at risk under
such a plan, as collateral for credit charged to the cards. But
O'Keefe said participating banks would assume all the risk.
   The bill, approved 13-5 by the committee, calls for half the
money generated by commissions to go to the state's general fund.
   The rest would be used for public schools, which must receive
more state money because of a February ruling by the state Supreme
Court overturning Montana's school finance system.
   Using the card to support public schools would only be right,
O'Keefe said, considering all the retired Montanans who spend their
summers in the mountains but desert Montana in the winter for the
Sunbelt.
   ``All of our snowbirds in Arizona all winter _ 1 percent of their
purchases could come back to fund their grandchildren's education,''
O'Keefe said.

<HEAD>Montana is Proud of its Tyrannosaurus Rex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE DENNISON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When trucker Bill McKamey heard that
Montana's Museum of the Rockies had found a Tyrannosaurus rex
skeleton, he offered to make his vehicle and services available any
time, anywhere.
   ``How many times in your life do you haul a dinosaur?'' he
asked.
   The fossil T-rex found in the badlands of eastern Montana is the
largest and most complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus ever
discovered. It also is the first of four T-rex skeletons discovered
in Montana that will be staying here.
   That has become a source of pride for people in Montana.
   McKamey, for example, was one of scores of volunteers who helped
bring the fossil of the meat-eating beast from its 65
million-year-old bed in the dry, rugged territory around the
Missouri River to the display room in Bozeman.
   Although the Tyrannosaurus is the best known dinosaur, only
eight have been found - four in Montana, two in Canada and one each
in South Dakota and Wyoming.
   While Montana may be the most fertile hunting ground for the
T-rex, none of the fossils has stayed in the state.
   ``Until this, I didn't realize how many people were upset about
fossils going out of state,'' said Pat Leiggi, chief preparator of
paleontology for the museum. ``A lot of people told me they had a
ranch here and there, and certain people would come and take
fossils out and they never heard about them again.''
   He said that until the Museum of the Rockies opened its
paleontology department eight years ago, the state had no facility
to research the fossils. Now the museum has one of the largest
palentology departments in the country, and it has more of a say.
   ``Now, we know who's doing what,'' he said. ``Montana is in this
network of paleontology departments.''
   The Tyrannosarus rex was the largest carnivore ever to walk the
Earth. It grew to 35 to 40 feet long and up to 12 feet high, with
teeth 6 inches long.
   Museum staffers dug up the 90 percent complete skeleton over
four weeks this summer on federal land near the small farming town
of Circle.
   Army Corps of Engineer engineers built a dirt road into the
remote site and helped load the seven tons of fossils onto trucks.
McKamey was waiting nearby with a flatbed truck and hauled the
bones nearly 400 miles to the museum at Montana State University.
   The fossils, packed in plaster and caked with rock and hardened
mud, then had to be unloaded, weighed and set up for display. But
the museum worried that the floor wouldn't be able to support the
3{-ton pelvic section.
   ``We had a reporter in here and he wrote about it, and the next
morning, we got a whole bunch of calls, saying, `What do you need?'
It sure made my life easier,'' Leiggi said.
   Two state workers helped weigh the pieces, an architect
volunteered to examine the floor, a rental firm loaned dollies, a
construction company loaned a forklift and a driver, and a concrete
casting firm brought in a crane.
   ``We read a little blurb in the newspaper that they needed to
turn (the pelvis) over and that the largest forklift couldn't do
it,'' said Steve Anderson of Bozeman, who operated the crane. ``So
I called them and talked to them. ... It was a chance to see
something really rare.''
   Eventually, the floor was reinforced.
   Museum visitors can watch staffers cleaning and preparing the
bones in a display room, a process that will take many months. The
museum may eventually erect a mold of the skeleton or exhibit the
bones themselves.
   The skeleton was discovered almost two years ago by two amateur
fossil collectors, Tom and Kathy Wankel of Angela. Leiggi said a
call came from the front desk of the museum that someone had some
fossils they wanted identified.
   ``People ask us to identify bones all the time,'' he said. ``To
me it was just another bunch of people who wanted me to look at
their bones.''
   But when curator and chief paleontologist Jack Horner confirmed
that the Wankels had found the arm and hand of a Tyrannosaurus,
``our eyes were just popping out of our head,'' Leiggi said.
   Since the story broke nearly a year ago, reporters, scientists
and dinosaur enthusiasts from around the world have focused their
attention on Montana.
   ``When you find a T-rex, it turns out to be an overnight success
internationally,'' Leiggi said. ``I never expected this.''

   In Dan Quayle's home state, an Indianapolis Star poll published
Oct. 31 showed Bush with a 57 percent to 36 percent lead.
   In a bitter and costly governor's race, however, Democrat Evan
Bayh, son of former Sen. Birch Bayh, held a 54-40 lead over
Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz in a Star poll. Bayh is the son of
former Sen. Birch Bayh, who was defeated in 1980 by Quayle.
   Through mid-October, Bayh had raised $3.2 million for a tough
television campaign that attacked tax increases during the Mutz's
years of service with retiring Gov. Robert D. Orr, and criticizing
Mutz for his role in extending state aid to a Subaru-Isuzu car and
truck plant. Mutz, who raised $3 million, said Bayh lacks
experience, distorts the facts and, on the Subaru-Isuzu issue, has
pandered to racial prejudices.

   Democrats won this state by 3,761 votes in 1984, when favorite
son Walter Mondale was the nominee, and Dukakis will probably pull
out a similar narrow win.
   In the U.S. Senate race, Democratic Minnesota Attorney General
Hubert H. Humphrey III trailed in his attempt to win the seat once
held by his father. A recent Star Tribune poll showed 10-year
veteran Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger leading 53 percent to 42
percent.
   Durenberger, smarting from Humphrey's incessant attacks on his
voting record involving issues such as Social Security, Medicare,
health care and drug programs, withdrew his own negative television
ads for the last two weeks of the campaign. He challenged Humphrey
to do the same; Humphrey instead proposed to suspend all TV ads if
Durenberger would debate him three times every day. The offer was
not accepted.

   In the race to succeed Democrat John C. Stennis in the Senate,
House Minority Leader Trent Lott holds a lead over Democrat Wayne
Dowdy. Dowdy has a reputation for finshing fast, and Lott has
stepped up a series of sweeps through the state coupled with an
expensive advertising blitz. Dowdy concentrated on personal
appearances in rural areas.

   With Gov. Ted Schwinden deciding not to seek a third term,
Republicans believe they have their best chance in 20 years to win
the governor's office.
   Democrat Thomas Judge, 54, who was governor from 1973-81, has
published an elaborate economic development plan and made it the
cornerstone of his campaign. Republican Stan Stephens, 59, a former
state senator, has been on the defensive against Judge's attacks on
his conservative voting record. The Tribune poll found the race tied.
   The same poll showed Democratic Sen. John Melcher supported by 48
percent compared to 34 percent for Republican Conrad Burns. The GOP
hopes for an upset.

   In the race to succeed Gov. John Sununu, Rep. Judd Gregg faces
Democrat Paul McEachern, who made the Seabrook nuclear power plant
the key issue in his losing gubernatorial bid in 1986. This year
McEachern has targeted a broader range of issues and pegged Gregg _
a four-term congressman _ as a candidate for the privileged and
moneyed interests. Gregg, calling himself a fiscal conservative, has
denounced McEachern as a ``Massachusetts-style liberal.''

   The Philippines may become another
Colombia if anti-narcotics agencies cannot stop the increasingly
powerful drug rings operating in this country, a senator said today.
   ``Precisely, if we do not do something about this, there might
come a time when we will see the spectacle of the Philippines
becoming like Colombia, where drug lords even have armies,
helicopters, planes and even tanks,'' said Sen. Alberto Romulo.
   Romulo made the statement during a public hearing on last week's
report given by Sen. Ernesto Herrera alleging that at least 17
military officials are protecting drug syndicates.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
admitted during the hearing that there are military men involved in
drug rings, but he said officials are doing their best to weed them
out.
   At least 40 officers have been ousted since Herrera's report and
assigned to combat units fighting communist guerrillas in the
countryside, Montano added.
   He said the drug problem has grown swiftly in the last few
years. Most drug syndicates operating in Asia's so-called ``Golden
Triangle'' of Burma, Laos and Thailand use the Philippines as a
relay point to Australia, the United States, Italy, Iran and some
Asian countries, he said.
   A total of 2,543 people were arrested for various drug-related
offenses last year, and 1,884 were arrested from January to
September this year, Montano said.
   But Sen. Romulo said most of those arrested and convicted were
small-time pushers, and none of the three major local drug groups'
leaders or their top managers has been arrested.
   Col. Virgilio David, chief of the Constabulary's Narcotics
Command, said he plans to change men under his command as often as
possible to prevent them from fraternizing with drug ring members.
   ``The temptation is just too great for soldiers whose average
salary is about 80 pesos ($3.60) a day,'' David said.
   During the hearing, Herrera played the first of at least 15
tapes of interviews with drug pushers, military and police officers
who gave names of officers involved in corruption involving the
drug trade.
