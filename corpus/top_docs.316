   The world's first test-tube tiger cub pounced
and growled during her National Zoo debut Tuesday before settling
down with a big bottle of milk.
   The 20-pound bouncing Bengal is one of a litter of three cubs
produced by in vitro fertilization in an effort to save endangered
tiger species.
   Mary Alice, the only surviving cub, was born by Caesarean
section April 27.
   ``This is a marvelous step forward for all those cats on the
verge of extinction,'' said Michael Robinson, director of the
National Zoo. ``In 20 years of our lifetime, we have lost three
subspecies of tigers.''
   During a meetings with journalists, Mary Alice fussed and
squirmed until her keeper stuck a milk bottle in her mouth.
   Then, the yellow-and-black cub stood up on her hind legs,
grasped the bottle with her front paws, closed her eyes and sucked
aggressively until her chin was covered with milk.
   Mary Alice is expected to weigh about 300 pounds when she is
fully grown.
   A second yellow-and-black cub died of pneumonia three weeks
after birth, but zoo officials said the death was not related to
the in vitro procedure. The third cub, a white tiger, died shortly
after birth.
   The surrogate mother, Nicole, a 9{-year-old Siberian tiger is
from the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Neb. A male tiger named Chester
provided the sperm that scientists used to fertilize three eggs
taken from two other tigers.
   Mary Alice eventually will be housed at the Omaha zoo.
   Of the 37 species of felines, all but the domestic cat are
threatened or endangered, according to the National Zoo's Center
for New Opportunities in Animal Health Sciences. That means a
species is either dying out or not reproducing rapidly enough to
survive long-term.
   Since 1969, three subspecies of tigers have become extinct and
the South China tiger is critically endangered, with only 50
remaining in the world.
   There are more tigers in the world's zoos than there are in the
wild _ 31 black-footed cats; 21 sand cats; and 12 pallas cats in
zoos, according to center officials.
   ``Sometimes people use the words `captive' and `research' as
four-letter words,'' said Lee Simmons, director of the Omaha zoo.
   ``This animal's relatives are captive in Siberia and other
countries,'' he said. ``The habitats for many animals are in
isolated enclaves.''
   When tigers' natural habitats are destroyed, they are limited to
a small area, isolated from other tiger species in their home
countries. While kept in a small area, tigers inbreed, not
producing new genetic material, which causes extinction, Simmons
said.
   National Zoo officials said in vitro fertilization helps
conserve rare tiger species by allowing animals that are sexually
incompatible or separated by long distances to reproduce.
   Mary Alice is named after the wife of Ulysses Seal, a major
participant in programs to conserve tigers in zoos, Simmons said.

   Scientific efforts to save the world's tigers
finally yielded tangible results: a wiggly, yellow and black
test-tube cub named Mary Alice.
   The 20-pound Bengal tiger, one of three cubs produced by in
vitro fertilization, was introduced at the National Zoo on Tuesday.
Mary Alice, the only cub that survived, was born on April 27 by
cesarean section from a surrogate Siberian tiger.
   Her birth marks a milestone in efforts by zoos to save rare
tigers from extinction using in vitro fertilization. Today, there
are fewer tigers in the wild than in the world's zoos _ including
only 31 black-footed cats, 21 sand cats and 12 pallas cats in zoos.
   ``This is a celebration of what we think is a great scientific
achievement,'' said David Wildt, chief reproductive physiologist at
the National Zoo. ``We can produce cubs by animals who are no
longer fertile or have been apart for a long time.''
   Natural feline reproduction in zoos hasn't been successful
because most cats are picky about mates and sometimes refuse to
breed naturally. Genetically desirable mates often are some
distance away and transporting them is risky, said officials at the
zoo's Center for New Opportunities in Animal Health Sciences.
   Of the 37 species of felines, all are threatened or endangered
with extinction except the domestic cat. Since 1969, three
subspecies of tigers have become extinct, center officials said.
   Animals are considered endangered if they are not reproducing
quickly enough and if their numbers are declining rapidly.
   Scientists have been trying to adapt human artificial
reproduction techniques to wild animals for nearly 10 years, said
Robert Hoage, the National Zoo's public affairs director.
   Artificial breeding techniques have been successful in farm
livestock. But adapting the procedures to conserve rare species has
been slow, Hoage said.
   Ann Miller, a member of the zoo's reproductive physiology unit,
said the breeding is at a snail's pace because ``scientists know so
little about the basic reproductive characteristics of most
wildlife species.''
   But zoos have seen some success _ including an Indian desert cat
born to a surrogate domestic cat using in vitro fertilization at
the Cincinnati Zoo and a gaur calf born to a Holstein cow through
embryo transfer at the Bronx Zoo.
   Intervention has prevented many tiger species from becoming
extinct in the wilderness, zoo officials said.
   ``Sometimes people use the words _ captive and research _ as
four-letter words,'' said Lee Simmons, director of Nebraska's Henry
Doorly Zoo. ``This animal's relatives are captive in Siberia and
other countries ... The habitats for many animals are in isolated
enclaves.''
   When natural habitats are destroyed, tigers are limited to a
small roaming area that keeps them isolated from other tiger
species. When they are isolated, tigers inbreed, and the species
begins to die from reproductive problems, juvenile mortality and
disease susceptibility, said Simmons.
   The National, Henry Doorly and Minnesota zoos have worked
together on the tiger reproduction effort.

   Zoo officials on Wednesday announced the
birth of the world's first test-tube tigers and said in-vitro
fertilization could help preserve the endangered tiger population
as well as other species.
   Dr. Lee Simmons said two yellow tiger cubs and one white male
were delivered by Caesarian section on April 27 at Omaha's Henry
Doorly Zoo to the surrogate mother, a 9{-year-old Siberian tiger
named Nicole.
   The parents of the three cubs were a white Bengal tiger and two
Bengal tiger mothers, Simmons said.
   The white male cub died shortly after birth because of
respiratory complications unrelated to the in-vitro fertilization.
But the other two yellow-and-brown striped cubs, a male and a
female, are strong and healthy and being hand-reared at the Omaha
zoo, Simmons said.
   The births mean preserving an endangered species is possible and
helps the cause of researchers and zoos, Simmons said.
   ``For some of the conservationists, research has been a
four-letter word,'' Simmons said.
   Seeing the two ``cuddly little cubs can help show that maybe
research isn't such a bad thing,'' he said.
   Three zoos _ Doorly, the National Zoological Park in Washington,
D.C., and the Minnesota Zoological Gardens in Minneapolis _ have
collaborated on the project for more than 10 years.
   The in-vitro techniques have been used successfully in humans
and in farm animals, but progress has been slow in adapting the
techniques to wild animals, Simmons said.
   Research has focused on tigers because at least three of the
eight remaining tiger subspecies have become extinct in the past 20
years and only 50 tigers remain in the critically endangered South
China subspecies, Simmons said.
   The program began with a National Zoo research program using the
techniques on domestic cats. It is aimed at ultimately taking the
technology and techniques into the wild, Simmons said.
   He outlined a scenario that begins with frozen embryos from
tigers in captivity in Omaha or other zoos.
   ``We go into the wild in India and Nepal and capture a female
for a short time,'' he said.
   During that time, scientists would induce ovulation and collect
the tiger's eggs, he said. They also would transfer the frozen
embryos to the wild tiger and turn her loose.
   ``About 110 days later, she would deliver cubs that she would
raise in the wild,'' Simmons said. ``They (the cubs) would expand
and enhance the gene pool.''
   Expanding the gene pool is important as the populations of
endangered animals decrease, Simmons said.
   As the habitats shrink and become more isolated, the wild
populations ``fall prey to inbreeding,'' Simmons said.
   The dwindling habitat means that the tigers ``may still be
running free in a forest, but they have unfortunately become just
as captive as animals in the zoo,'' he said.
   ``The techniques can help enhance the survival of the zoo
captives and the wild captives,'' Simmons said.
   The program in the wild still is years away as technology
develops to make the mobile in-vitro lab really mobile, Simmons
said.
   The in-vitro technique involves a veterinarian treating the
donor female tigers with a hormone to stimulate growth of follicles
in the ovaries. The eggs in the follicles then are stimulated to
develop further with a second hormone injection.
   A day later, the tiger is anesthetized and examined. The eggs
then are collected with a needle inserted through the abdominal
wall.
   The eggs are placed with sperm collected from a male in a
special medium in a warm incubator. In 12 hours, embryos are
surgically transferred into the reproductive tract of the surrogate
mother.
   The tigers involved in this first birth all came from the Omaha
zoo, which has 40 tigers _ one of the largest tiger populations in
the world, Simmons said.

   The first birth of test-tube tiger cubs
offers hope for the world's endangered tiger population, scientists
say.
   Dr. Lee Simmons said two yellow cubs and one white one were
delivered by Caesarean section April 27 at Henry Doorly Zoo. The
surrogate mother was a 9{-year-old Siberian tiger. The parents, a
male and two females, were Bengals.
   The white cub died shortly after birth from respiratory
complications unrelated to the fertilization. But the
yellow-and-brown striped cubs, a male and female, are healthy and
being hand-reared at the zoo, Simmons said.
   The in-vitro technique, a technology developed on humans,
already has been used for farm animals. An egg and sperm are taken
from animals and combined in a lab dish, and the resulting embryo
is implanted in a surrogate mother.
   Three zoos _ Doorly, the National Zoological Park in Washington
and the Minnesota Zoological Gardens in Minneapolis _ have
collaborated on the project for more than 10 years, beginning with
experiments on house cats, Simmons said.
   The aim of the project is to take the technology into the wild,
where tigers are endangered because of human encroachment. At least
three of eight tiger subspecies have become extinct in the past 20
years, Simmons said.
   In the future, he said, frozen embryos from tigers in Omaha or
other zoos will be used to impregnate females captured in the wild
in places like India or Nepal. The tiger would then be released to
deliver her cubs in the wild.
   The cubs born last month wouldn't be suitable for release
because they were brought up around people, Simmons said. They are
on display at the zoo.
   A project leader, Dr. David Wildt of the National Zoo, hailed
the birth as ``bringing us one step closer to using reproductive
techniques to preserve genetic diversity.''
   Sperm and embryos could be collected from wild animals and
frozen, helping ensure survival of endangered species, the
scientists said.
   John Schalles, a professor of biology at Creighton University,
said the program will likely help some endangered species, but
``the big problem out there is protecting the habitat these animals
live in.''

  [Text] Hong Kong, 21 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Some 
time ago, the relevant authorities in the Chinese mainland 
publicly incinerated a total of 280 kg of tiger bones and 
rhinoceros horns, both precious Chinese medicinal ingredients, 
in Harbin and Zhanjiang Cities. This was a gesture to show 
China's determination to outlaw the trading in tiger bones, 
rhinoceros horns, and all products containing them, in pursuance 
of the international treaty on the preservation of endangered 
animals. But there is a high economic price to pay on the part 
of the mainland in doing this and the production of a large 
variety of Chinese medicines will be affected for the time being. 
  Tiger bones and rhinoceros horns are fine, natural medicinal 
materials used in traditional Chinese prescriptions and have 
always been expensive. This is why tigers and rhinoceros, both 
wild animals, have been hunted to the brink of extinction. Take 
tigers for example. There used to be eight types of tigers 
throughout the whole world, namely: The Manchurian tiger, the 
South China tiger, the Southeast Asian tiger, the Indian tiger, 
the Siberian tiger, the Sumatran tiger, the Javan tiger, and the 
Bali tiger. But now, three of these are extinct and the 
remaining five types are endangered. For instance, India 
recently published the results of a survey on the Indian tiger, 
which indicate that the population of this tiger species dropped 
from 4,334 in 1989 to 375 at the end of last year. Another 
example is that, according to some findings published by the 
Chinese mainland recently, there are now less than 50 South 
China tigers living in the wild. If things go on this way and 
the countries concerned fail to adopt effective preservation 
measures, it is estimated that these wild animals will be gone 
from the earth by the end of this century. 
  In order to put an end to the hunting of and trading in 
these 
protected wild animals, China has promulgated a series of laws 
and ordinances in recent years, such as the "Law on the 
Protection of Wild Animals," "Implementation of Regulations for 
the Protection of Terrestrial Wild Animals," and "List of 
Wildlife Under Special State Protection." The repeated public 
incinerations of tiger bones and rhinoceros horns in recent 
years were conducted in accordance with the "Convention on 
International Trading of Endangered Wild Life." China signed 
this convention in 1980 and has rigorously honored its 
obligations thereto. According to an estimate, the mainland has 
suffered a total economic loss of as much as 2 billion yuan 
incurred by the ban on trading in tiger bones, rhinoceros horns, 
and products containing them. 
  Because tiger bones and rhinoceros horns are frequently used 
ingredients in traditional Chinese pharmacy, they are very much 
in demand. Therefore, the relevant research institutions on the 
mainland have always devoted a lot of attention to developing 
substitutes for the two materials. They achieved initial 
results toward the end of last year. Of all the findings, the 
research on tiger bone substitutes has been quite fruitful. The 
bones of the "sailong [1049 7127]," a burrowing animal which 
inhabits the Qinghai Plateau in large quantities, are an ideal 
substitute for tiger bones. Clinical research indicates that 
sailong bones have the functions of dispersing cold and 
relieving pain; relaxing muscles and tendons and activating the 
flow of vital energy and blood in the channels and collaterals; 
strengthening the muscles and bones; and enhancing the 
resistance of the human body. They are no less effective than 
tiger bones in treating inflammation, killing pain, and healing 
fractures and bone injuries. This achievement has attracted 
much attention from pharmaceutical industries around the world. 
Besides, the mainland researchers have also successfully 
synthesized rhinoceros horns, bear gallbladders, musk, and cow 
gallstones. They have also experimented on obtaining bile from 
live bears and turned it into natural bear bile powder for 
clinical and pharmaceutical use. 
  Hosking [huo si jin 7202 2448 6855], chairman of the 
standing 
committee of the "Convention on International Trading of 
Endangered Wild Life," who recently visited mainland China, 
pointed out: China has made outstanding achievements in 
protecting endangered wildlife and developing substitutes for 
them.

  [Text] Beijing, February 5 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
official said here today that China will strengthen cooperation 
with international organizations, as well with countries where 
rhinos and tigers live, in its efforts to protect the endangered 
species from becoming extinct. 
  State Councillor Song Jian made the remarks to a visiting 
international delegation led by Murray Hosking, chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). 
  The CITES delegation, which arrived here this week, 
inspected 
rhino horns and tiger bones sealed at a storehouse of a Beijing 
Chinese medicine factory yesterday and flew to Zhanjiang in 
Guangdong Province this afternoon to watch the burning of rhino 
horns tomorrow. 
  "China has lost two billion yuan since the Chinese 
Government 
banned the trade in rhino horns and tiger bones last year," Song 
said. 
  But he noted that it was necessary for the Chinese 
Government 
to take proper protection measures to save rhinos and tigers 
from becoming extinct. 
  "This policy is not only in line with the interests of 
Chinese people but will also benefit mankind as a whole," he 
said. 
  "It indicates that the Chinese Government has taken a firm 
and serious stand in implementing international conventions, and 
the international community should show its full understanding 
of it and give it the evaluation it deserves," he said. 
  "China has thousands of years of history of producing 
medicines from fauna and flora, while it has been only five 
years since it enforced the law to protect wild life," Song said. 
  "It is a gradual process in perfecting the laws and 
increasing the public's awareness of the importance of 
protecting wild life," he said. "You cannot expect to achieve 
all this overnight." 
  Song said that he hoped that the international community 
would understand the actual difficulties China is facing in 
protecting endangered species, as well as the Chinese 
Government's determination and achievements in protecting wild 
life. 
  "It will not help solve problems to put pressures on China 
and force China to do something which it is not able to do for 
the time being, disregarding the country's national conditions," 
Song said. 
  He added that China is completely open to the outside world 
in the area of environmental protection. "We welcome 
international organizations to send people to China to offer any 
criticism of our shortcomings and improve our work by giving 
their help and support." 
  Murray Hosking said that his delegation had clearly seen 
that 
China has taken resolute measures to protect wild life, and the 
country's legislative work in wild life protection was 
outstanding. 
  "We particularly appreciate China's open policy in wild life 
protection and the country has proved this in its policy banning 
the trade of rhino horns and tiger bones," he said. 
  The other members of the delegation expressed their 
appreciation of the sacrifice China's state-run medicine 
factories have made in implementing the government's policy 
banning all trade in rhino horns and tiger bones. 
  "I urge Chinese scientists to step up their research on the 
substances of the Chinese medicines and find substitutes for 
them as soon as possible," said Izgrev Topkov, a member of the 
delegation.

  [Text] Harbin, April 3 (XINHUA) -- Wild Siberian tigers, 
which were thought to be on the verge of extinction until 
recently, are being sighted more and more frequently nowadays in 
northeast China, due to expanding local forest coverage and 
meticulous human protective measures. 
  Miao Liping, a worker with the Dongfanghong Forestry Bureau 
in Heilongjiang Province, and other passengers on a bus saw a 
female Siberian tiger and three cubs drinking from a spring near 
the Qiyuan Forest Farm not so long ago. The cubs were each 
about one m long and 50 cm tall. They were so leisurely as if 
they knew that they were specially protected by the government 
and people. 
  There have also been reports that the endangered animals 
were 
recently seen in the Xiao Hinggan Mountains, Wanda Mountains and 
Laoye Ridge, also in Heilongjiang Province. 
  The tiger used to be regarded as the ``king'' of the animal 
world in China but human beings proved to be more powerful. As 
human activities expanded, the number of tigers was reduced 
drastically until the government and people in the country 
urgently adopted measures to protect the tiger and other 
endangered animals in the past decades so as to maintain 
ecological balance. 
  The Siberian tiger has also been listed as the most 
endangered of ten species of wild animals by the World Wildlife 
Fund International. It is the largest among all the ten species 
of tigers in the world. 
  A group of wildlife experts from the northeast China 
Forestry 
University confirmed that the number of wild Siberian tigers in 
China has increased to nearly 100 from the 1990 figure of 30. 
The experts have been keeping tract of the animal since 1980. 
  There are now less than 300 wild Siberian tigers in the 
whole 
world, exclusively in northeast China and Siberia. More are 
being bred in captivity. 
  According to experts, a Siberian tiger usually needs an area 
of a dozen sq km of forest to survive. It lives alone and is 
particular about selecting a spouse. An estrous female Siberian 
tiger has often to wander a vast distance before finding a male 
tiger. If the two tigers do not get along with each other, the 
female tiger has to look for another male tiger. Very often, 
before the female tiger finds a spouse, her estrum has passed. 
The difficulty for the animal to mate limits its number in the 
wild. 
  China has listed the tiger as a first-class protected animal 
since the early 1950s. Hunting of the tiger and trading in 
products made from tigers have been banned. In 1989 Zhang 
Guojun and two other farmers were sentenced to six years in 
prison for killing a Siberian tiger. In January this year 50 kg 
of tiger bones confiscated from smugglers and destined for use 
in traditional Chinese medicinal recipes were burned. 
  The country has also set up several nature forest reserves 
with a total acreage of 100,000 ha. The oldest one was 
established in Heilongjiang in 1958. 
In 1986 the China Administrative Office in Charge of Endangered, 
Rare and Precious Animals and the Heilongjiang Provincial 
Government invested over 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million U.S. 
dollars) to establish a breeding center in a mountainous forest 
at Hengdaohezi in Hailin County, Heilongjiang, to raise Siberian 
tigers in captivity. The annual expenses for feed, equipment 
and medical treatment in the center surpasses three million 
yuan. The initial population of five male and 15 female 
Siberian tigers at the center were collected from zoos in 
Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Guangzhou. 
  Tigers at the center are fed at 3:30 p.m. in the spring, 
fall 
and winter, and at 4:00 p.m. in summer. A total of three head 
of cattle are slaughtered to feed them daily. In addition, 
nutritional materials such as milk, eggs, liver, mutton, pork 
bones, racoon meat, yeast, multivitamins and dog meat are added 
to their food. 
  However, feeding is withheld on Sunday to increase their 
ability to endure the torments of hunger, as in the wild. On 
Fridays they are fed live food, mainly chickens and rabbits, to 
maintain their preying ability. ``This is to pave the way for 
their return to the wild,'' said Liu Xinchen, director of the 
center. 
  It has been reported that the estrus, mating and whelping 
phases of the Siberian tiger are strongly seasonal. However, 
Director Liu said, this seasonal behavior can be changed by 
using scientific management and nutrients. The tigers can be in 
estrus, mate, be pregnant and whelp in every season, with the 
peak birth rate occuring from June to August. The gestation 
periods of 12 pregnancies at the center so far has been 107 to 
108 days. 
  Scientists at the center also noted that when a male tiger 
was permitted to mate with five females at will, it mated 333 
times over 35 days, resulting in three whelpings. By adopting a 
managed mating method or separating the male and female tigers 
for 12 hours after each mating, however, all five females 
whelped, although merely 51 matings were allowed in 24 days. 
Moreover, eight cubs were produced from the natural method and 
14 from the managed method. 
  The tiger in captivity also selects its spouse carefully, 
Director Liu stressed. The technicians have to transfer a male 
tiger to the neighboring shed of a female tiger to let them get 
familiar with each other first. Even so, many of the 
neighboring tigers fail to mate. 
  A male tiger called ``Beijing Prince,'' which was 
transferred 
from the Beijing Zoo to the center in 1986, refused to mate 
female tiger no. 001 in 1987. Later, it was introduced to 
female tiger no. 014. Since then, ``Beijing Prince'' has never 
shown any interest in any other female tiger. 
  After seven years of effort, the center has succeeded in 
increasing its initial tiger population to 73. During this 
period 67 cubs in 28 litters have been born, and 58 have 
survived. Female tiger no. 010 has given birth to 25 cubs in 
seven litters, with the largest litter size being five. The 
tiger has been honored as a ``Heroic Mother.'' Both the litter 
size and the survival rate are records and the center is now the 
largest of its kind in the world. 
  Director Liu revealed that the center has mapped out a 
program to send the tigers raised in captivity back to the wild. 
It is expected to return some of them to nature by the year 
2003.

  [Text] Harbin, April 3 (XINHUA) -- Wild Siberian tigers, 
which were thought to be on the verge of extinction until 
recently, are being sighted more and more frequently nowadays in 
northeast China, due to expanding local forest coverage and 
meticulous human protective measures. 
  Miao Liping, a worker with the Dongfanghong Forestry Bureau 
in Heilongjiang Province, and other passengers on a bus saw a 
female Siberian tiger and three cubs drinking from a spring near 
the Qiyuan Forest Farm not so long ago. The cubs were each 
about one m long and 50 cm tall. They were so leisurely as if 
they knew that they were specially protected by the government 
and people. 
  There have also been reports that the endangered animals 
were 
recently seen in the Xiao Hinggan Mountains, Wanda Mountains and 
Laoye Ridge, also in Heilongjiang Province. 
  The tiger used to be regarded as the "king" of the animal 
world in China but human beings proved to be more powerful. As 
human activities expanded, the number of tigers was reduced 
drastically until the government and people in the country 
urgently adopted measures to protect the tiger and other

<LEADPARA>  AFTER A fight over a federal injunction sought by animal-rights activists and
lascivious speculation about which of four females would be involved in
breeding, Timmy, a 500-pound lowland gorilla from Cleveland, arrived at the
Bronx Zoo amid an atmosphere better suited to a circus.;   But at its heart,
the dispute is part of a fundamental shift in the purpose of zoos, to one
where breeding animals as a hedge against extinction is more important than
breeding animals simply for display.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  ZOOS SHIFT TOWARD ANIMAL SURVIVAL
BREEDING NEEDS NOW COME BEFORE VISITORS' WISHES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     To zoo breeders, those charged with the perpetuation of the endangered
species in captivity, the decision to bring the gorilla to New York was a
simple one: The animal, which had been captured as a baby in the African wilds
three decades ago, had never been bred with fertile females. Its genes,
uncluttered by the sort of inbreeding that frequently fouls captive
populations and turns their delicate lineage into something described as
"genetic spaghetti," remained isolated from the population of 302 gorillas
scattered in cages throughout North America.;   And at age 32, he was
practically elderly.;   "From the viewpoint of how best to manage the species,
it was decided that it was time to move Timmy," said Dan Wharton, a curator at
the Bronx Zoo who is the national studbook keeper for the lowland gorilla. He
is one of a dozen gorilla experts working together on a committee that meets
twice a year to decide the fate of individual animals.;    TO OTHERS,
including zoo-goers and members of animal-rights groups, the decision was
practically heresy.;   Timmy, after all, was one of the most popular animals
on exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoos, an animal whom zoo directors
could count on to keep attendance figures high. The two infertile females with
whom he was housed had been together as a group for several years, a bond that
if broken, animal-rights groups warned, would lead to "psychological damage"
for all the great apes.;   In the end, in a tangled web of exchange that
involved gorilla transfers among zoos in Ohio, New York and Colorado, Timmy
was moved. He is in quarantine until next week, when he will be introduced to
"two of the most gentle" female gorillas at the zoo, said Jim Doherty, general
curator.;   TIMMY'S TRANSFER marks a major triumph for a 10-year-old agreement
among North American zoos to selectively breed endangered species in captivity
with an eye toward maintaining genetic diversity rather than appeasing zoo
visitors in a particular city. There are currently 64 species whose breeding
is mapped by a survival species plan, in which a committee of zoo experts
rather than individual zoos decides where animals will be transferred to
ensure proper breeding.;   "There've been a lot of Timmys moved over the
years, and it's amazed me how well it's working," Doherty said. "I thought
that this one was going to be the real test (of the species survival plans).
It's one thing to move a tapir or a Bali myna or a radiated tortoise, but to
move a big, popular animal is something of a breakthrough.";   To Lester
Fisher, director of Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo, the federal court decision in
Cleveland upholding the legality of the move is a landmark, one that clearly
places the future of endangered species in the hands of zoo professionals
rather than zoo visitors.;   "And I understand that with individual animals,
such as Timmy, this can become an emotional issue at times," said Fisher, who
is also the coordinator of the gorilla species-survival group. "We may end up
moving one of the best-known names in town. It's almost as drastic as moving
one of the elected officials.";   WITH GREAT numbers of wild species drifting
precariously toward extinction as a result of human population growth and
habitat destruction, zoos have been forced to redirect their efforts when it
comes to breeding animals. Rather than exhibition, their goal is to form a
viable backup population for wild animals, a strong genetic reserve that could
be held for hundreds of years in order to reintroduce individual animals into
the jungle as they are needed to fend off extinction.;   Along the way, the
lessons that are learned about maintaining long-term diversity among a
population that may number as few as several dozen individuals may be useful.
Wildlife conservationists work toward the survival of island populations or
"mega-zoos" of animals in the wilds, animals that exist in pockets of
wilderness totally surrounded by human development.;   To a large extent, the
merger of conservation and breeding for display has succeeded because of a
happy coincidence: The very animals that zoo visitors want to see most tend to
be the same animals that are most in jeopardy in the wilds -- tigers,
gorillas, elephants, rhinos and other so-called "charismatic mammals.";  
Scarcity of those wild animals and the giant demand for them among zoos
spawned large breeding programs over the years but with little regard for
genetic diversity. A decade ago, for example, many Siberian tigers in zoos
around the country could trace their ancestry to a particularly fecund pair of
tigers in the Bronx. Inbreeding rarely became a problem because the gene pool
was occasionally bolstered with an infusion of genes from "founder animals" --
those captured in the wilds.;   THAT READY and presumably endless source of
new genes disappeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the combination
of the federal Endangered Species Act and a new code of ethics adopted by
members of the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums ended
the importation of wild animals for display.;   Zoos instead were left with an
extremely limited population of animals that will have to be managed
indefinitely if they are to survive.;   "There has been just a complete
evolution in zoos and zoo personnel," said Michael Hutchins of the American
Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums in Bethesda, Md. "In the past
zoo keepers and zoos were primarily collectors of wildlife, exploiters of
wildlife. Now they are protectors and producers of wildlife."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Captive Breeding Saves Arabian Oryx, Black-Footed Ferret, Others</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From Tahitian tree snails to Arabian antelopes,
international wildlife conservationists say they are succeeding in
saving some of the world's endangered species.
   About 200 specialists of the World Conservation Union's Species
Survival Commission met in Rome this week to discuss ways of
protecting animals threatened by poaching, destruction of habitat
and encroachment by man.
   The union, based in Gland, Switzerland, groups governments,
government agencies and non-governmental organizations such as the
Sierra Club.
   The three-day Rome meeting, which ended Tuesday, examined the
well-known plight of the African elephant, whose numbers have
dropped from 1.3 million to 700,000 in the past 10 years because of
poaching.
   But the experts also discussed the prospects for saving
lesser-known species such as the Mediterranean monk seal, Himalayan
snow leopard, Florida panther, Javan rhinoceros and Liberian
mongoose.
   In many cases, the answer is breeding animals in captivity and
releasing them in the wild.
   ``It's only in the past few years that captive breeding has
become an integral part of conservation,'' said Ulysses S. Seal, a
professor at the University of Minnesota who is chairman of the
union's captive breeding group. ``We project that 1,500 animals,
birds and reptiles will need captive breeding in the next 50 years.
Right now, we have more than 125 species on our plate.''
   Those include the Arabian oryx, a large antelope that became
extinct in the wild but was saved by breeding in zoos in London,
Phoenix and elsewhere. Wild herds now roam Oman, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia.
   ``This is the flagship example of a dramatic species saved from
extinction by captive breeding,'' Seal said in an interview.
   Another success story involves the black-footed ferret, a member
of the Wyoming weasel family. Only 17 were left in the wild in 1985,
but captive breeding has brought the population up to 124.
   ``We predict that in two years the population will expand to more
than 500, and in 1991 we plan to start releasing them back into the
wild,'' Seal said.
   He also cited efforts to save the partula, a species of tiny tree
snails found on the Tahitian island of Moorea. The species was
virtually wiped out by carniverous snails imported from Florida, but
the surviving partula have been taken to a dozen zoos in four
countries for breeding, Seal said.
   The next target is the Javan rhino. The lumbering beasts once
roamed across much of Indochina but today only 50 are left on the
island of Java. Seal said the union is working with the Indonesian
government to begin a captive breeding program next year.
   Captive breeding is not the answer for all animals, however,
especially members of the cat species.
   ``There is some captive breeding, but there are a lot of problems
in reintroducing a large predator that is captive bred,'' said Peter
Jackson, chairman of the conservation union's cat specialist group.
``For one thing, people are afraid of them. Also, a cat has to learn
how to hunt from its parents, it doesn't come naturally.''
   Nevertheless, conservationists have succeeded in saving the the
lynx, which was extinct in western Europe at the turn of the
century. More than a dozen were caught in the wild in Czechoslovakia
and released in the Swiss and French Alps in the early 1970s. Sixty
to 80 lynx survive in the wild today, Jackson said.
   Conservation has taken a unique twist in India, where man-eating
tigers have killed more than 500 people in the Sunderbans mangove
forests of West Bengal since 1975.
   It seems that tigers only attack their prey from behind. So three
years ago, wildlife officials began issuing rubber face masks for
Sunderbans workers to wear on the backs of their heads.
   Since then, no one wearing a mask has been attacked, Jackson said.
   ``Some were attacked after they had just taken off the mask for
lunch,'' he said. ``Tigers have been seen following those wearing
the masks but they have not pressed home the attack.''
   For all the attention devoted to tigers, elephants, rhinos and
others animals, it is some of the world's smaller species that are
most at risk, specialists said.
   ``People focus on the larger species that they are going to
miss,'' said George Rabb, president of the Chicago Zoological Park
and chairman of the species survival commission. ``But for every one
of these, at least 5,000 species disappear every year, mainly small
insects living in rain forests.''
   ``You could almost bet that the most endangered species in the
world is not known to science,'' added Martin Holdgate, director
general of the union. ``It is living somewhere in the canopy of a
rain forest. One of these unknown, inconspicuous insects. No
scientist will miss it, except as a statistic.''

<TEXT>
   An American wildlife biologist embarks
Saturday for the frozen wilderness of Siberia, where he will begin
a Soviet-American research project to help save the endangered
Siberian tiger, the largest cat in the world.
   Thousands of Siberian tigers used to roam Asia in an area
roughly the size of Europe. Today, fewer than 500 are fighting for
survival in a region smaller than Pennsylvania, according to Howard
B. Quigley, assistant biology professor at Frostburg State
University in western Maryland.
   ``Based on the way the population has gone down in the past 100
years, if we don't take some dramatic steps, we could lose this
species in this century,'' he said. ``If we don't do something, the
only place you might see tigers in the year 2000 is in zoos.''
   The remaining Siberian tigers live near the Soviet-Chinese
border on the east coast of the Soviet Union. But their habitat is
being eroded by Chinese and Soviets who are clearing forests for
timber, and to make room for farms and urban development.
   ``The loss of habitat is the most important, but a close second
is that people are hunting wildlife _ the same prey as the
tigers,'' Quigley said. ``If you take away all their prey, there is
nothing for them to eat.
   ``If we can get cooperation from both (countries) to develop a
comprehensive conservation plan, the tiger will be the winner.''
   The Siberian tiger, which can measure up to 12 feet from nose to
tail, has brownish-yellow and burnt orange fur with black, vertical
stripes. White and ivory-colored fur accents its throat, belly and
inside legs.
   A full-grown Siberian Tiger weighs between 450 and 800 pounds.
It is the biggest of cats _ bigger than the African lion, often
called ``the king of beasts,'' and bigger than the Bengal tiger,
the one most commonly seen in zoos and circuses. African lions
weigh up to 500 pounds; Bengal tigers average about 400 pounds.
   Humans admire the animal for its strength, grace and
independence, but they also fear the tiger, which has on some
occasions attacked people. ``Generally, they're more afraid than we
are,'' Quigley said.
   During the past two decades, three of the eight subspecies of
tigers have become extinct, he said. There are no more Caspian
tigers roaming central Asia and the Javan and Bali tigers in
Indonesia have died out.
   The populations of Bengal, Sumatran and Indochinese tigers are
stable. But there are only 20 to 30 Chinese tigers left in
south-central China.
   ``There are some Chinese scientists looking into the
situation,'' Quigley said. ``There isn't enough habitat and I'm
told it's hopeless.''
   Quigley, 37, is traveling to the Soviet Union with Maurice
Hornocker, director of the University of Idaho's Wildlife Research
Institute in Moscow, Idaho. The wildlife institute and Frostburg
State are helping sponsor the project, which will cost an estimated
$75,000.
   They will fly to Vladivostok, a port city of 550,000 just north
of North Korea, and journey into the wilderness with three Soviet
scientists to survey the tigers' habitat. They plan to begin their
field work 11 months from now.
   The researchers plan to trap the animals and put fist-sized
transmitters attached to collars around their necks. Using radio
signals, they will be able to track the tigers.
   The researchers want to know what the tigers eat and how far
they roam. They want to find out how often they reproduce in the
wild and the size of their litters.
   ``The Soviet researchers have learned about all they can using
the technology they have available to them,'' Quigley said. ``It's
time to use modern technology to expand on our knowledge of the
animal's ecology.''
   ``The Siberian tiger is one of the most impressive predators to
ever walk the face of the earth,'' Quigley added. ``If we as humans
_ the dominant species in the world _ can't protect their existence
by setting aside a tiny island where they can live, how dignified
can we say we are?''

<LEADPARA>  The world's first artificially conceived Siberian tiger has been born to a 7
1/2-year-old female at the Henry Doorly Zoo.;   The cub's birth Tuesday is a

health of not only captive tigers but also a dwindling number of wild tigers
confined by shrinking habitats, zoo Director Lee Simmons said.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  TEST-TUBE SIBERIAN TIGER IS BORN AT OMAHA ZOO
BREAKTHROUGH TO HELP ENSURE SPECIES' HEALTH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The birth culminated 14 years of work between the Omaha zoo and the
National Zoological Park in Washington. The Washington zoo developed and
helped to perfect the artificial-insemination technique used to fertilize the
tiger, Simmons said.;   Zoo officials had not been able to get close enough to
the new Siberian tiger to determine its sex but said the cub and mother seemed
to be doing fine and were being left alone.;   "The kit is acting and looking
very strong, and the mom is doing everything right," Simmons said.;   The
cub's father is a 9 1/2-year-old Siberian, which romped outside in the snow
Wednesday.;   Two other big cats have been born elsewhere in the United States
after artificial insemination -- a cheetah at the Caldwell Zoo in Tyler,
Texas, and a leopard at the Bronx Zoo in New York. Both died within 24 hours.;
  The Siberian cub is the second species at the Omaha zoo to be bred through
artificial insemination. Several gaur, a breed of wild cattle, were conceived
through artificial insemination.;   Two Bengal tiger cubs conceived in a
laboratory before being implanted in a female tiger were born at the Omaha zoo
in April 1990. They were the world's first test-tube tigers. One of those cubs
died; the other still lives at the zoo.;   The Omaha zoo said the Siberian
tiger cub is the first artificially inseminated offspring produced from the
Species Survival Plan, which recommends that animals be mated according to
genetic value.;   The project is aimed at increasing genetic diversity in a
species, which ensures more healthy animals. Simmons said the
artificial-insemination method means genetic material could be exchanged
between zoos, between wild populations and zoos and between wild populations
in different countries.;   The tiger that gave birth Tuesday was one of seven
that zoo officials tried to inseminate in July. She was the only one that
became pregnant.;   "If we can get to the point where 50 percent take, we are
going to declare (the program) a total, roaring success," Simmons said.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>10 Species Face Extinction in China, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten rare species of animals, including the Asian
elephant and the black gibbon, will disappear from China in 40 years
if the population keeps growing at its current rate, the World
Wildlife Foundation says.
   The foundation's report said that because China must concentrate
on providing food, clothes and shelter for its growing population,
it lacks the funds to protect endangered species.
   The report, quoted by the overseas edition of the official
People's Daily, said other animals facing extinction are the argali,
a wild sheep; Huanan tiger; Northeast tiger; Bactrian camel; crest
ibis; black neck crane; Chinese alligator and globefish.
   Some of the animals exist outside China.
   China is the world's most populous nation. It has 1.08 billion
people, and the population is expected to be at least 1.25 billion
by the end of this century.
   The Wildlife Foundation report noted that many endangered species
live in isolated areas inhabited mainly by minority nationalities,
who are exempt from the nation's strict family planning policies and
are using more and more natural resources.
   Some rare animals, including the giant panda and the golden
monkey, are caught and killed, it said.
   Chinese experts say there are now fewer than 1,000 pandas living
in the wild in several areas of southwest China. The Wildlife
Foundation has spent $4 million over the past eight years to help
the Chinese protect pandas.
   The report said wild animals have almost been wiped out in
isolated areas of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau of western China as a
result of increases in population and livestock.

  [Text] Beijing, March 30 (AFP)--China's forestry ministry 
denied Wednesday claims by a British organization that it was 
allowing the illegal trade of tiger bones despite promises to 
stamp it out. 
  "The position of the Chinese government is very clear and 
very firm: since May 29, 1993, the law prohibits the 
possession, trading and use of tiger bones and rhinoceros 
horns," said ministry spokesman Su Yan by telephone. 
  Both substances are used in traditional Asian medicine and 
are often thought to be aphrodisiacs. They sell at prices 
comparable to gold in Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  The British group Tiger Trust has presented a film it made 
during a four-month investigation of the tiger bone trade, which 
it says shows a flourishing black market in China, threatening 
with extinction the 150 Siberian tigers left in northeastern 
China. 
  "The rumours peddled abroad are false," said Su. "It is 
possible that a small group of criminals is trading in tiger 
bones, but you cannot mix the government up in that. The United 
States has strict narcotics laws and yet drug trafficking and 
consumption there are widespread," he said. 
  Tiger Trust also accused the Chinese authorities of lying in 
January after a widely publicized burning of what it said was 
500 kilograms (1100 pounds) of tiger bones in the northeastern 
city of Harbin. Quoting a "very senior official," Tiger Trust 
said the burning "was a fake." The group said the bones were 
almost entirely from cattle. 
  Su also said the Harbin bone burning consisted of 50 
kilograms, not 500. 
  "There were in fact fake and genuine tiger bones that had 
been seized from the black market, as traffickers also deal in 
fake bones." 
  A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman confirmed that under a 
Chinese law passed last year even fake banned wildlife products 
must be destroyed. 
  Su said "there are actually 624.4 kilograms of tiger bones 
stored at eight locations under the control of the Bureau for 
the Protection of Endangered Species ... all medicine containing 
tiger bone and rhinoceros horn has been withdrawn from the 
market." 
  In January the People's Daily reported the trade in 
endangered species was worth some 2 million yuan (230 million 
dollars) [as received]. 
  The United States has threatened China with economic 
sanctions if it did not put an end to the trade in tiger bones 
and rhinoceros horns. 
  Last week the UN-sponsored Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species gave China's policy a clean bill of 
health, saying it had made significant progress in protecting 
endangered animals.

   Consider the California condor, the Arabian
oryx, the Guam rail, the blue poison dart frog. They are among the
endangered species that have been successfully bred in captivity as
zoologists take the offensive to save many forms of wildlife from
extinction. Such conservation programs have now spread to more than
150 zoos and aquariums.

   No longer mere display cases for nature's
creatures, the nation's zoos and aquariums are taking a more active
role in trying to save species that are rapidly disappearing from
the wild.
   The American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums
headquartered in Bethesda, Md., coordinates a captive-breeding
program for more than 50 endangered species at more than 150 zoos
and aquariums.
   ``It's not the same old zoo anymore. It's not the little guy
with a mustache pushing a broom around,'' says Dick George,
spokesman for the Phoenix Zoo in Arizona. ``We have a
responsibility to face up to in the next decade. It looks like we
are going to be perpetual hosts to these animals.''
   For example, in steamy cinderblock rooms next to the Rain Forest
exhibit at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, curator Jack Cover
heads the breeding of the threatened blue poison dart frog.
   Herpetologists at the aquarium in 1988 became the first to breed
the species. Their success came after they spent five years
carefully re-creating the frog's natural environment, only to find
the tiny creatures prefer the bottom of a plastic 2-liter soda
bottle.
   However, the progeny have never lived up to their name. The
captive-born frogs, whose parents were found in the wild in
isolated pockets of jungle in Suriname, have never produced the
deadly poison researchers want to study.
   Many zoologists fear that they may become curators of living
museum pieces that won't have a home to return to in the wild. One
of the biggest enemies of endangered species has been habitat
destruction, but overhunting, pollution and introduced predators -
those brought by man - have also taken a toll.
   ``When you cut down a rain forest, you're not just cutting down
trees,'' Cover says. ``You're cutting down the environment for
thousands of species.''
   To avoid extinction, an estimated 2,000 species of large
invertebrates will need to be bred in the next two decades, says
Michael Hutchins, director of science and conservation for the zoos
and aquariums association. However, only 900 species can be bred
using current facilities, he says.
   ``Space is extremely limited. Decisions we make now will
probably doom some species to extinction and save others,'' says
Hutchins, who oversees the group's Species Survival Plan. ``The
same kind of decisions will have to be made for wild animas.
   ``Some estimates are that 1 million species of animals and
plants could go extinct in the next two decades. We don't know what
kind of impact that is going to have.''
   Zoos may need to maintain captive populations for as long as 200
years, until world population growth can be controlled and native
habitats restored, some biologists say.
   In addition, zoologists may be forced in the future to move
animals in the wild from place to place to maintain genetic
diversity, and veterinarians may need to make jungle calls to keep
wild populations healthy, Hutchins says.
   ``I tell people that zoos are going to have to change as much in
the next 10 years as they have in the past 100 if they are to
fulfill their role in conservation,'' Hutchins says.
   To be selected for the Species Survival Plan, a species must be
endangered and must be abundant enough in captivity to form a
viable gene pool. Computer records are kept of every animal and its
lineage to prevent inbreeding.
   The aim of the program, which began in 1981, is to create a
self-sustaining captive population for each species. The goal is to
reintroduce the animals to the wild.
   The Phoenix Zoo works with 14 species in the Species Survival
Plan and has successfully reintroduced the Arabian oryx, similar to
an antelope, to the deserts of Oman and Jordan. The Point Defiance
Zoo in Tacoma, Wash., and the Wild Canid Survival Center near St.
Louis have reintroduced red wolves to a North Carolina wildlife
refuge.

Joe Maynard is a tough-talking trucker who loves exotic big cats but has a hard 
time getting along with the state officials who try to regulate how he cages 
and cares for his rare leopards and tigers. 
</P>
<P>
"They try to tell us how to run things, but they've got no expertise 
whatsoever," said Maynard, a wiry, bearded man who spends 14 days at a time as 
a cross-country truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard and his wife Jeanne run the Exotic Feline Breeding Compound Inc. a 
private, nonprofit zoo located west of this small desert town in Kern County, 
about 80 miles north of Los Angeles. Many of the 40 wild cats caged here are 
endangered species, some are owned by zoos that have loaned them to Maynard for 
breeding. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators say the Maynards are operating a zoo without proper 
accreditation and have been keeping wild animals without a state permit that 
has been required since 1985, when new animal protection laws went into effect. 
The facility does not meet new state standards, primarily because its cages are 
too small, state inspectors say. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1985, the compound was exempt from state regulation because it was 
classified as a private zoo, officials said. But under the new law, such 
facilities must meet standards set by the American Assn. of Zoos, Parks and 
Aquariums, a national organization created to upgrade animal protection and 
public safety criteria. 
</P>
<P>
Already operating on a shoestring budget funded by donations and paid 
memberships in their zoo, the Maynards said, they want to upgrade their cages 
to association standards but have little money with which to do so. They have 
built one big new cage, for the snow leopards, but most of their funds must go 
for care and breeding, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bureaucrats in Sacramento are wrong. . . . We have a bona fide zoo," 
Maynard argued, claiming that the compound should be exempt from state 
regulations because it is a designated federal research facility and has the 
necessary federal permits to handle and transport endangered species. State 
officials agree that he has the federal permits, but say the new state rules 
must be applied. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard has little nice to say about state officials, but his whole demeanor 
changes when he walks among the big cats, talking about breeding programs and 
the need to keep the rare cats from becoming extinct. He is gentle with the 
felines. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life I've loved big cats," he explained. He bought his first leopard 20 
years ago for $600. The couple lived in Northridge then. "I wanted to breed . . 
. these leopards because they were being killed off and I wanted to do 
something to save them." 
</P>
<P>
The Maynards moved from Northridge to Simi Valley, then to Kern County in 1977, 
buying 68 acres to make room for their cats. Doing the work himself, Maynard 
built the cages and fenced off the compound. In 1983 the Maynards formed the 
nonprofit corporation and sold 2,000 memberships to finance the operation. Last 
year they raised $134,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Maynard has no college degrees, he has a good reputation among zoo 
professionals active in the work of saving exotic cats. Breeding the animals in 
captivity is essential to the effort to save them from extinction, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The Maynards' unusual collection includes seven North Chinese leopards, a pair 
of snow leopards from the Himalayas, on loan from the San Diego Zoo, several 
big Siamese tigers and three tiny Temminck's Golden Cats. The compound -- a 
haphazard mix of old cages, new construction and mobile homes -- is open to the 
public, without charge. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got one of the best collections (of North Chinese) leopards in the 
country . . . in terms of genetics." said veterinarian Allen Schoemaker of the 
Riverbank Zoo in Charlotte, N.C. Schoemaker keeps breeding records on the 90 
Chinese leopards in captivity. No one knows how many of these rare cats still 
exist in the wilds of northern China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Competent' 
</P>
<P>
"His knowledge of (big cats) . . . is very superior from what you'd expect in 
the private sector," said Pat Morris, a zoo veterinarian and assistant 
professor of wildlife medicine at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. 
Morris, one of Maynard's medical consultants, added, "He is very competent." 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Fish and Game officials concede that Maynard cares about 
animals but insist that his facilities must now meet state standards. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we had no serious problems with him, but the law has changed," 
said Celeste Cushman, a department spokeswoman. The state's caging and fencing 
standards had to be upgraded to protect both the animals and the public, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Maynards' cats are housed in cages that are about 10 by 20 feet. 
Each contains a heavy plywood shelter. The flooring is dirt and few of the 
cages have double-gated entryways to prevent escapes. As Maynard builds new 
cages, he is adding these safety features. 
</P>
<P>
When the Maynards failed to comply with the department's demands, the state 
Fish and Game Commission stepped into the controversy. At first the Maynards 
refused to participate in commission hearings, but in February they appeared to 
present their case. The commission gave the couple 90 days to come up with a 
plan detailing how they will meet state standards within three years. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to take animals away from him," said Harold C. Cribbs, the 
commission's executive secretary. Cribbs said the department has been 
cooperating with Maynard on developing such a plan. If a plan cannot be worked 
out, the commission could seize the animals, Cribbs said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, state game wardens are asking the Kern County district 
attorney to file misdemeanor charges against the Maynards for importing a North 
Chinese leopard in January, in violation of a department order. The animal is 
on loan from the Omaha Zoo. The state had instructed the couple not to obtain 
any more animals until they are in compliance with state laws. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard denied that he violated the law, saying that he had a valid federal 
permit to transport the leopard from Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
"They (state wardens) came here with the cops . . . (and) said we'd brought 
that cat in illegally," Maynard said. Zoo keepers who work with the Maynards on 
a regular basis say they are not put off by the compound's physical facilities 
because the couple cares for its animals and works to preserve threatened 
species. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true their facilities . . . don't meet (public) zoo standards," said Dr. 
Lee Simmons, director of the Omaha Zoo. "But by all reports . . . Joe Maynard 
doesn't fall short on animal care. . . . (He) really cares about his animals."

FT  02 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Profits from preservation - As
many US zoos are privatised, they are beginning to undergo an ecological
awakening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanging in the personnel offices of the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston is a
poster which reads: 'Extinction is forever.' At the hot dog stand, a message
has been taped to the napkin dispenser: 'Please conserve. Save a tree.' At
the African tropical rain forest exhibit, an entire wall is devoted to
explaining the ecological dangers facing rain forests in the world.
Welcome to the modern zoo, a hotbed of environmental activism.
Zoos and aquariums have come a long way since the dark days of cramped cages
and disregard for animals in the wild. While the image emanating from
Hollywood is still negative - the popular children's film Free Willy, about
a whale, caused an international furore last year when its decrepit
real-life living conditions in Mexico City were discovered - most US zoos
and aquariums today are highly sensitive to environmental concerns.
Zoos in the US are now seeking to redefine their ecological role in the face
of increasing fund shortages. Since many US zoos and aquariums have been
privatised, they are more dependent on their own revenue streams, and are
under pressure to set priorities. The challenge will be to continue
environmental programmes in a cost-effective way.
'Increased co-operation between international zoos will become more
important in the face of severe fund shortages,' says Michael Wallace,
curator of conservation at the Los Angeles Zoo. Animal conservation will
continue to be one of the mainstays of zoos' ecological efforts.
'Zoos went through an awakening on animal conservation,' says John Linehan,
general curator for the Franklin Park Zoo. 'In the past, we'd be happy if
the animals had a few babies now and then, to attract the public, but that
was the extent of our breeding efforts. Then we started noticing that
animals were getting harder to find and more expensive. We realised this
great resource we had, and that we could become a major player in animal
conservation.'
A number of species exist only in captivity, and zoos and aquaria breed
these species to prevent extinction. Reintroduction of the animals into the
wild is the ultimate goal in many cases, and some zoos have chalked up
stunning successes in this area.
The Arabian oryx, a large antelope, for example, was extinct in the wild
until zoos began to reintroduce the animal in the 1970s and 1980s. Today,
several hundred roam the deserts of Oman. Similarly, the black-footed ferret
was successfully reintroduced in Wyoming, and the Sumatra tiger in
Indonesia.
There are numerous pitfalls to reintroduction, however. The programmes are
extremely expensive to administer, so the number of targeted species must be
limited. Moreover, many involved in the industry complain that zoos and
aquariums are too often the last-ditch effort.
'Reintroduction from zoo populations is usually a last resort, an
after-thought,' says Michael Hutchins, director of conservation and science
at the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. 'Releasing
animals back into the wild would be more effective - and less expensive - if
we did it before numbers dwindled to a dangerous level. It's a lot easier to
boost the numbers of existing populations than to create a population from
scratch.'
Zoos hope to correct this problem by becoming increasingly involved in 'in
situ' conservation - that is, conservation in the wild.
Involving local people is the key to an effective reintroduction programme,
say conservationists. Poverty-stricken people understandably see
conservation as a luxury, and will often not hesitate to hunt endangered
species, or log forest areas necessary for the species' survival. Along the
Atlantic coast of Brazil, for instance, locals have been employed as guards
and monitors for the golden-eyed tamarin. 'The people who are dependent on
this animal's survival to make a living become staunch protectionists,' says
Benjamin Beck of the National Zoo.
Zoos and aquariums also see education as a priority in their preservation
efforts. According to AAZPA, whose members had a budget of Dollars 825m
(Pounds 557m) last year, 105m people visited a zoo or aquarium in the US
last year. 'That gives us a tremendous potential to reach the public,' says
Hutchins. As an added advantage, educational programmes are relatively
inexpensive to administer.
In addition, aquariums are especially good at incorporating animals into
their entertainment mix. Marine animal 'acts' often include environmental
messages. A sea lion at the New England Aquarium, for instance, makes a show
of tossing rubbish into the appropriate recycling containers.
While conservation efforts and education will continue, ecological
fund-raising at many zoos is likely to be curtailed over the next few years.
With limited resources, zoos say they cannot afford to raise money for
causes other than their own. So benefits for other wildlife organisations
are likely to be phased out. Research is also controversial, with many
institutions believing funds are too short to stretch themselves far in that
area.
Indeed, the availability of funds over the next few years will help
determine the number of environmental projects zoos and aquariums involve
themselves in. Environmentalism is important, say zoo officials and
managers, but they cannot afford to lose sight of their main function, which
is to provide entertainment.
'If people don't have fun, they will stop coming,' says Ronald Tilson,
director of conservation at the Minnesota Zoo, 'and that will be the end of
our ecological involvement. While we're worrying about environmental issues
we have to make sure that our visitors are having a good time with the
animals. In the end, that may be the most important message of all.'

<TEXT>
It is possible that, within years, tigers could become extinct. The
conference to update the Cites convention on endangered species, which
concluded this weekend in Florida, made that clear. Would extinction matter?
On one view, it might not: the loss would pose no immediate threat to human
health or wealth.
But on several counts, it is worth putting effort into saving rare species.
In western eyes, tigers, elephants, whales and the like are romantic beasts,
whose existence is valued even by those who never see a live specimen. For
local communities, the animals can add greatly to tourism revenues. For all
countries, the animals represent a pool of genes which has potential value.
What is the best means of saving these species? The threats they face are
poachers who want to sell tusks, hides and meat for profit, farmers who
resent the damage they do, and the steady encroachment of human societies
into wild habitats.
The essence of the task is to give people an economic incentive to keep the
animals' numbers at sustainable levels. But there are two particular
problems. One is that, as some east and central African countries have
found, the benefits of the live animals, through tourism, generally go to
the government and companies, while the value of dead animals is received by
poachers and farmers. Governments have found it hard to redistribute the
benefits of tourism at a local level.
Second, demand for products such as rhino horn, driven largely by Asian
markets, has not yet been checked by rising prices. Given the disparity
between Asian wealth and African poverty, it is possible that species would
be extinct before prices rose by enough to choke demand.
One solution is simply to improve enforcement of national rules against
killing animals. South Africa, which devotes considerable resources to
protecting its wildlife, has found numbers of elephant and white rhino
growing rapidly, even though it allows limited domestic trade in ivory.
But that requires funds which are beyond the resources of poorer countries.
One of the best arguments for maintaining an international ban against trade
in products of endangered species is that it makes guarding the animals
easier and cheaper even for the poorest states. The Worldwide Fund for
Nature estimates that the budgets for protecting elephants have dropped by
nearly 90 per cent in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania since the worldwide ban
on ivory trade in 1989
A third device is to reduce demand for the products. Environmental groups
argue that since the start of the ivory ban, the price of ivory has fallen -
where it can be obtained - while the price of rhino horn has increased. That
is, they say, partly because the main markets for ivory were in western
countries which have enforced tough import controls on ivory. Meanwhile,
western public opinion has turned against ivory,
There is no single solution to the problem of supporting rare species. But
the Cites conference was right to uphold the ban on elephant and white rhino
products, as one of several mechanisms. The next useful step would be to
increase pressure on those governments which have so far taken a relaxed
attitude towards import of banned products.

Some might consider it arcane that tape-recorded thunderstorms act as an 
aphrodisiac for the Majorcan toad. 
</P>
<P>
But not Quentin Bloxam. Nor, one assumes, the toads. 
</P>
<P>
Bloxam is a senior curator at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, better 
known locally as, simply, the Jersey Zoo, and he's spent 25 years learning the 
amorous secrets of some of nature's more obscure creatures. 
</P>
<P>
That's because his employer is no ordinary zoo. Instead of lions, tigers and 
giraffes, the tenants here are Round Island boas, cheetahs, pink pigeons and 
partula snails. 
</P>
<P>
Founded 30 years ago by author and naturalist Gerald Durrell, the Jersey Zoo is 
a pioneer in captive breeding programs meant to preserve rare and endangered 
species of mammals, birds and reptiles. And it claims the most extensive 
collection of such species anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo's symbol is the dodo, the flightless, turkey-like bird from the Indian 
Ocean island of Mauritius that became extinct in the 17th Century. There's a 
Dodo Cafe here, a Dodo Dispatch newsletter and replicas of the strange-looking 
bird everywhere one gazes on the preserve. They're reminders of what could 
happen to 50 other endangered species that call Jersey home if it weren't for 
the trust and a growing network of more conventional North American, European 
and other zoos that now cooperate in captive breeding programs. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the goal of these programs is to rebuild the supply of a rare species 
to the point where it can be reintroduced into the wild. In fact, that's not 
practical for most, because the same elements that threatened to make them 
extinct in the first place still exist in their indigenous homes. 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions -- such as the pink pigeon, which has been bred in 
captivity and reintroduced to the Maccabbe forest area of Mauritius; or the 
reddish-maned golden lion tamarin, raised in Jersey and several American zoos 
and returned recently to Brazil's Poco das Antas Biological Reserve; and 
Quentin Bloxam's Majorcan toads, which have been prospering with the help of 
his artificial rainstorms and tape-recorded thunder. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy being a midwife to Mother Nature, Bloxam said. Take the case of 
the Round Island boa, indigenous to an island off Mauritius but now believed to 
be the world's rarest snake. The boa is threatened to the verge of extinction 
by rabbits that apparently destroy its eggs and habitat. Early explorers 
introduced the rabbits to provide for future shipwrecked mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Field workers for the trust captured 11 specimens and transported them to 
Jersey between 1977 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us two years to perfect the management of them," said Bloxam, who is 
in charge of the reptile collection. "Then we had to try and get them to 
breed." 
</P>
<P>
Dietary experimentation finally worked, and in 1982 the first infant Round 
Island boas were hatched. They died in a matter of weeks, and it wasn't until 
1985 that more came along. 
</P>
<P>
Bloxam and his team first had to find a substitute for the baby lizards that 
the tiny snakes would have eaten in the wild, and then force-feed them, a 
process comparable to spending 90 minutes repeatedly searching for the mouth of 
a wiggling shoelace. 
</P>
<P>
By two years ago, the Jersey staff had perfected its techniques sufficiently -- 
feeding time was down to 20 minutes per shoelace -- that it could afford to 
ship three of the rare reptiles to a Canadian zoo. 
</P>
<P>
But Bloxam said the snakes died at their new home. "That didn't please me too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Now he's about to try again, loaning four snakes from his expanding collection 
to the Dallas zoo. But this time Bloxam has spent three weeks training a 
reptile keeper from the Dallas zoo, and the reptile curator is also coming for 
a two-day introduction to the species. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to get somebody else breeding them," said Bloxam. "I don't like the 
fact that we are the only ones." 
</P>
<P>
A nonprofit operation, the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust operates on a 
budget of about 1 million British pounds a year, equivalent to $1.6 million at 
the current rate of exchange. That supports about 1,500 individual animals, 
birds and reptiles kept on 25 acres of manicured parkland, as well as an 
ambitious educational program for local schoolchildren and visiting student 
conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
The trust's money comes from public admissions to the zoo ($5 for an adult), 
donations, bequests and proceeds from a gift shop and the Dodo Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
One of its fund-raising gimmicks is to offer its animals for adoption. A 
"foster parent" pays an annual fee roughly equal to the cost of feeding an 
animal and in return receives a small brass identifying plaque on its cage. The 
donor also gets a photograph of the animal and periodic news reports from the 
zoo on its progress and activities. 
</P>
<P>
Costs range from the equivalent of $800 annually for a lowland gorilla to $12 
for a partula snail, from Moorea Island in French Polynesia. And the program is 
so popular that there is a waiting list to adopt most species. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment we've only got snails available," Jersey Zoo guide coordinator 
Michelle Curwood said apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
However, chimed in reptile expert Bloxam, snails do have their advantages. You 
don't have to determine the sex of a snail to breed it, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"They're hermaphrodites," Bloxam pointed out. "That problem doesn't matter so 
long as you have two."

FT  20 MAR 92 / Technology: Tamarins return to the jungle - A Brazilian
experiment to save an endangered species from extinction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a lush patch of Brazilian rainforest a group of golden lion tamarins
discover the joys of swinging between trees. Brought up in the Los Angeles
zoo and recently introduced to the wild, they form part of one of the
world's most successful experiments in saving a species from extinction.
The project brings together first and third world nations, private and
public sectors, environmentalists and farmers, as well as several scientific
disciplines. Its techniques are now being copied worldwide.
Only 450 of the monkeys survive in the wild. Throughout this century many
have been captured to keep as domestic pets by people attracted by their
exotic beauty and flaming golden fur. Moreover, their natural habitat has
almost disappeared.
The animal has been rescued through the combined forces of Aldemar Coimbra,
Brazil's first primate specialist, and Devra Kleiman, a director of the
National Zoo in Washington.
Coimbra realised the danger in the 1960s when there were around 600 left. He
was unable to raise much interest until 1972 when Kleiman held a conference
in Washington on Saving the Golden Lion Tamarin. Experts from Europe and the
US discussed how tamarins could be reproduced in captivity and then
reintroduced to their native habitat.
Breeding tamarins in zoos proved so successful that there are now more in
captivity than in the wild. 'When I started there were just 72 animals in 16
zoos. Now we have more than 550 in 130 zoos and a third of them are on
contraceptives because they are growing so quickly that we cannot find zoos
for them,' says Kleiman.
In 1983 the team of Brazilian and American scientists began the more
difficult process of reintroducing those born in captivity into the Atlantic
rainforest in the Poco das Antas biological reserve south of Rio. So far 69
have been reintroduced with a 70 per cent survival rate and a further 60 are
to be reintroduced this year.
Denise Rambaldi, who heads the field programme, says that the animals
generally adapt quickly. 'Initially they do not know how to defend
themselves against predators and they fall over a lot because they're used
to stronger branches in their cages. But after the third tumble they usually
learn.'
According to Rambaldi, the main indicator of the project's success is the
ability of the reintroduced animals to breed among themselves and with their
wild cousins. Of 33 surviving offspring at least 10 are the result of
crossing wild and reintroduced tamarins, adding variety to the gene pool.
Family histories are kept on all former captive and wild tamarins to avoid
inbreeding.
'There is no doubt that the ability of once-captive tamarins to bear
offspring sometimes by mating with wild tamarins and their gradual ability
to feed themselves in the wild proves that reintroducing them into their old
habitat has been a success,' says Coimbra.
The project is special for several reasons, says Kleiman. Reintroducing
captive-born animals is a pioneering method of preserving species, and the
preservation of tropical forests is a developing science. It brings together
130 zoos, IBAMA (the Brazilian state environment agency), the World Wildlife
Fund and the Rio Primate Centre.
The success of the project is far from guaranteed. 'We're fighting against
time. In less than 20 years tamarins could be extinct in Brazil and thus
worldwide', warns Coimbra.
The main problem is lack of forested land. The reserve is only 5,500
hectares, of which 60 per cent is covered by forest. Each group of five or
six monkeys requires 40 hectares of forest and Kleiman estimates that 20,000
hectares are needed to keep the 2,000 tamarins necessary for the breed's
sustainable survival. 'The larger aim of the project is to regenerate the
Atlantic forest for tamarins and other endangered species,' she adds.
Consequently, the project's organisers are trying to involve private
business, aiming to raise Dollars 250,000 a year to buy remaining
forestland. So far they have persuaded 11 farmers to dedicate their
remaining forest to protection for the monkeys.
Another problem is a wave of tamarin robberies to sell on Brazil's black
market. At least 10 have been stolen in the last year and a publicity
programme has been launched to raise local consciousness.
'When we have the international community supporting the feeding and
maintenance of these animals outside Brazil, sending them to Brazil and then
hearing they have been stolen it does not look good for Brazil,' warns
Kleiman.
One answer has been to hand every tamarin back in a special ceremony to the
Brazilian government to create more local responsibility. But Mr Jairo
Costa, President of the Brazilian Foundation for Conservation which helps
fund the project, believes a tougher crackdown on the trade is necessary.
'Catching an animal is regarded as a source of wealth. It is hard to
persuade someone with hunger in his stomach that for the sake of ecology he
should remain hungry.'

<HEAD>Calls For Death Of Tiger Involved In Fatal Mauling Worry Zoo
Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Zoo officials posted an extra guard and took
tigers and other large cats off public display after receiving
telephone calls demanding death for a Siberian tiger that killed a
zoo keeper.
   Houston Zoo officials said Friday that they have no plans to
kill or transfer Miguel, the 450-pound Siberian tiger that fatally
mauled Ricardo Tovar on Thursday.
   No one saw or heard the attack on Tovar, but officials said the
tiger apparently smashed through a reinforced, wire-and-glass
window and dragged Tovar outside before killing him.
   ``This is a wild animal,'' said parks department director Donald
Olson. ``It's not a domesticated animal. One of the purposes of a
zoo is to preserve species, and tigers are not a domesticated
species.''
   The tigers and other cats would be kept off display at least
until Monday, Olson said. ``We're leaving them off display to let
things settle down,'' he said.
   Olson said he didn't know what was said in the phone calls, but
that the calls came from people who wanted the tiger killed.
Officials have said that the animal, which is on the endangered
species list, poses no danger to the public.
   While some were calling for Miguel's death, several zoo visitors
vigorously defended the tiger on Friday.
   ``I'm sorry for the man. But, I don't think he would have wanted
it destroyed,'' said Pat Hodge.
   Suzy Sanders, 23, who has a special interest in big cats and
goes to the zoo regularly, said: ``I don't want to be mean, but I
think it was more human stupidity. They knew that animal was
dangerous. Obviously, I think more caution should have been taken.''
   Larry Warrendorf, 52, a night keeper-watchman at the zoo, said
he heard negative comments from a few visitors walking by the
exhibit area where Tovar was killed.
   ``They were wondering why the cat wasn't killed, among other
things,'' Warrendorf said. ``That's the number one question I hear:
What are they going to do with the cat?'''
   Warrendorf said many people ``seem to act as if they want
revenge.''
   ``We don't know what to expect with the nature of people and the
nature of animals,'' he said.

   A 450-pound Siberian tiger named Miguel crashed
through a window to attack and kill an employee at the Houston Zoo
this morning, zoo officials said.
   Ricardo Tovar, 59, was killed after the tiger went crashed
through a 2{-foot-wide window that was part of his cage, said John
Werler, zoo director.
   ``It cut him up and ate him up pretty good,'' said Houston Fire
Department paramedic Howard Shaw.
   Shaw said Tovar, a 10-year-employee of the zoo, was found by a
co-worker about five minutes after the 7:45 a.m. attack. The tiger
was outside in a natural habitat display while Tovar was in an
interior hallway when the attack occurred.
   The tiger crashed through a window, attacked the zookeeper and
dragged him outside. The animal ran into an enclosed part of its
cage after zoo curator Tom Dieckow fired three shots and sprayed a
fire extinguisher to scare it. The animal was not wounded.
   Werler said the Siberian tiger would probably not be destroyed
because it is an endangered species.
   The tiger initially was reported to be named ``Rambo,'' the
other male Siberian tiger at the zoo. One of Tovar's jobs was to
feed the big cats.
   About 90 minutes after the attack, an orange sheet was draped
over what appeared to be a body on the ground at the zoo's tiger
display. The display was roped off with yellow tape.
   The zoo opened for business about 10:30, about 30 minutes later
than usual.
   The tiger has been isolated in its cage, officials said.
   The Siberian tiger is the largest of eight types of tigers and
can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds.

<HL> Australians Have a Devil of a Time
Tracking (Extinct) Tasmanian Tiger

   One hand on the steering wheel, Trudi Richards hangs out the window of her four-wheel-drive Daihatsu, peering at animal tracks in the Tasmanian soil. 

   As the vehicle lurches to a halt in front of a mud patch, she jumps out, drops to a crouch and stalks -- bent double -- through the damp woods. 
"Nothing but wombat prints," she mutters. 
"I think we can conclude that a tiger didn't pass this way last night." 

   Actually, Miss Richards is well aware that a Tasmanian tiger probably hasn't passed this way in 50 years. 
The species is thought to have become extinct in the 1930s. 
But tiger searchers, such as Miss Richards, don't let technicalities get in their way. 

   "I know they're out there," says the 24-year-old bushwoman, who makes her living by cutting roofing shingles and guiding tours in a nearby national park. 
Come winter, when snow makes tracking easier, she spends four nights a week searching for the nocturnal marsupial. 

   She isn't the only one. 
Since 1936, when the last known Tasmanian tiger died in a Hobart zoo, expeditions have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars seeking the wolflike creature. 

   Scientists say an average tiger stood 24 inches high at the shoulder and measured about five feet from nose to tail. 
Some old-timers, however, claim to have shot animals close to 10 feet long. 
The tiger had distinctive striped haunches and a mighty jaw that could gape 120 degrees to chomp its prey. 
But the female's rear-opening pouch made it a closer relative to the kangaroo and the Tasmanian devil. 

   Eric Guiler, a retired University of Tasmania zoologist, started searching for the tigers in 1957. 
"Last year I decided to give it up," he says. 
But this year he is on the trail once again, prompted by an especially convincing account of a possible sighting. 

   The persistent and numerous alleged sightings of the tiger are the only evidence that the animal may still survive. 
In 50 years, neither scientists nor amateur searchers have found a carcass, a skeleton, a convincing photograph or even a scrap of hair to prove that the tiger is still out there. 

   While searchers such as Mr. Guiler would like nothing better than to establish the fact that the tiger still exists, Tasmania's early European settlers couldn't kill the animal fast enough. 

   The tiger, the world's largest carnivorous marsupial, developed a taste for sheep introduced by the white settlers who came to the island in 1803. 
And a government bounty on the tigers encouraged their slaughter, even when it became apparent that the animal was in danger of extinction. 

   In fact, the tiger wasn't declared a protected animal until 1936, the year that the last one died in captivity and six years after the last confirmed killing in the wild. 

   These days, the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service takes the protection order very seriously, even though there probably aren't any tigers left to protect. 
Last year, it fined a farmer $500 for attempting to trap a tiger. 

   Many of the alleged tiger sightings tend to cluster in certain areas of the island, in the kind of thickly wooded, undisturbed country where tigers would be most likely to have survived. 

   Miss Richards's home town, Mole Creek, is right at the edge of one such cluster. 
She concentrates her search in the nearby thickly forested mountains. 
"It started off as a joke, a bit of fun," she says. 
"Then I saw one, and it wasn't a joke anymore." 
Miss Richards and two friends were driving down a woodcutters' track, when a creature trotted into the beam of the spotlight mounted on the roof of her vehicle. 

   "It had a big sort of funny looking head, small ears, a straight tail -- I suppose I saw it for about five seconds before it disappeared into the bush," she says. 
"We were so excited we just kept driving. 
There was snow on the ground. 
We could have tried to track it. 
I could kick myself now." 

   These days, Miss Richards and her partners, Natalie Harrison and Barry Richardson, are better organized. 
In a black briefcase, she keeps charts of tiger-paw prints, lists of local sightings, copies of papers from scientific journals and plaster casts she has taken from possible prints. 
The team now never goes out without plaster of Paris and thousands of dollars of camera equipment. 

   A recent expedition produced sightings of many possums, six wallabies, three Tasmanian devils, one boobook owl and one spiny anteater. 
The expedition also produced a few squirmy moments when the old four-wheel-drive Daihatsu wouldn't start on a remote bush track. 
"Two hundred meters further on there'll be a big tiger," grunted Miss Richards as she pushed the vehicle, "and by the time we get this thing down there it'll be gone." 

   Needless to say, it was.

   ``Extinction is Forever'' is the
motto at naturalist Gerald Durrell's Jersey Wildlife Preservation
Trust. Its symbol is the dodo, the flightless, turkey-like bird of
Mauritius that became extinct in the 1690s.
   It's goal is to keep more of the world's animals from becoming
extinct.
   The zoo boasts the world's most comprehensive collection of
endangered species. It protects animals by breeding them in
captivity and returning their offspring to the wild.
   On 25 beautifully landscaped acres of Jersey, the main island of
the English Channel archipelago, the zoo tries to recreate natural
settings for its charges.
   The trust also trains interns from all over the world to promote
animal survival in their own countries.
   ``We are not trying to maintain a living museum,'' said Anthony
Allchurch, the zoo's general administrator. ``We have a job to do.
If it happens that the public is interested in what we're doing,
that's great.''
   Founded in 1959, the zoo started out as a place where Durrell
kept the animals he collected during his expeditions. Four years
later, he formed the trust as a registered charity.
   ``The release of animals back into their natural habitat is the
ultimate goal for each of the species that we so carefully
nurture,'' Durrell has said.
   The white-bearded, 64-year-old Briton lives in Les Augres Manor
on the zoo grounds with his American wife Lee but was traveling and
unavailable to talk about his project with a visiting reporter.
   His books have been published in 26 languages. The best known is
``My Family and Other Animals,'' about his childhood on the Greek
island of Corfu. He also has produced numerous television
documentaries about animals. He is the younger brother of the famed
novelist Lawrence Durrell, author of the ``Alexandria Quartet'' and
other works.
   The zoo concentrates on six major geographical areas: northern
India and Nepal, southeastern Brazil, Mexico, the Caribbean,
Madagascar, and the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.
   It works closely with governments, wildlife groups, and other
zoos, including the National Zoo in Washington D.C.
   ``If we didn't work with government support and blessing, we
wouldn't achieve half of what we do,'' Allchurch said.
   The first animals that the zoo returned to a natural habitat were
14 pink pigeons that were placed in a botanical garden in the
Mascarene island of Mauritius in 1984.
   Three years later, the zoo placed pink pigeons in an area of
native forest that hadn't been inhabited by these birds for 10
years. To date, 19 have been returned to the wilderness, and,
significantly, two have been born there.
   ``We don't befriend, socialize, train or handle animals, to
enhance their chance of surviving the wild, if they ever get
there,'' Allchurch said.
   The zoo also sent Jamaican hutias, large brown rodents, back to
their island and is returning kestrels to Mauritius.
   ``A lot of rare animals are dull and brown. But two dull brown
parents with a baby are very exciting,'' Allchurch said.
   The zoo also has been a partner in programs to return golden lion
tamarins to Brazil, Bali starlings to Indonesia and thick-billed
parrots to Arizona.
   In 1978, the trust established its training program, which has
educated some 250 trainees from more than 40 countries. Many already
have had veterinary training, and they spend two to four months at
the zoo.
   ``You learn a lot. It's a great place here,'' said Susana
Ringenbach, a 27-year-old trainee from Tlalpan, Mexico. `You can
learn to educate the children not to go out and hunt.''
   She said she was inspired by Durrell's books and is particularly
interested in helping jaguars and spider monkeys.
   The trust has annual income of $2.2 million, 60 percent of it
from entrance fees. About 340,000 people visited the zoo last year.
   The remainder of the financing comes from private donations.
Along with its sister trusts in the United States and Canada, it has
20,000 members.

  [Text] Zhanjiang, February 7 (XINHUA) -- Some 230 
kilograms of rhino horns were set on fire today in Zhanjiang, a 
booming town of south China's Guangdong Province as part of the 
efforts by the Chinese Government to perform its international 
obligations to stamp out smuggling and poaching and protect 
wildlife. 
  The rhino horns were part of the 825 kilograms confiscated 
by 
the Zhanjiang municipal government from smugglers and illegal 
trading. As 595 kilograms of rhino horns were identified as 
having been seized before China joined the Convention on 
International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) of wild fauna 
and flora in 1980, they were exempt from being destroyed. 
  Hundreds of local residents watched the police poured 
gasoline and set the huge pile to fire under the supervision by 
representatives from the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of 
Public Security, the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce and the State Office on the Control of Import and 
Export of Endangered Species. Among the audience was a 
four-member delegation from the CITES headed by its Chairman 
Murray Hosking and Secretary General Izgrev Topkov. 
  The move was hailed by the CITES delegation as a "courageous 
act of the Chinese Government." 
  "We find this burning ceremony very much a demonstration of 
the commitment of the Chinese Government to wild life 
conservation," said Murray Hosking, CITES chairman. 
  "We think it is a very important gesture," he said. "It 
would help people in other countries to understand the efforts 
made in China to protect endangered wildlife". 
  According to the Chinese official, since the country joined 
CITES in 1980, it has stopped importing rhino horns. 
  "Though no rhinos are found in the wild in China, the 
Chinese 
Government has listed it as one of the key wild animals for 
national protection, banning its sales, purchase, transportation 
and import and export," he said. 
  It was the second time for the Chinese Government to burn 
rhino horns in public this year. Earlier this year, 50 
kilograms of tiger bones (including fake ones) and rhino horns 
were burnt in Harbin in the country's northeastern Heilongjiang 
Province. 
  According to Chinese officials, all of the rhino horns which 
entered China before 1980 have been sealed by the government and 
will be used by Chinese scientists for experiment to find out 
substitutes for rhino horns, an important and very efficacious 
ingredient in many of the traditional Chinese medicine. 
  In the meantime, the Zhanjiang people's police has arrested 
a 
group of people headed by Lin Chengjie from the Wuchuan County 
Pharmaceutical Group Company for unsealing the rhino horns 
confiscated by the government to attempt to smuggle them out of 
the country. 
  Smugglers from overseas had colluded with Lin and bribed 
him. 
Chinese police said that it has the right to investigate 
overseas smugglers involved in the case and may demand them to 
stand witness in the court. 
  According to officials from the Ministry of Forestry, rhinos 
mainly live in economically less-developed countries and 
poaching and smuggling there were very serious. Natural 
disasters are also destroying the rhino population. 
  The number of rhinos have been reduced by 85 percent since 
the 1970s and only an estimated 10,000 are found in the world.

   He's got dark legs, closely cropped hair, and
is about 4-feet-8. And, at the behest of a group of matchmakers, he
recently flew from San Diego to Memphis to ease the loss of two
widowed mares.
   He's an Asian wild horse, otherwise known as Przewalski's horse,
and his mission is to be fruitful and multiply, especially now that
his kind are extinct in the wild.
   Where he goes and with whom he breeds is up to a group of about
1,000 zoologists meeting at a downtown hotel this week to determine
the fate of more than 7,000 animals from 50 endangered species kept
in North American zoos and aquariums.
   What happens then is up to Mother Nature.
   ``We recognize that we can make a genetic plan, but we're
dealing with individual animals and they don't always read the
books we do. But so far, he's showing the right interests,'' Oliver
Ryder of the San Diego Zoo said Monday.
   Ryder oversees the captive breeding of Przewalski's horses
through the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums,
an umbrella organization of 140 institutions in North America.
   The organization is trying to rescue animals from extinction by
breeding them in captivity with the hopes of eventually
reintroducing them to the wild.
   ``Zoos can't hope to save everything. They can only hope to save
a small portion of the species of the world,'' said Dennis Meritt
Jr., a board member of the association and assistant director of
the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.
   ``It's better than not having anything,'' said Jack Grisham, of
the Oklahoma City Zoo, who oversees the nationwide breeding of
cheetahs.
   ``Remember the bison. Back at the turn of the century, there was
just a handful and the New York Zoological Society took them to the
Wichita Mountains in Oklahoma and they started breeding again.
They're the basis of all the bison in North America,'' Grisham said.
   But problems remain.
   ``Any place in the world today there's a problem with finding
space for wild animals,'' said Ryder. ``Whether they continue to
exist is completely up to one species _ us. It's our decision
whether we make the space and provide them with protection to
survive. It's up to us. Do nothing, and they're gone.''
   The association counts several successes among its special
survival plans.
   Only about 50 Bali mynah birds remain in the wild, but American
zoos have been so successful in breeding them that several hundred
are expected to be released into the rain forests of Bali in coming
years, Meritt said.
   There are no known free-ranging Arabian oryx, a type of antelope
once found on the Arabian peninsula. But thanks to captive
breeding, the oryx is being returned to the desert, Meritt said.
   Tom Foose, association coordinator of the species survival plans
for all the zoos, said zookeepers want to spread animal genes
around different zoos to avoid sterility, mutations and other
problems in breeding.
   ``Our objective is to stop evolution and preserve as much as the
gene pool as we can get these animals back in the wild and let
natural selection sort it all out again,'' Foose said.

PROTECTING the tigers of Ranthambhore, India's best-known wildlife reserve,
almost cost Devi Singh Rathore his life. The 24-year-old forest guard was
shot in the head, face and shoulder by a suspected poacher who fired at his
Jeep with a shotgun. The guard sitting next to him took the full force of
the blast and died instantly. A third man in the back of the vehicle was
also killed and a fourth was injured.
'What happened was terrible,' says Rathore, wincing from the pain of the two
pellets which are still lodged in his body. 'If this carries on it will be
impossible to save the tigers.'
The guards were attacked last April after being called out to track
suspected poachers on the edge of the Ranthambhore reserve in the hot
sandstone hills of southern Rajastan. After three days travelling from
village to village in search of information, they stumbled across three men
camping in a makeshift tent. They arrested two, but the third escaped.
On the way to back to their HQ, the guards stopped for a meal and a rest.
The delay proved fatal. The escaped poacher had got ahead of the guards and,
knowing the road they would have to take, had laid an ambush. Choosing a
steep-sided gorge, he rolled rocks into the road and hid behind the trees.
When the Jeep arrived, the poacher opened fire with a crude muzzle-loading
shotgun. Police later arrested a man and charged him with murder.
Poachers have long been active in India's reserves, hunting tigers, leopards
and other cats for their fur and small animals for meat. Most have been
villagers living near parks with few other means of support.
In the 1970s and 1980s, India had great success in protecting tigers through
a national campaign called Project Tiger, launched in 1973. From one year to
the next the numbers of Indian tigers went up.
From about 2,000 in 1973, India's tiger population rose to 4,300 by 1989,
out of an estimated world total of 6,000-7,000. Over the same period,
India's human population rose by 60 per cent and the economy doubled in
size. India's experience seemed to prove that even in a poor and
over-populated country, protection of the environment and economic
development were not incompatible.
Ranthambhore, the beautiful former hunting preserve of the maharajahs of
Jaipur, achieved particular fame because its tigers forsook traditional
habits and became active during the day - supposedly because they now felt
safe from man. The park, with its ancient forts, Moghul pavilions and lakes,
attracted plenty of tourists.
It was not until last year that conservationists realised that something was
seriously wrong - when reports indicated alarming declines in the numbers of
tigers at India's leading national parks.
At Ranthambhore, the tiger tally dropped from 45 in 1991 to 17 last year,
though the figure was revised this year to 28. For wildlife experts the
conclusion seemed inescapable: tigers were disappearing so fast that their
survival was at stake.
Experts were quick to identify the origin of the new threat - an upsurge in
demand for tiger bone for Chinese medicine. Chinese apothecaries believe
tiger bone has the power to restore energy and sexual prowess. Factories in
China, Taiwan and South Korea produce tens of thousands of bottles of tiger
bone medicine for sale in east Asia and in Chinese communities around the
world.
Conservationists say these factories have in the past used bone from Chinese
tigers, including a vast stock which was accumulated when over 1,000 tigers
were hunted and killed as pests in the 1950s in southern China.
In the last few years this stock seems to have run low, just at a time when
fast economic growth has created millions of new customers for tiger bone
medicine. The trade is quite open. Until recently apothecaries in Tihwa
Street in Taipei displayed tiger bones in their windows, selling at a retail
price of up to Dollars 1,500 per kilogramme.
The Huangshi Long March pharmaceutical factory in Hubei province, northern
China, puts a tiger emblem on its packets of musk and tiger-bone plasters
for use in treating rheumatism.
The first evidence of tigers being killed for their bones in India came in
1987 when poachers operating in the foothills of the Himalaya, in Uttar
Pradesh, were found to have discarded a skin. Proof came last year at
Ranthambhore when a local poacher named Gopal Mogya and an accomplice, a
meat trader, were caught on the edge of the park carrying a gun and a bag of
bones.
The police say that Mogya confessed to selling bones and skins to a butcher
in the nearby town of Sawai Madhopur. In turn, the butcher said he supplied
Mohamed Ashiq and Mohamed Ahmed, two brothers who own a tanning business in
Fatehpur, a centre of the leather industry, some 200 miles from Sawai
Madhopur.
Mohan Singh Bhati, the police superintendent at Sawai Madhopur, who
estimates that 14-18 tigers have been poached from Ranthambhore, says it is
the first time Indian police have broken such an extensive poaching ring.
From Fatehpur, the trail led to New Delhi where the police are investigating
several fur and skin traders but have made no further arrests. Wildlife
experts working for Traffic, a unit of the World Wide Fund for Nature, which
monitors trade in endangered species, say that Delhi is an important centre
for dealing in skins, bones and other products.
The principal traders are often Kashmiris, who have moved their businesses
to Delhi. Kashmiris have a tradition of fur-making; they also have
long-standing experience of trading with foreigners. They established
world-wide networks in the fur trade before international agreements in the
1970s suppressed the legitimate trade in wild animal products.
A few fur shops trade openly in New Delhi, for example in Yashwant Place, a
run-down shopping centre favoured by hawkers dealing in smuggled wrist
watches and Russian champagne. But Traffic's experts believe that most of
the skins are smuggled out of India, mainly to Kathmandu in Nepal, where
there is also a sizeable Kashmiri community.
Nepal, like India, has tough laws against trading wild animal skins, but
they are barely enforced. Tourists can easily buy coats made of leopard and
other skins in shops near big hotels. Traffic researchers who visited the
area last year counted 294 coats made from the skins of over 100 leopards,
14 clouded leopards and 2,500 other wild cats.
Traffic says tiger skins and bones are smuggled out of India by the same
route but are rarely seen because of the international publicity that tigers
attract. The bones are mostly ground into powder and carried by couriers
overland into Tibet or by air to Bangkok and Hong Kong. Vivek Menon, of
Traffic's Delhi office, says it is futile trying to estimate how much bone
is taken out of India. 'Very few people are arrested. And they are always
the minions.'
The conservationists' top priority is to try to stop the bone-related
poaching. India, Nepal and China are all signatories of the 1973 Convention
on Trade in Endangered Species, the main international agreement restricting
trade in wildlife.
In line with the convention, all these countries have passed tough laws
against trade in the products of endangered species. But enforcement varies
greatly. Even in India, which has a comparatively good record, there is a
loophole that allows traders in Kashmir to deal in skins taken from pre-1979
stocks.
Under pressure from conservationists, governments are starting to act. China
has announced plans for an east Asian wildlife protocol, an agreement to
restrict trade in wildlife, to be signed later this year by ministers from
east Asian countries. But it is difficult to see what benefits the protocol
will bring, other than to remind governments of their existing commitments.
Kamal Nath, the Indian minister for the environment and forests, says
protecting the tiger is an issue for all countries. 'We need help,' he says.
The help he has in mind is pressure on east Asian countries brought by the
US and other export markets.
Conservationists also believe that important changes are needed in the
running of the 19 reserves which now come under Project Tiger. These
reserves are the pick of India's wildlife parks, sanctuaries not only for
tigers but for numerous other species, including leopards, elephants and the
country's last surviving rhinoceroses. The decline in the numbers of tigers
has drawn attention to serious shortcomings in the management of these
parks.
Valmik Thapar, author of studies on the tigers of Ranthambhore, says the
only way forward is to involve local people more in the running of the park.
Former poachers would make good gamekeepers. Villagers could be encouraged
to work as forest guards. Informants could be paid for tips about poachers.
Without such efforts, the tiger may be doomed.

   Two decades ago, illusionists Siegfried &amp; Roy
were told to forget their dream of bringing their act to this
entertainment capital because ``magic doesn't work in Vegas.''
   Now, some 10,000 shows and tens of millions of dollars later,
they are the architects of one of America's hottest attractions,
the top draw in a city of stars, and are building on a dream to
save the rare white tiger.
   When Siegfried &amp; Roy take the stage at the Mirage Hotel Monday
night, it will mark the 10,000th live performance in the city they
have adopted as their home. By comparison, the longest running show
on Broadway, ``A Chorus Line,'' closed this year after 6,137
performances.
   Today Siegfried Fishbacher and Roy Horn rank No. 27 on Forbes
magazine's list of highest-paid performers, ahead of the likes of
Frank Sinatra, Tom Cruise and the rock group U2. They're forecast
to earn $28 million in the two-year period ending in December.
   But it was a different story 20 years ago when the two
illusionists, who met and formed their act on a cruise ship, tried
to break into the Las Vegas market.
   ``Don't tell me you're a magician because magic doesn't work in
Las Vegas,'' a jaded Tropicana Hotel official told the pair before
reluctantly giving them a short contract.
   ``All my confidence was gone,'' Siegfried said during an
interview at the pair's walled estate, where they keep a menagerie
of animals used in their act and breed white tigers. ``But when I
performed here the first time, I knew it was meant to be.''
   History has proven the pair right, and their performance is
proving Mirage owner Steve Wynn something of a prophet.
   Wynn announced three years ago he was signing the pair to a
$57.5 million, five-year contract as the star attraction when his
new $630 million Strip resort opened. The mammoth pact prompted
some skepticism of whether Wynn could make their magic pay.
   The skepticism was short-lived when Siegfried &amp; Roy began
packing the new 1,500-seat, $50 million Theatre Mirage two shows a
night Feb. 1. The show's producer, Kenneth Feld, said Siegfried &amp;
Roy will gross $30 million their first year at the Mirage.
   They spent eight months performing in Japan in 1988-89.
   ``The Japanese really spoiled us,'' Roy said, taking a break in
a breakfast room overlooking a pool where some of their white
tigers played. ``After one performance they continued to applaud
for an hour and eight minutes. It was unbelievable.''
   The performers returned from Japan for a record-breaking stint
at Radio City Music Hall in New York City before heading back to
Las Vegas.
   The extravagant, Broadway-type production mixes spectacular
illusions such as a woman appearing to be turned into a 750-pound
white tiger with singing and dancing by a 170-member cast. But the
show is not the only interest of the two stars.
   Preservation of the white tiger - a beautiful animal first
sighted in the Himalayas 200 years ago and now nearing extinction -
is a major goal for Siegfried &amp; Roy.
   In 1987, zoo officials said there were only about 100 white
tigers in the world. All were in captivity.
   ``The white tigers are our living legacy,'' Roy said. Their
collection of 23 whites, including five snow white tigers, is the
largest in the world. The performers have started an exchange
program with a West German zoo, and are working with the Cincinnati
Zoo on a white tiger breeding program.
   Six rare white tigers were born while the performers were in
Japan. Three of them, named Red, White and Blue, were born on July
4, 1989.
   The white tigers romp and swim at their compound, on the
northwest side of Las Vegas, and at an 80-acre ranch on the
outskirts of the city.
   The animals also spend some time, two or three at a time, in an
elaborate glassed-in habitat at the Mirage, where millions of
people have viewed the animals since the hotel opened in November
1989.
   Siegfried's most poignant memory?
   When two white tigers were born at the entertainers compound,
and their mother, Sitarra, placed each of the cubs in Roy's lap
after they were born - a touching display of trust between animal
and man.
   ``This was the most magical moment of my life,'' Siegfried said.

   A 450-pound Siberian tiger smashed through a
reinforced window Thursday, dragged a veteran Houston Zoo worker
into its outdoor area and mauled him to death, officials said.
   Ricardo Tovar, 59, apparently was peering through a
quarter-inch-thick glass-and-wire-mesh window when the tiger broke
through and pulled him outside, zoo director John Werler said. The
window was in a door leading from a hallway to the tigers' natural
habitat area outside.
   ``At this time and until there is more information, we cannot be
sure just how the accident happened,'' Werler said during a news
conference. No one saw or heard the attack.
   The 11-year-old male tiger, named Miguel, was isolated after the
attack but was not going to be destroyed because it is a member of
an endangered species, Werler said.
   Tovar, a 10-year zoo employee, was the first worker to die at
the zoo.
   John Gilbert, senior zookeeper of cats, said he realized that
something was wrong was about 7:45 a.m. when he called to his
co-worker ``and the tiger reared up and put his face into the
door.'' It was unclear how long the attack had gone undiscovered;
Tovar's shift began at 6 a.m.
   ``It cut him up and ate him up pretty good,'' Houston Fire
Department paramedic Howard Shaw said, adding that's much of
Tovar's left arm was torn away. ``He had numerous bites about him
and possibly a broken neck.''
   Tom Dieckow, curator of exhibits and leader of the zoo's
response team, fired a rifle into the ground three times to try and
scare the 11-year-old cat away from Tovar's body.
   Workers were finally able to force the animal back into its cage
with a fire extinguisher, Dieckow said.
   Zoo officials praised Tovar as a good employee.
   ``I've known him for 18 years. I worked with him at the San
Antonio Zoo. He was very competent. He knew his job,'' said Nelson
Herwig, a friend of Tovar's and curator of the zoo's aquarium for
10 years.
   The tiger was aggressive, Wehler said. ``It snarls and growls,
and we have some cats that have neither of those dispositions,'' he
said.
   But he said the tiger poses no threat to the public because
there are three doors between the public's area and the tigers'
area.
   Because the Siberian tiger is an endangered species, the zoo
would have to get federal permission to kill it, Herwig said.
   The Siberian tiger is the largest of eight kinds of tigers and
can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds.

<HEAD>Zoo to Mate Again Rare Tiger That Strangled Cub</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zoo officials say they will again mate a rare
Sumatran tiger that apparently accidentally strangled her
2-month-old cub while zoo visitors watched in horror.
   ``It even occurs in the wild. The mother doesn't usually kill
the cub intentionally _ just through accident or neglect,'' said
Ronald Tilson, the Minnesota Zoo's director of conservation, who
studies Asian tigers.
   The cub, named Shere-Kahn, died Sunday at the Lowry Park Zoo
after the mother, Tuka, apparently picked him up wrong. Her jaws
nearly surrounded the cub's neck, cutting off his air supply. An
autopsy showed the cub died because his windpipe was blocked, said
David Thompson, zoo director.
   Shere-Kahn was Tuka's first offspring and zoo personnel
attributed the death to her lack of experience as a mother.
   Shere-Kahn was the first Sumatran tiger born in captivity in the
United States this year. Now, 32 of the rare orange and black
striped animals live in captivity in this country. An estimated 600
to 800 exist in the wild, only on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
   Zoo officials said they would breed the 11-year-old Tuka again,
but they're considering hand-raising the next litter.
   Witnesses told curator Lex Salibsury that Tuka and Shere-Kahn
were frolicking in a moat when the 150-pound adult cat grabbed her
16-pound cub by the throat, then dragged it through the water.
   Zoo keepers lured Tuka into a cage and grabbed the unconscious
cub, and tried unsuccessfully to revive it with mouth-to-mouth
resusciation.
   ``It was very sad. People were just sobbing,'' said Michael
Hoad, who was visiting the park when it happened.
   The incident prompted zoo keepers to start monitoring another
new mother, Kariz, a Persian leopard who gave birth to three cubs
on March 6.

<LEADPARA>  WITH its nasty horns and tank-like demeanor, the rhinoceros doesn't look like
it needs coddling. But scientists say it will take massive amounts of money
and research -- and soon -- to save the burly beast from extinction.;   
Prized for its horns, which fetch up to $27,000 a pound on the black market,
the rhino is a sort of walking Fort Knox that can be protected only at great
expense. Its life in the wild is threatened by an army of poachers, war in
Africa, logging in Indonesia and land-hungry settlers.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IS IT SUNSET FOR THE RHINO?
AS NUMBERS DROP, SCIENTISTS RACE TO AVERT
ITS EXTINCTION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Fewer than 11,000 rhinos now roam Africa and Asia, divided into hundreds of
populations -- many of them so small that they are considered doomed.;   
Alarmed by the animal's sharp decline, researchers are keeping more than 1,000
rhinos in captivity, hoping to breed them for release into the wild.;    But
even the most successful breeding programs are going so slowly that it may
take 70 years to produce enough animals for release; by that time, key pieces
of rhino habitat may vanish.;    Meanwhile, the remaining wild rhinos are
being moved to protected areas, often surrounded by fences and patrolled by
armed guards. Some sanctuaries are managed like "megazoos," where animals are
swapped between groups to promote breeding and increase genetic diversity.;   
All of this is costly: $200 to $400 to defend 250 acres of a preserve,
$180,000 to capture a rhino and $15,000 a year to keep it captive. The Third
World countries where most rhinos live find it especially difficult to come up
with the money.;    And scientists say conservation is also hampered by a dire
lack of information on the rhino's reproduction, nutrition, habits and
health.;    More than 300 researchers met in San Diego last week for the first
international conference to consider conservation of all five species of
rhino.;     They reported small successes: the resurgence of some rhino
species in a few countries. Better handling techniques that should reduce
rhino deaths in captivity. The discovery that rhinos communicate in
frequencies too low for human hearing -- a fact that could be used to
manipulate their behavior.;    But the overall mood was grim.;    Black rhino
populations have dropped 98 percent in the past 20 years. Only 28 northern
white rhinos, 75 Javan and 800 Sumatran rhinos remain in the wild; all are
considered critically endangered.;    In one bit of good news, the southern
subspecies of white rhino has increased 89 percent over the past decade to
some 4,800 animals today -- the result of intensive protection and management
in South Africa.;    In addition to fences and patrols, some countries have
taken more drastic protective measures. Poachers are shot on sight in Kenya;
in Namibia, rhinos are dehorned to make them less attractive.;    Rhino horn
is coveted;    Even so, poaching takes a relentless toll. Although rhino horn
is no longer sold extensively for dagger handles in Yemen, it's still popular
throughout Asia as an ingredient in traditional medicines. A recent study in
Hong Kong showed that it is, in fact, effective against fever in rats --
although conservationists point out that other cures work just as well.;    In
China, drug manufacturers are even grinding up antique rhino-horn cups worth
tens of thousands of dollars, according to Esmond Bradley Martin, an
investigator for the World Wildlife Fund.;    "It's just something horrific,"
Bradley Martin told the conference. The cups "are magnificent works of art. It
shows you to what extent people will go in getting rhino horn.";   
Conservationists agree that the best strategy for saving the rhino is to keep
it in the wild, where it breeds faster and serves as an "umbrella species" to
protect large areas of land full of other important plants and animals.;   
But they're also intensifying efforts to breed the animals in captivity,
hoping to ensure the survival of key genetic traits in case wild populations
are wiped out.;    Scientists at the conference described their efforts to
collect and freeze semen samples from captive rhinos -- the heart of an
eventual sperm bank that would preserve genes for reintroduction in future
generations.;    Genetic studies;     Researchers are just starting to do the
first genetic studies on rhinos -- important for gauging the genetic health of
populations as well as determining relationships between individual animals.; 
  At Harvard University, archaeologist Nikolaas van der Merwe is developing
tests that measure distinctive patterns of isotopes in rhino horn. The tests
reveal which species the horn is from, he said, and he eventually may be able
to identify the region the animal came from, perhaps helping police track down
poachers.;    The method could also help in monitoring the trade in rhino horn
if it is ever legalized, he said.;    Countries want to sell horns; 
Representatives of both South Africa and Zimbabwe said they plan to ask next
spring for a loosening of the international ban on trading the horns.
Together, the two countries have stockpiles of confiscated horn worth tens of
millions of dollars -- money that could be used to further protect the
surviving animals.;    But the idea is controversial, and other experts at the
conference said it could encourage more poaching and a further decline of
rhinos in other countries.;    Researchers have also made some progress in
tracking down the cause of hemolytic anemia, a bursting of red blood cells
that has killed at least nine captive black rhinoceroses, said David Jessup, a
veterinarian for the California Department of Fish and Game in Sacramento. He
belongs to International Wildlife Veterinary Service, a volunteer organization
based in Salinas that raises money to support wildlife research.;    The group
has helped identify one possible cause of the anemia, a bacterium called
Leptospirosis, Jessup said. Many captive rhinos are now vaccinated against
five strains of this bug.;    The group also discovered that wild animals have
much more vitamin E in their systems than captive ones, he said; researchers
are trying to develop nutritional supplements to correct the imbalance.;    In
Virginia, a high school marching band set off a study that could have profound
implications for understanding rhino behavior.;    It happened two years ago
during Zoo Day at Virginia Zoological Park in Norfolk, when the band marched
past the rhino enclosure playing oom-pah music.;    "The rhinos got quite
excited and initiated what the keepers described as courtship behavior," said
Joseph Daniel, dean of the college of sciences at Old Dominion University.;   
When it happened again last year, Daniel suggested that one of his students,
Elizabeth von Muggenthaler, go to the zoo and record rhino utterances. She
discovered that rhinos, like elephants, do a lot of communicating in tones too
deep for humans to hear -- even lower than the oom-pah of a tuba.;    These
deep sounds probably carry long distances, Daniel said, and may be useful in
calling animals together, finding and courting mates and other important
social interactions. Some exchanges between rhinos even seem to have a
conversational tone.;    Does this mean they're smarter than we thought?;   
Not necessarily, Daniel said.;    But he added, "By God, rhinos have been a
success for 60 million years. Is that a mark of stupidity? Just because rhinos
do not convey, by the brilliance of their eyes, intelligence, doesn't mean
there is not sensitivity there."  </TEXT>

   Ten Florida panthers are about to be chosen for a
new life that may have extraordinary consequences for the survival
of the species.
   A captive breeding program has been approved by federal and
state officials to boost the declining population from an estimated
30 to 50 in the wild.
   ``There are certain purists that say, `Let them die a natural
death out in the wild,' '' said John Christian of the Fish and
Wildlife Service. ``We need to consider their views, but on the
other hand we are charged with preventing the extinction of the
species and moving toward its recovery.''
   Wildlife managers say the panther is in nowhere near the danger
of the California condor or the black-footed ferret when their
entire populations were rounded up for breeding, but Dennis Jordan,
the Fish and Wildlife Service's panther coordinator, said, ``It's
no question the population is stressed.
   ``When you get down to a total population numbering 30 to 50
animals, you get into a situation of facing the brink of
extinction. We consider we have one viable sustaining population
now in South Florida and none anywhere else.''
   The nocturnal cougar subspecies, growing to 60 to 130 pounds, is
smaller and darker than most cougars and has a distinctive tail
crook and a cowlick in the middle of its back. It's a solitary
hunter favoring deer and small game and needs lots of room _ at
least 40 square miles for a female and more than 200 square miles
for each male, with little overlap.
   The panther once ranged from Louisiana to South Carolina, but
hunting and development have pushed it into the Everglades and
undeveloped South Florida interior. Without intervention, experts
say it will vanish within 40 years.
   The goal of the program is 500 breeding adults in captivity and
three wild colonies in 20 years using high-tech influences, such as
radio-telemetry collars and possibly even in vitro fertilization
and embryo implants.
   With captive breeding, four founders _ adults at the top of
distinct family trees _ and six kittens chosen for their bloodlines
will be captured and sent to Miami's MetroZoo, the private White
Oak Plantation, Tampa's Lowrey Park Zoo or the Jacksonville zoo in
March or April. Big cats in captivity tend to be prolific breeders,
but researchers have no solid experience with panthers.
   Panthers will be captured for six years. Descendants of the
first batch captured could be freed to the wild in three to seven
years through a ``halfway house'' that would teach them to hunt
again. A team of state wildlife workers already checks about 15
cats equipped with radio collars each year.
   Once the cats are chosen, they will be chased up a tree and
tranquilized. The sedated cat will then be roped and lowered to the
ground, cushioned against injury by an air bag. During medical
exams, the cats will be kept under a tent to protect them from the
sun. The breeding cats then will be taken to a central station for
evaluation and eventually to their new zoo homes.
   ``Everybody has philosophical views about these kinds of things.
I'm sure everyone would like to see the cat do well in the wild,''
said Larry Thompson, Southeast regional vice president of the
National Audubon Society. ``But short of that, what we're going to
have to do is bring some of the cats in and carry through with this
phase of planning.''
   Captive breeding is only one step in a wide-ranging program to
revitalize the panther population. A National Cancer Institute
researcher is doing genetic kinship studies; the National Zoo is
experimenting with in vitro fertilization in domestic cats; state
guidelines for oil and gas development and hunting regulations have
been modified to protect the panther; culverts have been built
under Interstate 75 to keep the cats off the road across the
Everglades; and intense monitoring of the wild population will
continue.
   ``The uniqueness of this plan for panthers is we still have this
wild population,'' said Tom Logan, the state wildlife research
program coordinator. ``This is not a situation where we have to do
it or we're going to lose them in the next year or two, in other
words a last-step effort.
   ``We're a step ahead of the game.''

   One of the first red wolves to produce
offspring since the endangered species was reintroduced to the wild
has died, and her mate apparently has taken charge of the
9-week-old pup, officials said Wednesday.
   The wolf, thought to have succumbed to disease or infection, was
discovered Saturday at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge
near Manteo, said refuge manager John Taylor.
   The pup was nowhere to be found. But two days later, a wildlife
team spotted it trotting alongside its father in the 140,000-acre
refuge, Taylor said.
   ``We are fortunate that the puppy had been weaned already,'' he
said, adding that it was unusual for male wolves to take care of
their offspring.
   He said the male wolf apparently had been feeding the puppy the
way the mother would _ by killing and eating raccoons, rabbits and
other small animals and regurgitating the soft gruel.
   ``It's cute _ it looks like a little dog puppy, only it's kind
of mottle-colored, mostly reddish with spots of gray,'' Taylor
said. ``We thought the prospects of our finding (it) alive were
slim.''
   The female wolf was among four pairs of red wolves released into
the wild in September as part of a federal effort to save the
species. The animals were declared extinct in the wild in 1980.
   The newly orphaned pup was first spotted May 21, and another pup
was sighted soon afterward with different parents _ marking the
first time a species previously extinct in the wild has produced
offspring after being returned to its natural environment.
   Although litters average five or six pups, scientists believe no
more than one survived from either of the two litters.
   The red wolf once roamed the Southeast in large numbers. But in
1978, with the species teetering near extinction, the last pure red
wolves were taken from the wild to a zoo in Tacoma, Wash. There,
breeding in captivity encouraged biologists to try reintroducing
the animals into the wild.
   At Alligator River, wildlife teams take trips into the wild
every other day to track the adult wolves via radio collars worn by
the animals, Taylor said.

  [Text] Taipei, March 29 (CNA) -- Taiwan will send 
representatives to a United Nations-sponsored meeting on illicit 
trade and consumption of endangered animals schduled to be held 
in Beijing in May, a government official said Tuesday [29 March]. 
  ``We'll only attend the non-government organization (NGO) 
sessions of the UN's Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES),'' said Huang Ying-jay, a department 
chief at the Council of Agriculture (COA). 
  The NGO sessions are open to non-CITES members. Taiwan is 
not a member of the UN wildlife conservation organization. 
  The 16-18 May CITES meeting will focus on how to eliminate 
the use of bear bile in Chinese medicines, Huang said. Several 
bear species native to Asia face the threat of extinction. 
  ``We'll detail our conservation programs for indigenous 
Taiwan bears and other endangered wild animals at the NGO 
sessions,'' Huang explained. He added that Taiwan will not send 
representatives to a CITES meeting on illicit flora trade 
scheduled for 16-19 May in Mexico. 
  Taiwan for the first time attended the NGO essions held in 
Geneva earlier this month in connection with a CITES Standing 
Committee meeting. It also managed to escape immediate CITES 
trade sanctions for its alleged failure to stamp out tiger bone 
and rhino horn trade. 
  The UN organization agreed to give Taiwan more time to 
improve its wildlife conservation measures, and will decide 
whether to impose trade sanctions on Taiwan in November, when 
all CITES members will meet. 
  The United States has agreed to follow the CITES decision 
and 
wait for some time before deciding whether to retaliate against 
Taiwan in accordance with the [word indistinct] legislation 
meant to protect wildlife. 
  The U.S. has also asked Taiwan to send reports on its 
conservation programs for some Asian indigenous animals, 
including black bears and orangutans, before 25 April, the 
sources said.

<TEXT>
   It wasn't love at first bite for two rare
Sumatran tigers matched through an animal-mating computer service,
but zoo officials here are confident the affair will blossom with
time.
   Dutch, a 4-year-old male from Blidorp Zoo in Rotterdam, Holland,
met German-born Tuka, 10, on Monday in the tiger display at the
Lowry Park Zoological Garden.
   The two initially faced off warily. Tuka growled. Dutch took a
swim.
   ``She's snarling in a defensive posture,'' explained zoo curator
Lex Salisbury. ``They could fight, but other tiger introductions
have been pretty good.''
   The tigers are indigenous to the Asian island of Sumatra and
number about 700 in the wild, said Salisbury. Seventy of the
endangered animals are in captivity; 50 of those live in North
American zoos.
   The tigers are hunted for their rich orange-and-black striped
coats, and are being pushed out of their forest habitat by
development.
   Dutch was donated to the zoo May 11, and Tuka was loaned
indefinitely six months ago by the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   The matchmaker was the American Association of Zoological Parks
and Aquariums in Apple Valley, Minn.
   Its 3-year-old computer program is called ARKS (Animal Record
Keeping System).
   One goal is to reintroduce babies produced by computer couples
back into the wild, Salisbury said.
   Before their first date, the tigers had only sniffed each other
``nose to nose'' in separate cages, Salisbury said.
   ``It may be a while before they warm up, and before they mate,''
Salisbury said, after Dutch ignored Tuka to plunge into a moat.
``They could breed tomorrow or a few months from now. There's also a
remote chance that they won't breed at all.''

<LEADPARA>  Eleven black-footed ferrets, members of what five years ago was North
America's most endangered mammal species, have entered an animal-kingdom
version of boot camp, a period of intensive training in how to kill and
survive in the wild.;    Next fall, the first ferrets to graduate from this
final phase of the government's captive breeding program at the Cheyenne
Mountain Zoo will start returning to the wild, resuming the fight with prairie
dogs, predators and humanity that they almost lost last time around, said
Galen Buterbaugh, regional director of the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  PRAIRIE DOGS, BEWARE! FERRETS MAKE COMEBACK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     One part of humanity has already started fighting. The Wyoming Farm Bureau
Federation in November adopted a resolution demanding that the agency rethink
its plans to release the ferrets in the state because their presence would
hinder agriculture.;    Five years ago only 18 black-footed ferrets were left
on earth, all living around Meeteetse, Wyo. Last week there were 185. By the
time breeding season ends in late April, federal experts say they think
they'll have 300 to 500 ferrets, enough to risk a return to the wild even in
the face of objections from Wyoming ranchers.;    First found in the Great
Plains in 1851, the animals ranged from southern Canada to Texas until cattle
ranchers began eradicating prairie dogs, the sole food for the fierce and
voracious ferrets.;    By 1974, the black-footed ferret was believed extinct.
But in 1984, after search teams found a colony of 129 ferrets, federal
wildlife officials announced the agency was keeping the endangered population
under close surveillance.;    But when the first creatures are returned to the
wild next fall, Buterbaugh said, "Then the going is going to get real tough
once again.";    Wildlife experts warn, for example, that they expect heavy
losses once the animals return to nature because they will face many of the
same predators -- horned owls, hawks, eagles, coyotes, badgers and cougars --
that led to their near extinction.;    Serious questions also remain about
whether ferrets raised in the relative tranquillity of a zoo will have the
ability to survive on their own. In the wild, adult ferrets teach their young
to enter the pitch-black burrows built by the prairie dogs and to overpower
their prey in extremely violent fights with tooth and claw.;    Paul
Mountville, marketing and development director of the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo,
said the ferrets would be trained to fight and to kill animals for food.;   
"In nature their sole source of food is prairie dogs that they hunt and kill
in their burrows," Mountville explained. "So here we'll start them with
something small, like maybe mice or hamsters or gerbils, and work them up to
prairie dogs."  </TEXT>

   WANTED: Big, beautiful beast, one of
last of dying breed, as possible mate for same. Serious inquiries
only.
   That's the pitch a group of zoologists is making to zookeepers
around the country. Their matchmaking service, a sort of modern-day
Noah's Ark, could be the last hope for many wild animals facing
extinction.
   This ark is fashioned from computer software and cooperation.
   Through it, a black rhino calf was born in Detroit to a mother
swapped from Oklahoma City whose seven previous offspring had lived
less than a month. ``Logistically, it was difficult and expensive,''
said Doris Applebaum, registrar at the Detroit Zoological Park. She
said the switch cost around $6,000, but ``it was well worth it.''
The calf, born in March, was doing well on Tuesday, Applebaum said.
   The black rhino is declining at a rate of 97 percent per
generation, said Nathan Flesness, director of International Species
Information System, which compiles data for the animal swapping
program. The animal's population has plummeted from 70,000 in 1970
to about 3,000 today, and captivity may be the key to its
preservation.
   ``Humans shoot them to sell their horns for enough to retire on
for the rest of their life,'' said Flesness.
   The program, with headquarters here in the Minnesota Zoo, is
called the Species Survival Plan. It was set up by the American
Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums in 1980 with a goal
not only of matching animals, but also of convincing zookeepers that
donating or swapping some of their most prized possessions is in the
long-term interest of their profession.
   Fifty species _ including the gorilla, cheetah and thick-billed
parrot _ so far have climbed aboard the computer ark. Thomas Foose,
the program's coordinator, says he hopes that number will increase
tenfold by the start of the next century.
   The choice of species to include usually comes down to ``the big
and the beautiful,'' said Flesness. ``It's a long way short of
everything, but it's a lot better than doing nothing.''
   Foose's group tracks data, including genealogy and medical
history, compiled by the ISIS on over 96,000 living vertebrate
specimens in 347 zoos and 32 countries.
   Foose says that as a result of the gorilla program, for example,
there is less inbreeding and healthier babies are being born. About
15 gorillas have been born a year for the last 10 years with the
population presently at about 300. ``We've gone from a situation
where that population was declining to one where it's increasing by
about 2 or 3 percent a year,'' he said. ``That's very healthy.''
   Gorilla mating is difficult since long-established pairs tend to
treat each other like brother and sister.
   The solution, Flesness said, is just a plane ride away: ``Put one
of the two partners on airplanes, switch them to another zoo, and
let them make friends.''
   While conservationists once had misgivings about keeping exotic
animals in captivity, they now are realizing the role zoos can play
in preservation, said Flesness.
   Wildlife managers, he said, increasingly realize they have a
small population and that it is often in one place. ``They want to
take their species into captivity for insurance reasons, and they
suddenly move into the same arena, the same set of challenges as
zoos.''
   The Puerto Rican parrot is an example. Forty-three of the birds
exist in the wild on the island, and an equal number live in
captivity there.
   ``If one bad hurricane comes, they'll not only wipe out the wild
birds but at least endanger the ones in the aviary,'' said Flesness.
Conservationists, he said, have agreed that a few of the animals
should be moved to a mainland zoo.
   The prospects of easing animals back into the wild look bleak, he
said, as long as humans keep encroaching on their natural habitat.
   ``The species that are going to make it out there are the ones
that can handle lots of bulldozers, highway disturbance, and little
teeny spots of semi-wild land left,'' he said.
   ``The big ones are the ones that are ... going to go unless we do
something radically different. What's surprising is that they're
going to go in our lifetime.''

  [Text] Beijing, Feb 5 (AFP)--China, facing sanctions for 
not cracking down on trade in endangered species, seemed to have 
won some breathing space Saturday after a top international 
wildlife protection official said some progress had been made. 
  ``We were very encouraged by what we saw,'' Murray Hosking, 
standing committee chairman of the UN Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) told AFP. 
  However, Hosking, who left here Saturday after a four-day 
visit at the head of a CITES delegation, indicated that while 
the Chinese authorities had taken important steps to counter the 
illegal trade in rhinoceros horns and tiger bones, question 
marks remained over enforcement. 
  ``The policing mechanisms they have set up are as good as 
any, but the important thing now is that they are seen to 
work,'' he said. 
  CITES launched a scathing attack on Taiwan and China in 
September for not enforcing restrictions and called on its 120 
members to consider punitive sanctions ``up to and including the 
prohibition of trade in wildlife'' against both. 
  China reponded in November by issuing a total ban on the 
trade in rhino horns and tiger bones, including their use in 
traditional Chinese medicine. 
  Although Hosking declined to give specific details of the 
delegation's findings, he described the report that he would 
take back to the CITES standing committee as ``positive.'' 
  The committee will study the report before deciding whether 
to go ahead with the sanctions threat. 
  According to Hosking, China has agreed to carry out 
nationwide inspections of pharmaceutical companies and outlets 
this year and in 1995 to ensure the trade ban is being adhered 
to. 
  ``The government must make sure that the policing is done 
visibly. Above all, it has to make it clear to the companies 
that it is serious,'' he said. 
  However, he acknowledged that the use of animal parts in 
Chinese medicine was a deeply ingrained tradition that would 
take time to break. 
  ``You cannot change the cultural traditions of 1.2 billion 
people overnight.''

<HEAD>Zoo Director Lashes Out At Report About Hunger At Beijing Zoo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of the country's largest zoo denies
a Chinese newspaper report that inflation has stopped his tigers
from eating live chicken and his elephants from munching bananas.
   Beijing Zoo director Feng Youlian was quoted in Tuesday's
edition of the Guangming Daily as saying his animals have ``never
known hunger.''
   He criticized an Aug. 8 report in the official, English-language
China Daily, that said the 3,000 animals, birds and fish at the zoo
have fallen on lean days because of inadequate funding and sharp
rises in food prices.
   The China Daily report said elephants were forced to eat carrots
instead of their favorite, bananas. And it said tigers, lions and
other carnivores were once treated twice weekly to a live chicken,
now feast on such delicacies only when they are sick.
   ``Even during the `three difficult years,' our animals have
never known hunger,'' Feng said, referring to a famine that hit
China from 1960 to 1963.
   ``Many animals at the zoo are presents from heads of foreign
countries and some are rare animals on the brink of extinction,''
he was quoted as saying. ``As a result, we can cut down on other
things but one thing that won't drop is the amount we spend on the
animals' food.''
   Inflation ``could affect some capital construction projects,''
Feng said, ``but never the stomachs of our beasts.''
   Feng said the zoo received $176,000 from the government for
non-staple foods in 1985. That figure jumped to $189,000 in 1987.
   He said that since 1965, the goverment's subsidy to the zoo has
grown 12 times although the number of animals has only doubled.
   In addition, he added, the zoo's entrance fee of 10 fen (less
than a nickel) has not been raised in 38 years.
   China is currently facing its highest inflation since 1949 when
the communist government was established. Prices in June of this
year were 19 percent higher than they were in the same period last
year.
   Non-staple food items, such as vegetables, fish and meat have
increased the most, some by as much as 60 percent over the past
year.
   Feng acknowledged that the China Daily report was correct in
saying that tigers, lions and other big cats were forced to fast
one day a week. But he said that policy has been in effect since
1954.
   ``Their stomach capacity is very large,'' zoo worker Zhang Gaopu
told the Guangming Daily. ``They can go without eating for several
days.''
   Feng also acknowledged that lately the zoo has been substituting
cheaper items for more expensive ones to save money.
   But, he said, ``if the more expensive food is the favorite food
of the animal, then we will guarantee that food no matter what the
cost.''

<TEXT>
   Helicopters carrying water-filled ``Bambi
buckets'' have helped officials control a fire that threatened to
destroy the world's first project to restore rare captive monkeys
to the wild in Brazil.
   ``We were probably days away from the extinction of a species,''
said Benjamin Beck, associate director of the National Zoo in
Washington, D.C.
   The fire was fought with two helicopters belonging to the
Brazilian federal police. When a call came to Washington alerting
Beck to the fire, the Friends of the National Zoo and Wildlife
Preservation Trust of Philadelphia immediately raised $6,000 to
send two ``Bambi buckets'' to the reserve, Beck said Thursday.
   ``From the time the request came to me, until they were in use
in Brazil, was less than 72 hours,'' he said.
   A Bambi bucket, Beck explained, is a large vessel that hangs
beneath the helicopter and allows the aircraft to dip into bodies
of water, without landing, and drop the water on the fire.
   ``The fire is, we feel, under control, but it's still burning
deep in turf in the swamps,'' Beck said.
   Enough organic matter and oxygen are available to keep the fire
smouldering, he said, adding:
   ``If it gets dry and windy, it can break out at any time.''
   The National Zoo has been coordinating a project to breed the
highly endangered golden lion tamarins and return them to the Poco
das Antas reserve in Brazil, about 75 miles northeast of Rio de
Janeiro.
   The fire broke out about Feb. 2 at Poco das Antas, home to about
400 tamarins. They make up about 80 percent of the remaining wild
population, Beck said.
   Sonia Rigueira of Conservation International in Washington said
the fire burned about a week. ``They lost control for a while, and
then they got the helicopters,'' she said in a telephone interview
from Brazil.
   The fire was confined to the grassy areas that make up about
half of the reserve, she said. The other half _ mature forest where
the tamarins live _ was undisturbed, she said.
   ``Had the fire progressed into the mature forest, we would have
seen this species come to extinction,'' said Beck.
   The golden lion tamarin is a cat-size primate with a leonine
mane and bright, burnt-orange fur. It is native to Brazil's
Atlantic coastal forest, which once covered Brazil's eastern flank
but is now reduced to patches comprising only a few percent of its
original size.
   ``It is a beautiful and interesting primate,'' Beck said. ``But
probably more important is, if it can survive, virtually the entire
ecosystem can survive.''
   The golden lion tamarin is what biologists call a flagship
species. Its survival depends on the health of the ecosystem it
lives in.
   Saving the golden lion tamarin is inextricably linked with
saving what remains of the Atlantic coastal forest, a unique region
brimming with plants and animals that live nowhere else on Earth,
Beck said.
   The animals and the reserve could not have been saved without
the effort by Brazil, Beck said.
   ``We ought to give credit to a tremendous response by Brazilian
authorities,'' he said.

   A Michigan exhibition of two rare giant pandas
from China might harm the species, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service said Monday in refusing permission to import the animals.
   The Pandarama exhibit, sponsored by Michigan United Conservation
Clubs and the state Department of Natural Resources, would have
displayed the animals for 100 days this summer at the Michigan
State Fairgrounds in Detroit.
   Under an agreement with China's Sichuan Province, the exhibitors
would pay at least $300,000 for the loan of the pandas, and the
money would be used to build a panda captive-breeding facility and
to improve wild pandas' natural habitat.
   ``There are some risks to the species from the loan which are
not adequately outweighed by the potential benefits,'' the Fish and
Wildlife decision said. ``A reduction in the threat of extinction
from this import cannot be demonstrated from the information in the
record.''
   The decision said expansion of facilities for breeding pandas in
captivity ``could lead to the removal of additional animals from
the wild to stock it.''
   The two pandas proposed for the Michigan exhibit are already
living in captivity in the Chendu Zoo.
   Under an international treaty, pandas born in 1984 and after
cannot be imported without a permit. Fewer than 1,000 giant pandas
are thought to exist.
   A spokesman for Michigan United Conservation Clubs, Don Stypula,
said the agency's ruling was ``preposterous'' and the exhibit's
organizers would appeal through administrative channels.
   ``We're wondering now how the Chinese are going to react to
this,'' Stypula said. ``This is a slap in the face to them, more so
than to us.''
   The Fish and Wildlife decision came amid efforts by the World
Wildlife Fund and the American Association of Zoological Parks and
Aquariums, to close an exhibition of two Chinese pandas in Toledo,
Ohio.
   After the Fish and Wildlife Service granted permission for the
Toledo exhibition, the animal preservation groups sued in federal
court in Washington. They argued that the Fish and Wildlife Service
failed to determine that the pandas weren't imported for commercial
purposes and that their display would promote survival of the
species. Both are criteria for issuing an import permit.
   The Toledo Zoo argued that closing the exhibit would deny the
public a chance to see the endangered species and to learn
something about China. Zoo attorneys also said closing the
exhibition could harm international relations between the United
States and China.
   David Klinger, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service,
said the agency found ``a more conclusive demonstration of benefit
to the species in the Toledo case.''
   The decision also said having an exhibition in Detroit at the
same time one was under way in nearby Toledo would reduce the
educational benefits.
   Backers of the Toledo exhibit reached agreement for the loan
with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, which is
affiliated with China's national government.
   The Michigan organizers dealt with official bodies in Sichuan
Province, where most wild pandas live. The provincial authorities
in turn handled contacts with China's national government, Stypula
said.
   William Reilly, president of the World Wildlife Fund, praised
the denial of the Michigan permit. ``Short-term loans of giant
pandas to the United States were out of control,'' he said.
``Economic incentives simply cannot be allowed to drive American
zoos and amusement parks to import pandas.''

   The Cincinnati Zoo has kept dozens of
antelopes, cows and tigers in an 8-by-8-foot storage closet for
nearly nine years.
   But now, one of the world's largest collections of frozen animal
embryos has outgrown its laboratory, and the zoo has begun work on
a $3.4 million facility expected to open in 14 months.
Groundbreaking was Saturday.
   Dr. Betsy Dresser, director of the zoo's Center for Reproduction
and Endangered Wildlife, is counting on the 16,000-square-foot lab
to help save animals from extinction.
   ``It's a safety net,'' she said. ``Instead of feeding a herd of
rhinoceroses, you can keep them frozen.''
   The ``frozen zoo'' preserves species' genetic material while
conservationists try to save their habitat or find room for them in
captivity.
   ``If we had been able to do this for the dinosaurs, we could
bring them back today,'' she said.
   Despite the limitations of working in the converted mop closet,
she said the frozen zoo has produced 14 world firsts since the
project started in 1981. One was the birth in February of a rare
Indian desert cat through test-tube fertilization of a house cat.
   Successes have spawned similar research programs in San Diego,
Washington and London.
   ``Cincinnati is leading the way,'' said Thomas Foose,
conservation director for the American Association of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums in Bethesda, Md. ``This type of research is
crucial to the survival of a lot of species.''
   Private grants and fund drives will pay for the new center,
which will accommodate up to 50 scientists. Ms. Dresser said
officials hope to encourage scientific as well as financial
interest by offering tours to visitors.

<LEADPARA>  Trade in endangered animals to hunt and kill is a nationwide business, and
zoos are prime sources of exotic animals that end up in private hands, says a
Washington, D.C.-based investigator for the Humane Society of the United
States who has been studying the problem for a year.;    "There absolutely is
a black market in these animals, and there's big money involved -- $100,000 in
one case where a tiger was sold at auction," Humane Society investigator Lisa
Landres said. "These animals get in the hands of people who will sell them to
anyone."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BIG BUCKS FIND EXOTIC ANIMALS
ZOOS CAN'T TRACK SURPLUS BEASTS THAT OFTEN
GO TO HUNTING RANCHES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Directors of zoos in San Francisco and Los Angeles acknowledged in
interviews that they have no legal say in what happens to the animals they
sell, and while most zoos have in the last six months enacted policies to
monitor initial sale of the animal, they say it is almost impossible to follow
them until their lives end.;    Last week, ranchers who charged hunters to
shoot tigers, leopards, jaguars and mountain lions on their Monterey County
property were named in a 38-count criminal complaint. Investigators say some
of the animals, killed less than 100 feet from their cages, may have come from
zoos.;     Tigers came from Arizona;  Dawn Patterson, one of two owners of
Patterson Ranch in Lockwood, told investigators last spring that an animal
dealer from Arizona delivered two Bengal tigers, a leopard and other exotic
animals to the ranch.;    How rare cats end up on such hunting ranches is a
subject of debate, with zoological societies asserting that surplus zoo
animals are sold only to reputable dealers, while wildlife experts and animal
rights groups say it is precisely the dealers that are the loophole through
which surplus animals can slip -- to wildlife auctions, uncertified private
collections and private hunting parks.;    Older animals no longer suitable
for breeding are unwanted by many zoos -- which try to trade them to their
fellow institutions. But "there isn't much call for old tigers, that's true,"
said Michael Dee, mammal curator at the Los Angeles Zoo. "We're not always
successful.";     No guarantees;  That is when the animals are put up to
dealers for sale -- often to reputable brokers whom zoo keepers trust to place
the animals with other zoos or in licensed private collections. But it is
uncommon for a zoo to track subsequent sales of the animal, and no federal
agency does it for them. As a result there are no guarantees some animals
won't end up as hunters' prey.;    The Los Angeles Zoo last spring initiated a
policy to track the fates of animals they sell by checking with the buyers
every six months, and requiring buyers to report if they resell them.;    The
San Francisco Zoo had no policy to track the animals it sells until Feb. 21,
when it passed a policy to monitor the animals through one transaction after
they leave the zoo and to mandate that the animal is not sent directly to a
shooting ranch or to be used for invasive research. But the zoo's oversight
ends there.;     Time running out;  Zoo officials said two of the 10 surplus
breeds of cats the zoo has now were earmarked for a Sonoma County animal
dealer they trust. Officials hope to place the others in zoos, but because the
San Francisco Zoo is short of space, time to find new homes is limited.;    "A
lot of these animals are old animals and no one is going to take them," said
Sandra Keller, president of a San Francisco group called Citizens for a Better
Zoo. "Buster the jaguar is 17 years old. What's going to happen to him?";   
Assistant Zoo Director Dave Robinett said that if no homes were found for the
animals in the next year, they could be sold to dealers.;    "I don't think
it's fail-safe, but we have to sell to the type of individual who we feel
comfortable won't get the animals in these kinds of situations," Robinett
said. "Ultimately, yes, there is a possibility that after a few transactions
it could go that route (to a hunting ranch).";    Few big cats not placed; 
But Robinett and other zoo professionals said placing the blame for supplying
exotic animals to hunting ranches solely on accredited zoos misses the mark.; 
  The number of surplus zoo animals not placed with other zoos is, they say,
relatively small. At the San Francisco Zoo, for example, only three big cats
were sold last year -- to other zoos. In Los Angeles, no big cat breeds were
listed as surplus in the past year.;    According to the American Association
of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, there are about 150 small, unmonitored zoos
in the United States, many of them roadside menageries.;    Other animal
users;  In addition, there are private ranches where exotic animals are bred
and hunted, private collectors who keep animals such as tigers as pets,
Hollywood animal trainers who need a specific animal for a limited period of
time, and smugglers who bring endangered species into the country.;   
"Somebody has got these animals somewhere, and they've had them for a long
time," Dee said. "It only takes one pair of tigers to get in the wrong hands
and they could be producing offspring left and right.";    The 159 zoos in the
United States that are considered professional by experts in the field have
gotten together to manage the breeding, control and sale of endangered species
in recent years -- sharing information on gene pools of the animals they have
between them and vowing to breed animals in a natural environment and not to
raise more than their zoos need.;    Zoos have a conflict;  But the very
commitment zoos have to breeding endangered species often comes into conflict
with the limited amount of exhibition space that zoos have, said Robinett.
Zoos can't afford to build new cages for all the new animals they breed -- or
to keep aging animals long past their breeding and display years.;    At some
zoos, the problem is changing exhibits. Curators at the San Francisco Zoo are
hoping to focus their future exhibition space on just two breeds of cats --
the Persian and snow leopards.;    Their plans leave no room for the tigers,
jungle cats, lions, jaguars, a Siberian lynx and a black leopard on display
now.;    Curators say they are confident those animals will end up in suitable
homes, but when it comes to the fate of endangered animals, they are the first
to say there are no guarantees.;     Evidence in Oklahoma;  Federal
investigators say they're pushing hard to find the origins of the animals
killed at the Patterson Ranch and others like it. In Oklahoma, where state
Fish and Game agents raided a game preserve in October that charged hunters up
to $5,000 to shoot endangered animals in a fenced area, investigators say they
have documented evidence that the animals killed came from zoos.;    But Sam
Cottrell, a state ranger with the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife
Conservation, said the specifics of the investigation will not be made public
for months to come. And here in California, investigators say they have at
least a year's worth of work before they track down the origins of the animals
shot in the southwestern corner of Monterey County.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Siberian Tiger Breaks Through Glass Window, Kills Zookeeper</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 450-pound Siberian tiger that smashed through a
reinforced window at the Houston Zoo and killed a zookeeper poses
no threat to visitors and won't be destroyed, officials say.
   ``We can contain that cat,'' zoo director John Werler said
Thursday following zookeeper Ricardo Tovar's death, the first of
its kind at the zoo.
   The big cat apparently broke through a 2{-foot-square,
quarter-inch-thick glass-and-wire mesh window in a door, then
dragged Tovar, 59, into its natural habitat area and mauled him to
death, Werler said.
   Tovar, a 10-year zoo employee, had apparently been peering
through the window from a hallway. There were no witnesses to the
attack, and it was unclear how long it had gone undiscovered.
Tovar's shift began at 6 a.m.
   John Gilbert, senior zookeeper of cats, said he realized that
something was wrong around 7:45 a.m. when he called to Tovar ``and
the tiger reared up and put his face into the door.'' He radioed
for help.
   A response team headed by Curator of Exhibits Tom Dieckow
arrived five minutes later.
   Dieckow said he fired a shot from his rifle, which made the
animal drop Tovar. He fired two more shots in an effort to scare
the 11-year-old cat away from the zookeeper's body.
   Workers were finally able to force the animal back into its cage
with a fire extinguisher, Dieckow said.
   ``It cut him (Tovar) up and ate him up pretty good,'' Fire
Department paramedic Howard Shaw said, adding that much of Tovar's
left arm was torn away. ``He had numerous bites about him and
possibly a broken neck.''
   The tiger, named Miguel, will not be destroyed because it is a
member of an endangered species, Werler said.
   Werler said the animal is aggressive. ``It snarls and growls and
we have some cats that have neither of those dispositions,'' he
said.
   Tovar had been in charge of large cats since 1985.
   ``He was very competent. He knew his job,'' said Nelson Herwig,
a friend of Tovar and curator of the zoo aquarium for 10 years.
   The tiger display, which houses two other Siberian tigers, was
closed to the public Thursday.
   Visitors, including hundreds of school children, were delayed
entrance into the zoo by 30 minutes.
   ``Lots of parents have been calling, saying their children are
at the zoo with their school and want to make sure everything is
all right,'' said Cathy Kuntz, a zoo secretary.
   Werler said the tiger posed no threat to the public because it
would have to get through three doors to reach visitors.
   The Siberian tiger is the largest of eight kinds of tigers. It
can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds.
