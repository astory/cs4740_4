TELEVISION / LARRY STEWART: BOWL GAME LINEUP: TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there is such a thing as too much football. 
</P>
<P>
Seven bowl games on New Year's Day is about four too many. 
</P>
<P>
While the NFL presents a nice, neat postseason tournament, what the colleges 
present is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Try watching seven games within an 11-hour span. It's enough to make your head 
spin worse than any New Year's Day hangover. 
</P>
<P>
The first game Monday was the Hall of Fame Bowl game. NBC had to cut away from 
its coverage of the Rose Parade, but at least it didn't run into the 
overlapping problems that ABC did. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame Bowl game ended, NBC wasted little time switching to the 
Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It was nice and clean, far better than ABC's switch from the Florida Citrus 
Bowl game to the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
ABC took its time making the switch. ABC started off by showing a promotional 
spot for the upcoming Rose Bowl game. Thanks, but we knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a promo for ABC Sports, then a 'thank-you" promo to an airline that 
provides it with free travel. Then there were two promos for ABC shows, 
followed by a news brief. 
</P>
<P>
What next? Three consecutive commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, an introduction for the Rose Bowl game, followed by a taped interview 
with Bo Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Then came more ABC Sports graphics and two more commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, by the way, the Cotton Bowl on CBS was still going on. Arkansas scored on a 
long pass play and after a failed two-point conversion attempt, the Razorbacks 
trailed Tennessee, 31-27, with 1:29 left. 
</P>
<P>
OK, we were finally going to see the Rose Bowl game kickoff, right? Nah. 
</P>
<P>
First there was a Big Ten promo, more ABC graphics and then finally a glimpse 
of the Rose Bowl, where the crowd was finishing singing the National Anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Then came an introduction from announcer Keith Jackson, and another taped piece 
on Schembechler, this one showing a 1971 pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Next was another commercial, then a Pacific 10 promo followed by one more 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
The teams finally took the field, and Jackson and commentator Bob Griese then 
offered a little pregame analysis, as if there already hadn't been enough. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Fiesta Bowl game, Florida State missed a field-goal attempt 
and trailed Nebraska, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Rose Bowl game kickoff came, 18 minutes after the end of the 
Citrus Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
One play after the kickoff at the Rose Bowl game, Florida State recovered a 
fumble to set up its first touchdown to tie the score on the way to a rout of 
the Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
At least we were down to only two games, the Cotton Bowl game having ended. 
</P>
<P>
It was quite a task trying to watch the Hall of Fame, the Citrus and the Cotton 
Bowl games all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The Cotton Bowl game was the last of the three early games to start. 
</P>
<P>
The Citrus Bowl game began shortly after ABC went from Pasadena to Orlando, 
Fla.But it didn't take long to realize there was going to be a time squeeze 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Citrus Bowl game announcer Gary Bender sensed it. As officials 
discussed a first-quarter penalty, Bender said: "Come on, fellas, we've got a 
lot of football to play today." 
</P>
<P>
If you happened to be watching the Hall of Fame Bowl game you saw Ohio State's 
Zack Dumas level Auburn's Stacy Danley. 
</P>
<P>
Announcer Don Criqui first said: "That's got to be the hardest hit of the 
'89-90 bowl season." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after viewing a replay, Criqui said: "It's the hardest hit I've seen in 
football in years." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it was. 
</P>
<P>
A little later in the game, Criqui, talking about Auburn's Shayne Wasden's punt 
returns of 30 and 34 yards, said they broke the Orange Bowl game record. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you can't blame Criqui for being confused. He worked the last eight 
Orange Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of flubs, O.J. Simpson, during halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl game, 
referred to Notre Dame's George Gipp as George Kemp, or something like that. 
However, Simpson did catch the mistake and corrected himself. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to Gipp's death, comparing it to the death of Colorado quarterback 
Sal Aunese, Simpson said it occurred a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
NBC colleague Bob Costas, fearing Simpson's attempt at sarcasm was probably 
lost on most viewers, added: "It was more than a few years ago. It was so long 
ago that a young Ronald Reagan could play Gipp (in the 1940 movie, 'The Knute 
Rockne All-American')." 
</P>
<P>
During halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl game, Gayle Gardner -- yes, she still 
works for NBC -- did a nice taped interview with Miami Coach Dennis Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
And Gardner, during halftime of the Fiesta Bowl game, offered an excellent 
feature on the once-troubled Colorado football program and the death of Aunese 
this past September. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, meanwhile, deserves kudos for a halftime segment it showed during the 
Cotton Bowl. It chronicled the highlights of college football during the 1980s, 
including California's 1982 kickoff return against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
NBC broke a story that Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez would 
become coach at Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
The network had Ralph Wiley interview Alvarez later in the day, but because of 
technical problems, had to cut away from it earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
On this long day and night of football, the overall coverage and the announcing 
was fine. 
</P>
<P>
But something needs to be done about the logjam. The way things are now, it's 
impossible to see everything. 
</P>
<P>
Just trying is a real job -- and no fun.

MELVIN DURSLAG: A CRAZY EIGHT IS TOO MUCH FOR ONE TV SCREEN; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE OVERABUNDANCE OF BOWL GAMES ON NEW YEAR'S DAY MAKES IT 
IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH THEM ALL. WHO CAME UP WITH THIS SYSTEM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inspecting the bowl football program on New Year's Day, you have a vision of 
herring in a net, flopping over one another. 
</P>
<P>
The current lineup embraces eight games, running from 8:30 in the morning (PST) 
until roughly 8:30 at night. 
</P>
<P>
You are surprised the genii of college football have stopped at eight games. 
Between midnight and 8 a.m., they could book two more. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, they could squeeze in another in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, they have arranged so many games Jan. 1 that an overlap occurs. For 
instance, the Citrus Bowl, the Cotton Bowl and the Hall of Fame Bowl poach on 
each other's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
And all three arrive on the air at some time during the second half of the 
Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Bowl and the Sugar Bowl overlap, same as the Fiesta Bowl and the 
Rose Bowl. And all are coming off a previous day of activity featuring the John 
Hancock Bowl and the Domino's Pizza Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
A confused viewer of those two could leave his set believing he will be insured 
in 30 minutes, or the policy is free. 
</P>
<P>
You are a tolerant individual. You are patient and understanding, the milk of 
human kindness flowing by the liter through every vein. 
</P>
<P>
You are not aiming to rock the vessel. All you are trying to comprehend is 
whether college football has gone foaming-at-the-mouth mad. 
</P>
<P>
One isn't supposed to be dealing here with dummies. This is our highest 
intellectual order, the teachers of our young. 
</P>
<P>
And they allow a circumstance on New Year's Day calling for eight televised 
bowl games? 
</P>
<P>
If smart guys permit this excess, what would imbeciles do? 
</P>
<P>
So what has all this done to that spectacle billing itself as "the Granddaddy 
of 'Em All," the Rose Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
What it has done is reduce the Rose Bowl to selling nothing but age -- a game 
beginning in 1902 and continuing to the present, with intermittent stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1902 game, for instance, it stopped until 1916, substituting that 
well-known ghetto sport, polo. It also tried chariot races. 
</P>
<P>
And then the Rose Bowl ground to a halt in Pasadena in 1942 when the game was 
shifted to Durham, N.C. It was a war year, and Pasadena feared an air attack by 
the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
What an insult to the Luftwaffe to OK the game on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was once the premier postseason game, the Rose Bowl has suffered 
serious slippage, not at the box office, but in the television ratings and in 
general prestige. 
</P>
<P>
And the ultimate contempt has been the willingness of other bowls to go 
head-and-head with it on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Offering Washington and Iowa this time, the Rose Bowl needn't necessarily 
apologize. Washington, on a good day, can knock off any amateur team in the 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
And Iowa is better than average. 
</P>
<P>
But it has become increasingly rare that connoisseurs about the land judge the 
Rose Bowl as an event of major national impact. It is more a parochial little 
war between the Pacific 10 and the Big Ten, pretty much like Eton and Harrow. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Rose Bowl still dredges more money from television than any other 
bowl game -- that could be a fleeting condition -- it behooves the promoters 
each year to capture participants of muscle, teams with substantial followings. 
</P>
<P>
Those teams preferred are USC, UCLA, Michigan and Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and Iowa are rated fair. What ABC lives in fear of is, say, Oregon 
State vs. Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Bucking seven other games New Year's Day, with such a matchup the network 
starts looking for a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
One is available in Pasadena, making the Rose Bowl a game of convenience, if 
nothing else.

USC BEATS BO IN HIS LAST ROSE BOWL, 17-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ricky Ervins scored on a 14-yard run with 1:10 to play, lifting 12th-ranked USC 
to a 17-10 victory over third-ranked Michigan in the Rose Bowl game at Pasadena 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Schembechler, in his last game as Michigan's coach, closed his career with a 
2-8 record in Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans finished the season 9-2-1; Michigan is 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's other bowl games: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Peter Tom Willis threw for 422 yards and five touchdowns, both Fiesta Bowl 
records, as fifth-ranked Florida State routed No. 6 Nebraska 41-17 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The victory capped a 10-2 season for Florida State, which won its final 10 
games. Nebraska also finished at 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst overall loss for Nebraska since Oklahoma beat the Cornhuskers 
38-7 in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chuck Webb ran for 250 yards, the second-best rushing performance in Cotton 
Bowl history, as eighth-ranked Tennessee beat 10th-ranked Arkansas, 31-27, at 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, a freshman, carried 26 times and scored twice, including a 78-yard run. 
Rice's Dicky Maegle set the Cotton Bowl record of 265 yards against Alabama in 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee finished with an 11-1 record; Arkansas is 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reggie Slack completed his last 12 passes before halftime and led 
ninth-ranked Auburn to a 31-14 victory over 21st-ranked Ohio State in the Hall 
of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
After suffering two interceptions, Slack threw touchdown passes of 11 and 4 
yards to Greg Taylor that gave the Tigers the lead for good. Greg Frey, 
quarterback for Ohio State, was sacked four times. Auburn finished at 10-2, 
Ohio State at 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the Citrus Bowl at Orlando, Fla., Jeff George passed for a season-high 
321 yards and three touchdowns as 11th-ranked Illinois defeated 15th-ranked 
Virginia, 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first bowl game victory for the Illini (11-2) since their 17-7 win 
over Washington in the 1964 Rose Bowl. The Cavaliers finished at 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
The final rankings in the Associated Press poll will be released today.

USC DEFEATED; IRISH, UCLA WIN IN BOWLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notre Dame staked a claim to its 14th national football championship, and the 
roses went to Michigan as the glut of college bowls wound up with an 
extravaganza of seven games Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Fighting Irish completed the first 12-0 season in their storied 
football history with a 34-21 victory over third-ranked, previously undefeated 
West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl at Tempe, Ariz., and the No. 11-ranked 
Woverines rallied in the second half to beat fifth-ranked USC, 22-14, in the 
75th Rose Bowl at Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-ranked UCLA upheld the honor of the Pacific 10 Conference, winning a 
record seventh straight bowl game by downing eighth-ranked Arkansas, 17-3, in 
the Cotton Bowl at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clemson Beats Oklahoma 
</P>
<P>
In other games, No. 13 Clemson beat No. 10 Oklahoma, 13-6, in the Citrus Bowl 
at Orlando, Fla., and No. 17 Syracuse dominated No. 16 Louisiana State, 23-10, 
in the Hall of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In night games, No. 2 Miami played No. 6 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl at Miami, 
and No. 4 Florida State faced No. 7 Auburn in the Sugar Bowl at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame will likely receive its first national title since 1977 today when 
the Associated Press' final poll of the media is released. Coach Lou Holtz will 
join Irish coaches Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian and Dan Devine in winning 
national titles in their third seasons at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy won in 1943, 1946, 1947 and 1949, Parseghian in 1966 and 1973, and Devine 
in 1977. Knute Rockne won 6 other national titles before the AP poll began in 
1936. 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Tony Rice led the way for Notre Dame, passing for 2 
touchdowns and a career-high 213 yards. Rice also rushed for 75 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame built a 23-6 half-time lead, and West Virginia (11-1) had to settle 
for the first 11-victory season in its 96-year football history. 
</P>
<P>
USC (10-2) had a 14-3 half-time lead but was overpowered by Michigan (9-2-1) in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler only his second victory in nine 
trips to the Rose Bowl and marked the first time the Big Ten had won 
consecutive Rose Bowls since the 1964-65 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State defeated USC, 20-17, last year. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan fullback Leroy Hoard rushed for 142 yards and scored two 
fourth-quarter touchdowns. Hoard put the Wolverines ahead, 15-14, with a 1-yard 
touchdown run early in the final period, then locked up the victory with 
another 1-yard scoring run with 1:52 left. He set up the last touchdown with a 
61-yard gain to the Trojan 9. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rodney Peete, frustrated most of the game by the Michigan defense, 
scored for USC on runs of 1 and 4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) used the efficiency of quarterback Troy Aikman and an overpowering 
defense to become the first school ever to win bowl games in 7 consecutive 
seasons -- all with Terry Donahue as coach -- before a partisan Arkansas crowd 
of 74,304. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' victory streak also includes 3 Rose Bowls, a Fiesta Bowl, an Aloha 
Bowl and a Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman completed 19 of 27 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown, and converted 
12 of 20 third-down situations into first downs. Freshman Shawn Wills gained 
121 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys are expected to make Aikman their first pick of the National 
Football League draft. Cowboy personnel director Gil Brandt congratulated 
Aikman under the goal posts after the game. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was the UCLA defense that carried the day, holding Arkansas (10-2) 
to 42 yards of offense and 4 first downs.

MELVIN DURSLAG: GRANDDAD GETTING BOWLED OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way life measures up in matters postseason, Michigan or Ohio State or 
Illinois will be matched against USC in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, which produces an inordinate amount of cash to televise the game, exhales 
deeply. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, heaven," it says. "But for this blessing, it could have been 
Washington State and Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to cutthroat New Year's Day football, now featuring seven games, 
the network doing the Rose Bowl is made to perspire, no longer sitting atop an 
automatic hit. 
</P>
<P>
Faded elegance, the Rose Bowl rarely offers the prime game, meaning those who 
promote it, or televise it, must hope, at least, for principals with wide 
followings. 
</P>
<P>
On the West Coast, that would be USC and UCLA. In the Big Ten, it would be 
Michigan and Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
But competition in the leagues has so deteriorated that the Rose Bowl, locked 
in with the two, is beginning to lose the carbonation that has given fizz to 
its match for so long. 
</P>
<P>
Normally today, you write off half the teams, or more, in each conference at 
the start of the season. And, by the end, you are looking pretty much at the 
same colors, mostly belonging to USC and UCLA on one side and Michigan and Ohio 
State on the other. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, USC will have graced the scene three years in a row. And an audit 
discloses that over the last 20 years, the visiting force has been Michigan or 
Ohio State 16 times. 
</P>
<P>
The monotony suggests a period in Texas in which all the bit shooters drove 
Cadillacs. You never asked a man what kind of car he bought. You merely 
inquired, "What color?" 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl bills itself as the Granddaddy of Them All, a tribute more to its 
age than its impact. It sells out, almost unfailingly, and its financial health 
is good. 
</P>
<P>
But all too often on the New Year's card, it is the tap dancer supplementing 
the headline act. In vaudeville, Fink's Mules warmed up audiences as the Rose 
Bowl does today. 
</P>
<P>
Little old ladies in Pasadena don't like it. Over gin the other day, one was 
heard to grumble: "We are being upstaged by something called the Federal 
Express Orange Bowl. What the hell is the Federal Express Orange Bowl?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you sure it isn't pony express?" another asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Pony express may be sponsoring a game in Fresno." 
</P>
<P>
Operating the only major postseason game that is totally committed to two 
conferences, the Rose Bowl shuts itself off from teams that may be interesting 
that particular season. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't have to enter the dogfight," the Rose Bowl explains. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it doesn't. And, sidestepping the dogfight, it has wound up in the 
water closet, with TV ratings that have slipped and with such contempt 
developed by competitors for the Granddaddy of Them All that they have dared 
take it on, head to head, on the air. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, who would have been so audacious, so consummately brassy as to 
overlap the Rose Bowl? Would some hillbilly try to win a singing contest from 
Pavarotti? 
</P>
<P>
"Look," you say gingerly to Pasadena. "Maybe the time has come to forget the 
lock-in and start thinking about the dogfight. Rose Bowl money can lick a lot 
of dogs." 
</P>
<P>
"We cherish our relationship with the Big Ten and Pacific 10," Pasadena lashes 
back. "It has stood since 1947." 
</P>
<P>
"A newspaper we remember stood since 1903," Pasadena is reminded. "It isn't 
with us anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"But our two conferences have stature and they have character," Pasadena 
responds. "They embody everything that is good in institutions of learning." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you selling learning or football?" you reply. "This is show business. And 
the same teams coming in every year are getting to be a yawn. Do you know what 
killed the six-day bike race? Its act never changed. And the same thing one day 
will kill Old Faithful at Yellowstone." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena used to be more inventive. Offering its first bowl game in 1902, it 
shut it down as bad theater when Michigan creamed Stanford, 49-0. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know what Pasadena came up with the next year? A polo match. That seemed 
a good idea, inasmuch as no team, up to that point, had lost 49-0 in polo. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena then tried an ostrich race, followed by a race between a camel and an 
elephant. It also came on with a tug of war, which, today, might be called the 
John Hancock Tug of War. And, by 1916, it was ready again for football. 
</P>
<P>
In postseason play, the Rose Bowl is sitting in on a high-stakes poker game. To 
succeed, folks there must produce more than a fund of happy recollections on 
how the pot used to be theirs.

USC DEFEATED; IRISH, UCLA WIN IN BOWLS

Notre Dame staked a claim to its 14th national football championship, and the 
roses went to Michigan as the glut of college bowls wound up with an 
extravaganza of seven games Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Fighting Irish completed the first 12-0 season in their storied 
football history with a 34-21 victory over third-ranked, previously undefeated 
West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl at Tempe, Ariz., and the 11th-ranked 
Wolverines rallied in the second half to beat fifth-ranked USC, 22-14, in the 
75th Rose Bowl at Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-ranked UCLA upheld the honor of the Pacific 10 Conference, winning a 
record seventh straight bowl game by downing eighth-ranked Arkansas, 17-3, in 
the Cotton Bowl at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Miami, Florida State Win 
</P>
<P>
In night games, No. 2 Miami, which lost only to Notre Dame, routed No. 6 
Nebraska, 23-3, in the Orange Bowl at Miami, and No. 4 Florida State held off 
No. 7 Auburn, 13-7, in the Sugar Bowl at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
In other games, No. 13 Clemson beat No. 10 Oklahoma, 13-6, in the Florida 
Citrus Bowl at Orlando, Fla., and No. 17 Syracuse dominated No. 16 Louisiana 
State, 23-10, in the Hall of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame will likely receive its first national title since 1977 today when 
the Associated Press' final poll of the media is released. Coach Lou Holtz will 
join Irish coaches Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian and Dan Devine in winning 
national titles in their third seasons at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy won in 1943, 1946, 1947 and 1949, Parseghian in 1966 and 1973, and Devine 
in 1977. Knute Rockne won six other national titles before the AP poll began in 
1936. 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Tony Rice led the way for Notre Dame, passing for two 
touchdowns and a career-high 213 yards. Rice also rushed for 75 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame built a 23-6 half-time lead, and West Virginia (11-1) had to settle 
for the first 11-victory season in its 96-year football history. 
</P>
<P>
USC (10-2) had a 14-3 half-time lead but was overpowered by Michigan (9-2-1) in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Victory in Nine Trips 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler only his second victory in nine 
trips to the Rose Bowl and marked the first time the Big Ten had won 
consecutive Rose Bowls since the 1964-65 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State defeated USC, 20-17, last year. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan fullback Leroy Hoard rushed for 142 yards and scored two 
fourth-quarter touchdowns. Hoard put the Wolverines ahead, 15-14, with a 1-yard 
touchdown run early in the final period, then locked up the victory with 
another 1-yard scoring run with 1:52 left. He set up the last touchdown with a 
61-yard gain to the Trojan 9. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rodney Peete, frustrated most of the game by the Michigan defense, 
scored for USC on runs of 1 and 4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) used the efficiency of quarterback Troy Aikman and an overpowering 
defense to become the first school ever to win bowl games in seven consecutive 
seasons -- all with Terry Donahue as coach -- before a partisan Arkansas crowd 
of 74,304. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Bowls Involved 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' victory streak also includes three Rose Bowls, a Fiesta Bowl, an 
Aloha Bowl and a Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman completed 19 of 27 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown, and converted 
12 of 20 third-down situations into first downs. Freshman Shawn Wills gained 
121 yards in 18 carries against the Razorbacks (10-2). 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys are expected to make Aikman the first player chosen in the 
National Football League draft. Cowboy personnel director Gil Brandt 
congratulated Aikman under the goal posts after the game. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was the UCLA defense that carried the day, holding Arkansas to 42 
yards of offense and four first downs.

FIESTA BOWL DEFEATS ROSE BOWL IN TV RATINGS RACE, 17.0 TO 10.8

<P>
NBC's telecast of the Fiesta Bowl football game between national champion Notre 
Dame and West Virginia on Jan. 2 drew a 17.0 national rating, the highest of 
any bowl game this year, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
Playing opposite the Fiesta Bowl, ABC's Rose Bowl had a 10.8 rating, lowest in 
the television history of the game, NBC said. 
</P>
<P>
The rating means an average of 17% of all U.S. TV households were tuned into 
the Fiesta Bowl, or about 15.4 million households. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fiesta Bowl, of course, was for the national championship, and it was the 
highest-rated of the year, facing what traditionally is the highest-rated bowl 
game," NBC research specialist Gray Seamans said. "And we beat it handily -- by 
57%." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Cotton Bowl, in which UCLA defeated Arkansas, drew a 9.8 rating, lowest in 
its history, and the Hall of Fame Bowl on NBC had an 8.1. The Citrus Bowl, on 
ABC, had a 7.2 rating. 
</P>
<P>
National ratings were announced earlier for NBC's Orange Bowl, 12.8, and ABC's 
Sugar Bowl, 8.1, which were shown against one another in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Seamans said the highest-rated bowl game ever was the Orange Bowl's national 
championship showdown 2 years ago, which had a 25.1 rating.

A BIG DAY FOR BOWL GAMES AND PARADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LINAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's an especially big day for football bowl games, but what about those who 
love a parade? 
</P>
<P>
At 8 a.m., the TV networks and local stations both will serve up live coverage 
of the 100th "Tournament of Roses Parade" from Pasadena. The grand marshal is 
Shirley Temple Black, who also presided over the event 50 years ago in 1939 
when she was a child star. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will be shown on CBS (where the hosts will be Patrick Duffy and Joan 
Van Ark); NBC (Alex Trebek and Phylicia Rashad); ABC (Jim McKay and Joan 
Lunden); KTLA Channel 5 (Bob Eubanks and Stephanie Edwards); KTTV Channel 11 (a 
3-D telecast with Bill Welsh and Mary Hart) and KMEX Channel 34 (Jessi Losada 
and Maria Elena Salinas). 
</P>
<P>
There are also chances to catch the parade later in the day on repeat 
telecasts: at 10:30 a.m. (5)(11), at 6 p.m. (11) and at 7:30 p.m. (5). 
</P>
<P>
Dallas also boasts a New Year's Parade, and CBS will be there to cover the 32nd 
annual "Cotton Bowl Parade" from 2-3 p.m. (2)(8). 
</P>
<P>
Moving to the football field, here's a listing of the day's bowl games: 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Fame: LSU (8-3) vs. Syracuse (9-2), 10 a.m. (4)(36)(39). 
</P>
<P>
Cotton: UCLA (9-2) vs. Arkansas (10-1), 10:30 a.m. (2)(8). 
</P>
<P>
Citrus: Clemson (9-2) vs. Oklahoma (9-2), 10:30 a.m. (7)(3)(10)(42). 
</P>
<P>
Fiesta: Notre Dame (11-0) vs. West Virginia (11-0), 1:30 p.m. (4)(36)(39). 
</P>
<P>
Rose: USC (10-1) vs. Michigan (8-2-1), 1:45 p.m. (7)(3)(10)(42). 
</P>
<P>
Orange: Miami (10-1) vs. Nebraska (11-1), 5 p.m. (4)(36)(39). 
</P>
<P>
Sugar: Auburn (10-1) vs. Florida State (10-1), 5:30 p.m. (7)(3)(10)(42). STEVE

TELEVISION: A HARD DAY'S NIGHT OF FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there can be too much football. 
</P>
<P>
There was some good football on New Year's Day -- particularly for USC, Notre 
Dame and Miami fans -- but seven games in one day is about four too many. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL presents a nice, neat postseason tournament, culminating with Super 
Bowl Sunday. What the colleges present is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Watching seven games within an 11-hour span is enough to make your head spin 
more than a New Year's Day hangover. 
</P>
<P>
The first game Monday was the Hall of Fame Bowl, which began shortly after 10 
a.m. The last one, the Sugar Bowl, didn't end until 9:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
ABC made the most of its late sign-off and asked viewers to call in their votes 
for the No. 1 team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
At last count, Notre Dame had a pretty healthy lead over Miami, 55% to 26%, 
after 50,000 calls. 
</P>
<P>
NBC and ABC each televised three games and CBS one. 
</P>
<P>
NBC got a head start on ABC with the Hall of Fame Bowl starting a half-hour 
earlier than the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
NBC had to cut away from its coverage of the Rose Parade a little early, but at 
least it didn't run into the overlapping problems later in the day that ABC 
did. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's Hall of Fame Bowl ended at 1:27 p.m. and the network wasted little time 
switching to the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It was a far better switch than ABC's from the Citrus Bowl to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC planned to be on the air from Pasadena at 1:45 p.m., and the kickoff was 
scheduled for shortly after 2. 
</P>
<P>
But, as things turned out, the kickoff was delayed until 2:21. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the delay was that the Citrus Bowl didn't end until 2:03. 
Then, making matters worse, ABC took its time making the switch, to say the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
After the Citrus Bowl was over, ABC showed a promotional spot for the upcoming 
Rose Bowl. Thanks, but we knew it was coming. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a promo for ABC Sports, then a "thank you" promotional spot to an 
airline that provides free air travel. 
</P>
<P>
There were two promos for ABC shows, followed by a news brief. 
</P>
<P>
It was almost 2:10. 
</P>
<P>
What next? Three consecutive commercials and a Channel 7 promo for Todd 
Donoho's "New Year's Live" postgame show. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Donoho's show wasn't bad. He played it pretty straight, and his 
look-a-likes segment was interesting. John Robinson and Duke Snider was one of 
his best. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, ABC was still a long way from the Rose Bowl kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
After some ABC Sports graphics, there was a Big Ten promo, then more graphics 
and finally a glimpse of the Rose Bowl, where the crowd was completing the 
national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Then came an intro from announcer Keith Jackson and another taped piece on 
Schembechler, this one showing a 1971 pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
Next was another commercial, then a Pacific 10 promo followed by one more 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:16, the teams took the field, and Jackson and commentator Bob Griese 
offered a little pregame analysis. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl kickoff came 18 minutes after the end of the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
ABC had met with Rose Bowl officials at about 1 p.m. and asked for a later 
kickoff, so the teams knew what was coming. 
</P>
<P>
But it was unnerving to viewers at home and fans at the game, making them wait 
and wait. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-minute break wouldn't have been so bad had ABC not crammed in all those 
commercials and promos. 
</P>
<P>
There were 20 minutes between the Fiesta Bowl and Orange Bowl on NBC, but that 
network used the time mostly for analysis and features. 
</P>
<P>
It used the time for only a few commercials and promos. 
</P>
<P>
ABC producer Bob Goodrich, who was in charge of the Rose Bowl coverage, had 
plenty of material planned for his pregame show, but someone higher up at ABC 
decided against using it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Goodrich, director Larry Kamm, announcers Jackson and Griese and the 
rest of the ABC crew put out an excellent Rose Bowl telecast -- once it got 
going. 
</P>
<P>
ABC got some definitive shots the holding call on Michigan's fake punt in the 
fourth quarter, but the most conclusive shot wasn't shown until halftime of the 
Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It showed that Michigan's Bobby Abrams held, but it was far away from the play 
and the flag was late. 
</P>
<P>
Usually sideline reporters offer little, but NBC's O.J. Simpson came up with 
some good information during the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, working the Colorado sideline while Ralph Wiley handled the Notre Dame 
bench, explained why the entire teams of both schools went on the field before 
the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said when the Colorado players saw the whole Notre Dame team coming 
out, they did the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson also explained what went wrong on Colorado's fake field goal try early 
in the game, pointing out that the key receiver forgot to run a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange Bowl booth, Dick Enberg and Bill Walsh had one of their best 
games. It was refreshing to hear how excited Walsh was. 
</P>
<P>
He even apologized for a profanity. Actually, all he said was 'that was a 
helluva play." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers of the Hall of Fame Bowl saw one of the all-time hits when Ohio State's 
Zack Dumas leveled Auburn's Stacy Danley. 
</P>
<P>
Announcer Don Criqui first said: "That's got to be the hardest hit of the 
'89-90 bowl season." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after viewing a replay, Criqui said: "It's the hardest hit I've seen in 
football in years." 
</P>
<P>
Criqui at one point forgot he was at the Hall of Fame Bowl. Talking about 
Auburn's Shayne Wasden's punt returns of 30 and 34 yards, he said they broke 
the Orange Bowl record. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe you can't blame Criqui for being confused. He worked the last eight 
Orange Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of flubs, Simpson, during halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl, referred 
to Notre Dame's George Gipp as George Kemp. However, Simpson did catch the 
mistake and corrected it. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to Gipp's death, comparing it to the death of Colorado quarterback 
Sal Aunese, Simpson said it occurred a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Colleague Bob Costas, fearing Simpson's attempt at sarcasm was probably lost on 
most viewers, added: "It was more than a few years ago. It was so long ago that 
a young Ronald Reagan could play Gipp (in the 1940 movie, 'Knute Rockne -- All 
American')." 
</P>
<P>
During halftime of the Fiesta Bowl, Gayle Gardner -- yes, she still works for 
NBC -- had an excellent feature on the once-troubled Colorado football program 
and the death of Aunese last September. 
</P>
<P>
CBS deserves kudos for the halftime piece it showed during the Cotton Bowl. It 
chronicled the highlights of college football during the 1980s, including 
California's 1982 kickoff against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
NBC broke a story Monday afternoon that Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry 
Alvarez would be leaving the school to become head coach at Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
The network had Wiley interview Alvarez later in the day, but because of 
technical problems, had to cut away from it earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
On this day and night of football, the coverage and the announcing, overall, 
was fine. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that something needs to be done about the logjam. The way things are 
now, it's impossible to see everything. 
</P>
<P>
And that's depriving viewers. You don't see the NFL scheduling seven games on 
Super Bowl Sunday.

<LEADPARA>  For those needing an early jump on their New Year's Day plans, the options may
include watching Cal's football team.;   The Bears, for now, are being watched
by executives from the upper tier of Jan. 1 games -- the Fiesta, Orange,
Florida Citrus and Sugar bowls -- with executives of less prestigious games --
the Hall of Fame is one -- ready to step in if the bigger bowls lose interest.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  IT'S NOT TOO EARLY FOR CAL FANS TO THINK ABOUT NEW
YEAR'S DAY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Granted, the distinction of playing on New Year's Day has lost some of its
luster with eight -- yes, eight -- bowl games on the day's schedule. So to say
Cal could be playing in a New Year's Day bowl game, as Brent Musburger did
during Cal's 24-17 loss to Washington, still begs for some narrowing of the
scope.;   The only way to glean a Rose Bowl invitation, of course, is to win
the Pacific 10 Conference championship, which appears headed for Washington.; 
 The Orange also could take some work, because its selection committee uses
three criteria -- national ranking, television audience and fan support -- to
choose an at-large opponent for the Big Eight champion. The Bears were on last
week's Orange Bowl list of 16 and made this week's cut to 12.;   But Cal would
have to be ranked very high -- probably meaning the top three or four -- to
offset questions about its fan base and television appeal, an Orange Bowl
representative said. A group of 7,500 Cal fans traveled to Tucson, Ariz., for
last year's Copper Bowl, a Cal spokesman said.;   If Cal can avoid losing
before Nov. 17, the day bowl bids are delivered, the Bears could net games as
lucrative as the Sugar Bowl, which offers $3.365 million to each team, or the
Fiesta Bowl, which has a $2 million payout. The bid date means the Bears' bowl
hopes should be decided before the Stanford game.;   "We would consider a team
that finished tied for the league championship or lost competitively to the
top team and finished 10-1, depending on how the other bowl possibilities
would be," Fiesta representative Wayne Goodrich said. "We have roots in the
Pac-10. A school like Cal would have a presence on the day of our game.";  
Said Troy Mathieu, assistant executive director of the Sugar Bowl: "At this
point it's very early, but we are interested in the Pac-10 runner-up. . . .
Our game follows the Rose Bowl on ABC, (so) having a Pac-10 team in a bowl
game keeps the fans tuned in. But it's still early.";   The Citrus Bowl has a
soft spot for "Cinderella" teams such as Cal, Citrus president Bob Moore said,
but there's concern about how many Bears fans would go to Orlando, Fla., to
attend the game. The crowd enthusiasm against Washington helped allay that
worry, particularly with a Citrus Bowl representative in attendance, but the
Citrus committee also will look at how many fans go to Cal's Pac-10 games on
the road.;   It's too early for the Hall of Fame Bowl to put together a list,
said Jim McVay, the bowl's executive director, but Cal certainly has his
attention.;   "There are a lot of pluses," McVay said. "Great players, good
reputation, hell of a team. There aren't any negatives."; CAL'S NEW YEAR'S DAY

HURRICANES PUT DENT IN HOPES OF ORANGE BOWL FOR SHOWDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
BOWLS: MIAMI GOES TO SUGAR BOWL AGAINST SEC CHAMPION. IT ALSO ADDS A FLAW TO 
THE NOTRE DAME-COLORADO MATCHUP.

<P>
Even before Miami knocked off top-ranked Notre Dame, 27-10, Saturday night, the 
Hurricanes and Fighting Irish accepted bids to New Year's Day bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
However, seventh-ranked Miami's victory over the Irish spoiled the Orange 
Bowl's hoped-for showdown for the national championship between Notre Dame 
(11-1) and second-ranked Colorado (11-0), which earned an automatic berth by 
winning the Big Eight Conference championship outright for the first time since 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said the Irish accepted the Orange 
Bowl bid because they haven't played in the New Year's Night game since 1975. 
Rosenthal said the Fighting Irish also considered bids from the Sugar, Cotton, 
Fiesta and Citrus Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Because the game is at night, the Orange Bowl could still get its showdown if 
things break just right earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado last played in the Orange Bowl in 1977, when it was Big Eight 
co-champion. Nebraska or Oklahoma has been the conference representative at 
Miami every year since. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (10-1) accepted a bid to play the Southeastern Conference champion -- 
either No. 4 Alabama (10-0), No. 10 Auburn (8-2) or No. 8 Tennessee (9-1) -- in 
the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC runner-up, or possibly an SEC co-champion that does not go to the Sugar 
Bowl, will play in the Cotton Bowl against ninth-ranked Arkansas (9-2), the 
Southwest Conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked Michigan (10-1) joined No. 12 USC (8-2-1), the Pacific 10 
Conference champion, in a rematch at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena by beating Ohio 
State, 28-18, to clinch the Big Ten Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State (8-3) will play the odd team out in the SEC on Jan. 1 in the Hall of 
Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Florida State (8-2), the only team to beat Miami, will play No. 6 
Nebraska (10-1), which lost only to Colorado, in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 1 at 
Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Clemson (9-2) will play No. 17 West Virginia (9-2) Dec. 30th in the 
Gator Bowl at Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Big Ten runner-up and 11th-ranked Illinois (9-2) and Atlantic Coast Conference 
co-champion Virginia (10-2), No. 16, accepted bids to play in the Florida 
Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day. Illinois lost only to Michigan and Colorado. 
Virginia lost only to Notre Dame and Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Bowl was hoping to invite Indiana and its All-American running back 
Anthony Thompson, but the Hooisers were upset, 15-14, Saturday by Purdue. So 
the game at Anaheim Stadium will have Florida (7-3) and Emmitt Smith against 
Washington (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Penn State (7-3-1) accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl Dec. 29 
against BYU after beating No. 19 Pitt, 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
'It won't be 16-13 (in the Holiday Bowl)," Paterno said. "Maybe (BYU Coach) 
LaVell Edwards will take it easy because I'm his buddy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe we'll throw and he'll run," added Paterno, drawing laughter because 
the suggestion went contrary to the teams' offensive philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
No. 21 BYU (10-2) clinched the Western Athletic Conference championship and the 
automatic berth in the Holiday Bowl that goes with it by beating San Diego 
State, 48-27, Saturday night at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego -- site of the 
Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its defeat, Pitt (6-3-1) will play No. 14 Texas A&amp;M (7-3) in the 
John Hancock Bowl Dec. 16 at El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (6-4) will play Syracuse (6-4) in the Peach Bowl at Atlanta Stadium on 
Dec. 30. Georgia and Syracuse each has one game remaining -- Georgia at 
archrival Georgia Tech and Syracuse against Louisville in Tokyo. Both games are 
next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Michigan State (7-4), with losses to Miami, Notre Dame, Michigan and 
Illinois, won its fifth consecutive game Saturday, 31-3, over Wisconsin, to 
earn a spot in the Aloha Bowl on Christmas Day against No. 24 Hawaii (8-2) in 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (7-4) beat Mississippi State, 21-11, Saturday and accepted a bid to 
the Liberty Bowl on Dec. 28 at Memphis, Tenn., against Air Force (8-3). The 
Falcons were eliminated from the WAC race and Holiday Bowl consideration by 
BYU's victory. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (6-4-1), by beating archrival Arizona State, 28-10, on Saturday, will 
stay at home in Tucson to play North Carolina State (7-4) in the inaugural 
Copper Bowl on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
In the Independence Bowl, Tulsa (6-5) will play Oregon (7-4) at Shreveport, 
La., on Dec. 16 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Texas Tech (8-3), despite a 40-24 loss to 13-ranked Houston on Saturday, 
will face No. 23 Duke (8-3) in the All-American Bowl on Dec. 28 at Birmingham, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Houston (8-2) is on NCAA probation for recruiting violations and is ineligible 
for post-season play. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (9-2), champion of the Big West Conference, will play Ball State 
(7-2-2), the Mid-American Conference titlist, in the California Raisin Bowl on 
Dec. 9 at Fresno.

<HEADLINE>  BOWLS ANNOUNCE THEIR CHOICES
BUT, AS USUAL, EVERYONE KNEW WELL IN ADVANCE WHO
WOULD GO WHERE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Ric Bucher contributed to this report.; Chart
attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "To me, that was a farce," he said Sunday after the Hurricanes accepted a
bid from the Orange Bowl.;   "The bowl matchups were made I don't know how
long ago.";   Of course, nothing was supposed to be decided until noon PST
Sunday. Bowls are subject to a $250,000 fine for breaking the deadline, but no
fines have been announced.;   The bowl selections have left some schools
disappointed and frustrated.;   No. 17 Notre Dame, despite a two-game losing
streak, will play No. 5 Florida in the Sugar Bowl.;   After Saturday's 35-13
victory over Notre Dame, several Penn State players were bitter that the bowl
deadline was broken to their detriment.;   "We thought that we should have
gone to the Sugar Bowl," wide receiver O.J. McDuffie said. "But if it's the
Fiesta, we're happy. We wanted a New Year's Day bowl game and got one. We're
satisfied.";   Cal also felt squeezed out of the Sugar Bowl picture.;   "I
think the only thing that is being hurt by that is the Sugar Bowl," said Cal
senior tight end Brent Woodall.;   "They are taking a team with a lesser
record. If they wanted to have the best game possible, they would have taken
the team with the highest ranking, and that's us.";   Cotton Bowl president
John Stuart said, "There's no perfect system -- you've got to start with that.
It's going to take a while to work all the kinks out.;   "From the fans'
standpoint, I hope it's going to get better.";   Next year things will change
as the bowl alliance begins. The Orange, Cotton, Sugar, Fiesta and Citrus have
aligned with five conferences and Notre Dame to divide the spots. The Rose
Bowl, which has not produced an undisputed national champion since Southern
Cal in 1972, is tied to the Big Ten and the Pacific 10.;   Which of the
consortium's five bowls hosts the best game is determined by the rankings of
the champions of the Southwest, Southeastern and Big Eight Conferences. The
bowl connected with the highest-ranked champion -- the Sugar has the
Southeastern, the Cotton has the Southwest, and the Orange has the Big Eight
-- picks first from among the at-large teams. If the highest-ranked matchup is
among the at-large teams, then the Fiesta would host the premier game.;   But
even this solution won't solve all the problems.;   There would be nothing to
prevent the Sugar Bowl from selecting based on television ratings instead of
national rankings again, as it did this year by working out a deal with Notre
Dame instead of a higher-ranked team.;   "That's one of those items we'll just
have to feel out," Stuart said. "I think it happened this season for one
reason and one reason only -- they had to turn on TV sets. . . . I just see
the chances of stability as much greater."; BOWL GAMES AT A GLANCE; Bowl/

THE BOWL GAMES;

<P>
ROSE BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
SCHEMBECHLER COULD USE LAST LAUGH AGAINST USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler is reminded of his 1-7 record in the 
Rose Bowl, which is often, he jokes about it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a logical response, because he can't do anything now about what has 
happened in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his lighthearted comments, Schembechler would like to start 
chipping away at his record by beating USC today in the 75th renewal of the 
Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith doesn't have such skeletons rattling in his coaching 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there is a certain urgency for Smith to win today's game, 
considering that his Trojans lost to Michigan State in last year's Rose Bowl 
game in his first appearance as a head coach. It would also take some of the 
sting out of a regular-season ending loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
That defeat ranks as one of the most disappointing in 100 years of USC 
football. If USC (10-1) had won, it would be defending a No. 1 ranking in 
college football against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback Rodney Peete has said that it will be a long time before that 
defeat is little more than a memory. 
</P>
<P>
So how will the Trojans respond? Smith isn't sure. "We won't know until we come 
out on the field. We haven't been able to judge ourselves in that situation 
because it's the first time we've come off a loss this season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Michigan (8-2-1), the Wolverines could be a national championship 
contender today if it weren't for early season losses to Notre Dame and Miami 
by a total of 3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written that the USC-Michigan matchup is a secondary bowl game, 
inasmuch as No. 1-ranked Notre Dame and No. 3 West Virginia will be playing for 
the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Schembechler and Smith contend that the "Granddaddy of them 
all," the Rose Bowl, doesn't take a back seat in viewing interest to any bowl. 
Subsequent television ratings will provide more insight. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, today's Rose Bowl game has its intrinsic interest -- 
Schembechler's albatross-like record along with the Big Ten's failure here in 
recent years, losing 12 of the past 14 Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there's the relationship between the coaches. Smith got his coaching 
start as a member of Schembechler's staff at Miami of Ohio and Michigan in the 
late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
They've been friends ever since, and Smith attributes much of his coaching 
philosophy to his early apprenticeship under Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has lost only 5 games and won 18 in 2 seasons at USC. In those losses, 
Trojan turnovers were decisive. Smith says they will be a key factor today. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan isn't likely to oblige, considering that quarterbacks Michael Taylor 
and Demetrius Brown have thrown only 2 interceptions and have lost only 8 
fumbles the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
With the notable exception of the Notre Dame game when USC had 4 turnovers, the 
Trojans haven't been error-prone. 
</P>
<P>
Peete has thrown 10 interceptions, but that's misleading, considering his 
entire offensive output. He has completed 208 of 338 passes (61.5%) for an 
average of 241.3 yards a game and 18 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Michigan's quarterbacks have attempted only 191 passes. The 
Wolverines are primarily a running team, featuring tailback Tony Boles and 
fullback Leroy Hoard, who are each averaging 5.5 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
"Michigan will not be taken out of its running game," Smith said. "They're 
better at it than any team we've played." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Wolverines may be forced to pass more often than in previous games 
considering the Trojans are No. 2-ranked nationally in rushing defense, 
allowing an average of only 76.6 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
USC has a more balanced offense, averaging 214.6 yards running and 247 yards 
passing compared with 256.6 and 153.4 for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have what Smith calls bend-but-not-break defenses. Michigan features 
one of the nation's best defensive linemen in tackle Mark Messner. 
</P>
<P>
However, Peete, who placed second to Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders in the 
Heisman Trophy voting, seemingly provides USC with an edge in an otherwise even 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Brown became the starting quarterback when Taylor suffered a broken collarbone 
in the ninth game of the season against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Brown had 16 interceptions last season, a factor in losing his starting job to 
Taylor. However, he hasn't been intercepted since replacing Taylor, completing 
61.7% of his passes for 5 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
It's Brown's show today as Taylor was recently hospitalized with the flu and 
isn't expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines are aware of Peete's capabilities. Said Messner: "He's very, 
very fast and he can beat you single-handedly." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had some success blitzing Peete in a 27-10 victory, and it wouldn't 
be surprising if Michigan uses the same tactic. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines don't seem to be up-tight, perhaps reflecting the mood of their 
coach, who has been accommodating and apparently relaxed since the team's 
arrival here. 
</P>
<P>
As for his 1-7 Rose Bowl record, Schembechler, who has won more games than any 
other active college coach, dismisses it by saying: 
</P>
<P>
"If you win all the time, maybe you don't have as much appreciation for it. The 
thing that has balanced out my career is the fact I haven't been as successful 
in bowls. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had the same record I had in bowls as I do in the regular season, I'd 
probably be too cocky and have too big an ego." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kickoff for today's game is 2 p.m. A crowd of 95,000 to 100,000 is expected. . 
. . USC is a 6 1/2-point favorite. Even though Aaron Emanuel has been USC's 
most productive tailback in recent games, Coach Larry Smith said that Ricky 
Ervins would start today. "He has had excellent practices," Smith said of 
Ervins, "but all of our tailbacks will play." He was mainly referring to 
Ervins, Emanuel and Scott Lockwood. Smith would also like to use Steven Webster 
if possible. Webster, a senior, has missed virtually the entire season with 
injuries. . . . Michigan's Wilbur Odom, a sophomore, who has played in only one 
game, will back up Demetrius Brown at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
USC is ranked fifth in the polls, Michigan 11th. . . . Smith concedes that 
Michigan has an edge over USC in the kicking game. Mike Gillette, a catcher on 
the baseball team, is averaging 40.4 yards on punts. He set a school record 
with his 56-yard field goal against Ohio State. USC punter Chris Sperle is 
averaging 38.3 yards, and Quin Rodriguez made 14 of 19 field goals, 7 for 7 
inside the 30-yard line. . . . Erik Affholter, USC's All-American split end, 
set schools records in the regular season for receptions in a season (63) and 
career (118). Michigan has accomplished wide receivers in Greg McMurtry, Chris 
Calloway and John Kolesar. However, that group has had a total of only 67 
receptions on a run-oriented team. 
</P>
<P>
T.J. Osman, Michigan's middle guard, on Bo Schembechler's overall 4-11 bowl 
record: "He told us before we left that if we got a question about his bowl 
record to answer by saying that it's his record and not anything that we had to 
do with." . . . Asked to comment on Michigan allowing 31 points against Ohio 
State in the second half of a final regular-season game, defensive tackle Mark 
Messner said: "We're still asking what happened. We had the same players and we 
were calling the same defenses, but they were going right through us." Michigan 
won, though, 34-31, on a late, 41-yard pass from Brown to Kolesar. Michigan is 
ranked ninth nationally in scoring defense, allowing an average of 13.9 points 
a game. . . . USC has a 3-1 record against Michigan in the Rose Bowl and 3-3 
overall. The Trojans have an 18-7 Rose Bowl record. . . . Schembechler has lost 
only one Rose Bowl game by more than 8 points, a 24-14 loss to UCLA in 1983.

With eligibility left, the kids are going over the wall to join the pros. What 
has happened to the student-athlete? You ask one: 
</P>
<P>
"Are you interested in engineering?" 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed I am. I am dying to study the power plant of a Ferrari -- my Ferrari." 
</P>
<P>
It is regrettable that undergraduates in football don't have the healthy 
outlook of their university elders, who see the game as simple beauty, free 
from commercial pressure and general money-grubbing. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, colleges today play no more than 12 games. They are playing bowl 
games before the season even starts -- things called the Kickoff Classic and 
Disneyland Pigskin Classic. 
</P>
<P>
A college distinguished for its football has set up a private television deal 
with NBC. Lesser arrangements by universities result in as many as 11 games 
being seen on TV on a single Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Why can't the players comport themselves like those who run college football, 
detached from earthly goods, dedicated to the spirit of friendly rivalry that 
sportsmen seek? 
</P>
<P>
New Year's Day, you will see that the number of bowl games on television has 
been limited to eight. 
</P>
<P>
"You will note the restraint," university people will tell players thinking of 
jumping to the pros. "We easily could play 10 on New Year's, scheduling two 
games between midnight and 6 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, college football favored us with four bowls on Jan. 1 -- Rose, 
Orange, Cotton and Sugar. 
</P>
<P>
It expanded to five with something known as the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl. Then, 
presumably on a leveraged buyout, the Florida Citrus Bowl took over the 
Tangerine Bowl and soon bumped New Year's Day viewing to six games. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame Bowl increased it to seven, the figure now escalating to eight 
with a switching of dates of the Mazda Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Eight bowl games battling each other on the same day might appear as overkill, 
but what's a little cannibalization among educated people? 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Cotton Bowl has come to be called the Mobil Cotton Bowl and the 
Sugar Bowl the USF&amp;G Sugar Bowl. The Sun Bowl became the John Hancock Sun 
Bowl, until such time as the sponsor decided such billing was a deterrent to 
direct communication. 
</P>
<P>
The name was changed to John Hancock Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And the universities, observing events, go along, because they are not as 
commercially oriented as today's players. 
</P>
<P>
Over in Tucson, they got a postseason game certified known as the Copper Bowl. 
Linking up with a firm that makes mouth freshener, the game became known as the 
Copper BreathLess Bowl, but that would change to Copper Bowl, presented by 
BreathLess. 
</P>
<P>
Last heard from, the game was still breathing, but without its mouth-freshening 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, this is watched unblinkingly by the colleges, role models for those 
student-athletes who would dump their schools for a lousy $80,000 a year from 
the pros. 
</P>
<P>
Since only one bowl game, the Rose, has fixed participants every year, the 
others must hoof it, entering into bloodlettings to beat out rivals for the 
best teams. 
</P>
<P>
Rules prevent bowls from contacting teams before specified dates, and, of 
course, no school would fudge, accepting bids prematurely, because this would 
set a bum example for the players. 
</P>
<P>
Watching a school that lacks integrity, a player with eligibility might be 
tempted to talk to a pro team in the alley about the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Now, say, you play for Clemson where home sellouts are automatic. Why open with 
Miami when you can play Cal State Long Beach? 
</P>
<P>
Same financial result. 
</P>
<P>
So you wipe out Long Beach, 59-0, enhance the winning record and prepare three 
weeks down the line to entertain Appalachian State. Picturing George Allen, 
Long Beach coach, on the sideline last Saturday, you heard him mumble: "The 
future is 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
But Clemson establishes standards any admiring kid will want to emulate as he 
strolls the boulevard of life.

<P>
UCLA: UPSET OF NO. 2 WASHINGTON PROVIDES A MUCH-NEEDED LIFT HEADING INTO 
RENEWAL OF USC RIVALRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's 25-22 upset of second-ranked Washington Saturday in Seattle was 
significant in many respects. 
</P>
<P>
It provided a struggling team with an emotional lift and might have a 
long-range effect on the football program. 
</P>
<P>
It was also one of the most astounding victories in UCLA history considering 
Washington's 21-point favoritism and the Huskies' previous domination of 
Pacific 10 Conference opponents this season. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by winning, the Bruins (5-5) have an opportunity to avert a second 
consecutive losing season if they beat USC Saturday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
There is some irony, however, to UCLA's status. Even if the Bruins beat the 
Trojans and finish with a 6-5 record, they probably won't be invited to a bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Athletic Director Peter Dalis said that his phone wasn't ringing 
repeatedly Sunday with calls from bowl representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard a thing since we lost to Michigan (Sept. 22)," Dalis said. 
"The Peach Bowl was the last bowl to pay any attention to us. All the oral 
commitments have been made. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way that you might slip into a bowl is if a bowl had an agreement 
with someone earlier and that team might not have a six-victory season and the 
bowl doesn't have a backup." 
</P>
<P>
A NCAA rule prohibits schools with losing records from playing in a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana is committed to the Peach Bowl Dec. 29 in Atlanta, reportedly against 
North Carolina State or Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana has a 5-3-1 record with games remaining against Illinois and Purdue. 
Last year, Indiana was apparently set to play in the Freedom Bowl, before 
losing to Illinois and Purdue and finishing with a 5-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that conferences are as eager as some bowl representatives to 
place their teams in bowl games at the earliest possible date. 
</P>
<P>
For example, five Pac-10 teams are already in bowl games: Washington, Rose; 
USC, John Hancock; Oregon, Freedom; Arizona, Aloha, and California, Copper. 
</P>
<P>
Official invitations will not be presented until Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue wasn't thinking about a bowl game after the Bruins' 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts us in a position to save our year, bowl, or no bowl, " Donahue said. 
"We have an opportunity for a winning season in our big game with our 
cross-town rival. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's more to it than that. When you beat the No. 2 team in the country 
in their stadium, with the weather conditions (wind and light rain) it helps 
your program, your confidence and the players who have been struggling." 
</P>
<P>
To put UCLA's accomplishment in perspective, it ranks with a 7-6 victory over 
Stanford's Rose Bowl-bound "Vow Boys" in 1935; the 14-12 victory over Michigan 
State in the 1966 Rose Bowl; a 20-17 victory in 1972 over Nebraska, the 
defending national champion, and a 23-10 victory over Ohio State in the 1976 
Rose Bowl game after the Bruins lost to the Buckeyes, 41-20, during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game with USC will be unusual in that a Rose Bowl invitation will 
not be on the line for either team. That was the situation in 1986 and 1980 
(when both teams were on probation). Previously, the Rose Bowl bid was a prize 
for at least one team, or one team had already clinched a Rose Bowl berth, in 
every year since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's defense, which has been maligned at times this season, held Washington 
to 283 total yards, 139 yards below its season average. UCLA defensive 
coordinator Bob Field said the team had four goals: 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want (tailback) Greg Lewis to rush for 100 yards (he got 50). No. 2 
was not to allow them to break any run for more than 20 yards (they didn't). 
No. 3 was not to let them catch any pass for over 25 yards (which they did) and 
make (quarterback) Mark Brunell beat us with his arm, and not his feet. (He 
completed only 10 of 34 passes). We wanted to make him one dimensional, not 
two. We just played our base defense, simple and sound."

   Top-ranked Notre Dame defeated No. 3 West Virginia 34-21 in the
Fiesta Bowl to give the Fighting Irish their eighth national
championship in college football and the first since 1977.
   Notre Dame's Tony Rice, a junior, threw for two touchdowns and a
career-high 213 yards as the Irish finished the season undefeated at
12-0.
   In other bowl games Monday, No. 11 Michigan upset No. 5 Southern
California 22-14 in the Rose Bowl; No. 9 UCLA beat No. 8 Arkansas
17-3 in the Cotton Bowl; and No. 13 Clemson edged No. 10 Oklahoma
13-6 in the Citrus Bowl.
   Seventeenth-ranked Syracuse defeated No. 16 Louisiana State 23-10
in the Hall of Fame Bowl; No. 2 Miami defeated No. 6 Nebraska 23-3
in the Orange Bowl; and No. 4 Florida State defeated No. 7 Auburn
13-7 in the Sugar Bowl.
   Notre Dame's victory assured it of the top spot in the final
Associated Press poll.
   Rice completed seven of 11 passes, including a 29-yard scoring
strike to Raghib Ismail late in the second quarter and a 3-yard pass
to Frank Jacobs early in the fourth quarter.
   West Virginia, which finished 11-1, had to be satisified with the
first 11-victory season in its 96-year football history.

<HEADLINE>  BOWLING THEM OVER ON NEW YEAR'S DAY
COLLEGE GAME IS FEELING THE EFFECTS OF A
FULL SCHEDULE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  College Football
See also related articles on this page.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It should be pointed out that Neinas considers himself "an above-average
football fan," which qualifies as a huge understatement. Neinas, the executive
director of the College Football Association, wants to keep up with all the
action.;    But it's not possible. His eyes don't move quickly enough, and
even the fastest remote control in the West would be woefully lacking.;   
"Eight games," Neinas says. "It's too much. It's not fair to the fans.";   
Especially for those fans with only one television set.;    Just when you
thought they couldn't stuff any more games into that overstuffed bag that is
New Year's Day, the bowls went ahead and did it. Starting at 8:30 a.m. with
the Gator Bowl and ending around 9 p.m. with the Sugar Bowl, there will be
eight games today, a football hater's worst nightmare.;    Eight is enough; 
And it's hardly a dream for the bowls, either. For them, eight is more than
enough. In fact, eight is ridiculous. Furthermore, eight is one of the reasons
some of critics suggest the bowl system could be in trouble in the 1990s.;   
The glut of games on Jan. 1 has the bowls extremely nervous. So do falling TV
ratings and the ever-expanding NFL season, which could squeeze several bowls
out of business. Then there's the threat that proceeds from corporate sponsors
might be subject to taxation, along with flaws in the selection process, which
has many in the college establishment fuming and screaming for a playoff.;   
Indeed, this is not the best of times for the folks who run the bowl kingdom.;
   "We're not dead yet," said the Orange Bowl's Steve Hatchell, the head of
the College Bowl Association.;    But there are signs that the castle walls
are cracking. Nowhere is it more evident than the erosion of television
ratings, a lifeblood for the bowls, on New Year's Day.;    In a former life .
. .;    For years, Jan. 1 was the domain of the Rose, Sugar, Cotton and Orange
bowls, and they enjoyed the spoils. In 1981, the four bowls averaged an
impressive 19.9 ranking. The 1979 Rose Bowl had a 29.2 rating.;    However, in
1982, the Fiesta Bowl moved to Jan. 1. Last year, there were seven games on
that day.;    The glut's fallout could be inevitable. With ratings down,
rights fees from the networks might be reduced. And with exposure diminished,
corporate sponsors, which pay a significant portion of the bowls' ticket,
might think twice about writing the next check.;    "There's little question
the television marketplace is flattening out in the 1990s," said Big Ten
Commissioner Jim Delany, whose conference has a lucrative tie-in to the Rose
Bowl. "Sure, there's a concern.";    "How far can the television dollar go?"
Hatchell said. "Overexposure in an undistinguished market could be
detrimental.";    The obvious solution would be for the bowls to work together
to find remedies to their problems. But the bowls appear to be their own worst
enemies.;    The urgency to work together, though, might be greater than it's
ever been. Besides the ratings difficulties, the expansion of the NFL regular
season -- which goes to the last weekend in December -- significantly reduces
time slots available to the bowls, at least as far as television is
concerned.;    There's also the threat from the Internal Revenue Service.
Currently, the majority of the bowls take in large sums of money from
corporate sponsors. Because bowls are considered non-profit organizations,
those funds haven't been taxed. But the IRS is doing audits to see whether it
should change its policy.;    Hatchell and former Fiesta Bowl head Bruce
Skinner maintain the situation isn't as bleak as it seems. Revenues have gone
up, and payouts continue to grow every year.;    They maintain the system is
healthy, even if others disagree.;    "It's not in as bad a state as some
people have portrayed it," said the Orange Bowl's Hatchell. "There are a lot
of games with incredible interest. There's a lot of good football being
played.;    "Sure, we need some fine-tuning. That doesn't hurt in any
industry.";    But if the problems continue to mount, the bowls could go from
some fine-tuning to a complete overhaul. Even then, the day might come when
the schedule again calls for only four games on Jan. 1.;    Otherwise known as
the national quarterfinals.;   BOWL GAMES AT A GLANCE; Bowl/

SCHEMBECHLER TO QUIT AS COACH AFTER ROSE BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE WINNINGEST ACTIVE BIG-TIME COACH IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE 
HIS DECISION TO HIS WOLVERINE PLAYERS TODAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Schembechler, big-time college football's winningest active coach, will step 
down for medical reasons after Michigan plays USC in the Rose Bowl, sources 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, 60, will turn the Wolverines' program over to assistant Gary 
Moeller. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler will remain as Michigan's athletic director, a post that was added 
to his title in 1988 after Don Canham reached the mandatory retirement age of 
70, said the sources, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler was out of his office early today. He was to meet with his players 
in the afternoon. A news conference was scheduled for 5 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler told a university sociology class Monday that he would never sit 
in the coach's office of the $12.5-million Center of Champions. The building, 
to be completed next autumn, will house the football program. 
</P>
<P>
He also told the students that Moeller would be the next coach. 
</P>
<P>
Heart attacks in 1970 and 1987 resulted in open-heart surgery, and 
Schembechler's physicians have urged him to slow down ever since. The decision 
was made easier because the Michigan football program is riding the crest of 
two consecutive Big Ten championships. 
</P>
<P>
It also was becoming necessary because Associate Athletic Director Jack 
Weidenbach, who has been in charge of daily operations of the department while 
Schembechler tended to football duties, is nearing retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Schembechler said he decided to make the announcement now 
because he wants prospective recruits to know who the coach will be. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler leads all coaches in NCAA Division I-A with a record of 234-64-8 
after 21 years at Michigan and six at Miami of Ohio. He is fifth on the 
all-time list and needs only four more victories to match his mentor at Ohio 
State, Woody Hayes. Schembechler is the winningest coach in Michigan history at 
194-47-5. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler never has had a losing season. Fifteen of his 21 Michigan teams 
have been ranked in the top 10 nationally. The 1985 team finished No. 2 after 
beating Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The only honor that has eluded Schembechler is the mythical national 
championship. The Wolverines began the 1989 season ranked No. 1 but lost their 
opening game to Notre Dame before reeling off 10 straight wins. They are ranked 
No. 3 and have only a slim chance of slipping past Colorado and Miami in the 
final Associated Press poll after the bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think that my career has been a failure because I have never won a 
national title, you have another think coming," Schembechler said a few days 
before beating Ohio State in the final regular-season game this season. "I have 
never played a game for the national title. Our goals always have been to win 
the Big Ten title and the Rose Bowl. If we do that, then we consider it a 
successful season." 
</P>
<P>
The New Year's Day game against USC will be Schembechler's 10th Rose Bowl and 
third in the last four years. The Wolverines (10-1) earned their second 
consecutive Big Ten title this season and 13th in Schembechler's career. 
</P>
<P>
Moeller, 48, has been an assistant to Schembechler for 18 years. He rejoined 
the Wolverines' staff in 1980 after three years as coach at Illinois, where he 
was released after compiling a 6-24-3 record.

THINGS DON'T ALWAYS COME UP ROSES; 
</P>
<P>
ROSE BOWL: A TARDY PARTICIPATING TEAM, TWO PHANTOM TOUCHDOWNS AND WOODY HAYES' 
TANTRUMS HAVE ALL BEEN A PART OF THE NEW YEAR'S DAY GAME. 
</P>

<P>
A near fist-fight between rival coaches, phantom touchdowns, a coach's 
tantrums. Is this any way to start the New Year? 
</P>
<P>
Things don't always come up roses in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
There are some thorns among the dramatic moments, upsets and spectacular plays 
that are part of the lore of the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
For reference, see Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler, who will be making his 10th 
appearance in Pasadena Jan. 1 against USC, with a record of two victories, 
seven losses and one disputed touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After the first Rose Bowl game in 1902 between Michigan and Stanford at 
Tournament Park, a polo match and then chariot races replaced the game through 
1915. 
</P>
<P>
There is no documentation of chariot disputes, but in the first Rose Bowl game 
played at its present site the grumbling began before the teams even came onto 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1923: GET ME TO THE GAME ON TIME 
</P>
<P>
This would be USC's first of 27 appearances in the Rose Bowl and the Trojans 
were the second choice to represent the West. 
</P>
<P>
California, which had won the Pacific Coast Conference championship and had 
defeated USC, declined the invitation for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern representative, Penn State, had been invited in April of the 
previous year, but still the Nittany Lions couldn't get to the game on time. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Elmer (Gloomy Gus) Henderson and his players stewed on the field 
awaiting Penn State's arrival. The game was scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m., 
but Penn State didn't arrive until 45 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's coach, Hugo Bezdek, was not a stranger to Pasadena, so he couldn't 
have claimed that he was lost. He had the unusual background of having coached 
Oregon and the Mare Island Marines to victories in the 1917 and 1918 Rose Bowl 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson confronted Bedzek, who was standing alone on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Where have you been?" Henderson demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"We got caught in a traffic jam," Bezdek replied. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson: "You tried to stall so we would get itchy." 
</P>
<P>
Bezdek: "You're a liar." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson: "You're a lot of bunk." 
</P>
<P>
Bezdek: "Take off your glasses and we'll settle the whole matter right here." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson declined, saying later that he wanted no part of Bezdek, who had 
earned his way through the University of Chicago by fighting under an assumed 
name. 
</P>
<P>
If Bezdek had planned to gain a psychological advantage by being late, it 
didn't work as the Trojans won, 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
Bezdek was hardly charitable in defeat, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"The best team lost. The best team and the best coaching in the world wouldn't 
have won against the luck USC had today. When at its best, my team could beat 
USC by 40 points. My only regret is that Elmer Henderson had left his glasses 
on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1949: RAISING CAIN WITH CAL 
</P>
<P>
Instant replay: Where was it when it was needed the most? 
</P>
<P>
In the category of controversial touchdowns, the 1949 Rose Bowl game between 
Northwestern and California still has an eminent place. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third game of the series between the Pacific Coast Conference and 
the Big Ten (then called the Big Nine). 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Northwestern fullback Art Murakowski fumbled while 
lunging for a touchdown from the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
A picture in The Times showed that Murakowski's feet were not in the end zone, 
but referee Jimmy Cain nevertheless signaled a touchdown, ruling that 
Murakowski fumbled after his body had crossed the plane of the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
That decision was challenged then, as it still is today, by photographic 
evidence, although camera angles can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
Murakowski's touchdown and subsequent missed extra point provided Northwestern 
with a 13-7 lead. The Wildcats went on to win, 20-14, getting the winning 
touchdown on Ed Tunnicliff's 43-yard run late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cain made the touchdown signal, the actual decision was the 
responsibility of field judge Jay Berwanger. 
</P>
<P>
Berwanger, as you may recall, was the first Heisman Trophy winner in 1935, from 
the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern hasn't played in a Rose Bowl game since 1949, and with its 
football program on the downgrade, it may never again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE WACKY WORLD OF WOODY 
</P>
<P>
Woody Hayes, Ohio State's late coach, made an indelible impression in his many 
trips to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The cantankerous Hayes set a standard for boorish behavior in his first 
appearance in the Rose Bowl in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
He complained about the bands chewing up an already muddy field and he was less 
than gracious after the Buckeyes beat the Trojans, 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from Woody's bombast: 
</P>
<P>
"The bands should have been required to stay on the sidelines instead of 
putting on the show where we were going to play. I think bands are a fine thing 
but they owe their popularity to football, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about four, possibly five teams in the Big Ten that could beat USC. 
Big Ten teams are better in the Rose Bowl because they are raised on tougher 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes was hardly a seer, though, considering that the Pac-10 has beaten the Big 
Ten in 18 of the last 24 Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio State coach's ugliest display of temper occurred in the 1973 Rose Bowl 
game against USC. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, he shoved a camera held by The Times' Art Rogers into the 
photographer's face. Rogers required medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, which the national champion Trojans won, 42-17, Hayes was asked 
about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
He exploded, cursing a reporter and storming out of the interview tent. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal battery suit on behalf of Rogers was later dropped when Hayes sent a 
letter of apology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1979: WHO NEEDS THE BALL TO SCORE? 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years after Murakowski scored his disputed touchdown in the Rose Bowl, 
USC's Charles White revived the play against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Only this time television instant replay was available to show that officials 
botched the call. 
</P>
<P>
Here was the situation: 
</P>
<P>
USC had the ball on the Michigan three-yard line in the second quarter when 
White, the tailback, sky-dived toward the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
He reached it all right, but without the ball, leaving it at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
One official signaled a touchdown, another ruled that Michigan had gained 
possession by recovering a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Paul Kamanski cast the tiebreaking vote, saying that the line judge, 
Gilbert Marchman, was in charge of forward progress of the ball. Since the line 
judge was emphatic that the ball had broken the plane of the goal line, 
Kamanski concluded that White had scored. 
</P>
<P>
Others who watched the instant replay, ardently disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, White's touchdown gave USC a 14-3 lead, and the Trojans went on 
to win, 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
The victory provided USC with a share of the national championship with Alabama 
and left Schembechler with an 0-5 record in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Bo had an opinion on the play, saying: "From what all our players say, he 
didn't score. I don't want to talk about it. If I do, I'll sure as hell say 
something that will get me into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some definite thoughts but I don't want to relate them here. It's a 
shame something like that had to distract from the effort of the kids, but the 
fact remains we didn't play well enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, USC scored the winning touchdown in a 17-13 victory over Notre Dame in 
a similar fashion, with tailback Michael Harper seemingly losing the ball while 
diving into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Said Schembechler at the time: "USC has perfected that play."

SMITH: USC IS VILLAIN AGAINST BO, MICHIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Some guys will do anything to win a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
That was USC Coach Larry Smith's good-natured response to the retirement 
announcement by Michigan's Bo Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, an assistant under Schembechler at both Michigan and Miami of Ohio and 
close to him ever since, already has lost one Rose Bowl game to his former 
mentor, a 22-14 setback last January. Now, Schembechler has a built-in 
emotional advantage in his Pasadena rematch with USC. 
</P>
<P>
You know, win one for the old coach in his last game. 
</P>
<P>
Smith didn't discount that aspect Thursday when he said: "I don't think there's 
any question that there will be a lot more media attention for Bo's last game. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about one of the great college football coaches in the country. 
There's no doubt in my mind that Michigan will be a little extra emotionally 
charged for the game and it provides an incentive and a challenge for us." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Schembechler's announcement came as somewhat of a surprise, but he 
liked the way his friend bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
"He made his own decision," Smith said. "Bo did it his way." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler has not won a national championship in his 27 years as a head 
coach, and even though his team is ranked No. 3 nationally, it doesn't figure 
that Michigan could climb to No. 1 even by beating USC. 
</P>
<P>
That assessment was made before Schembechler said the Rose Bowl would be his 
final game as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that if Michigan beats USC and No. 1-ranked Colorado loses to Notre 
Dame, there is a possibility that coaches and writers would vote Michigan No. 1 
as a sentimental gesture to Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler is 2-7 in the Rose Bowl, and Smith is 0-2, having lost in 
successive years to Michigan State and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the pressure builds with each defeat, Smith said: "I don't think it's 
the pressure. You keep searching until you find a way. I just try to find a 
better way of doing things, or correcting your mistakes that caused you to 
lose, or whatever it may be. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's inevitable. It's like the film of Rocky. You get knocked down enough 
times, you just find a way to win the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, of course, will be primed to deprive Schembechler, who has 234 
victories, of his last win. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a bittersweet type of thing," Smith said. "This is one time we're 
going to be wearing the black hat no matter what. And he's going to be wearing 
the white hat. We're the villains in this one." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to recall a Schembechler story, Smith didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first day I was hired as an assistant coach at Michigan along with 
some other guys. We drove to Ann Arbor, Mich., in the middle of December and 
checked into a hotel. It was snowing, and we were told to be in the office at 7 
o'clock in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo never told us how to get there. He just said to be there. So, with the 
weather, we were slipping and sliding with our cars all over the place trying 
to get there. 
</P>
<P>
"We got there five minutes early. And there was Bo, all stretched out and 
relaxed, and he asked, 'Where have you been?' He'd expected us to be there 20 
minutes early." 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC began practice Thursday on campus but will work out at UC Irvine Dec. 
27-30. . . . Outside linebacker Junior Seau, who suffered a mild right shoulder 
separation against UCLA, is ready to practice, but his contact work may be 
limited. . . . The Trojans are well-represented on The Sporting News 
All-America first team, with Seau and defensive back Mark Carrier. UCLA punter 
Kirk Maggio also is on the team. . . . Wide receiver John Jackson has been 
named an NCAA Today's Top 6 award winner for scholastic achievement. Jackson 
carries a 3.30 grade-point average while working on a graduate degree in 
business . . . Coach Larry Smith said offensive tackle Pat Harlow has a back 
problem and is questionable for the Rose Bowl game. If he can't play, he'll be 
replaced by 6-foot-7, 290-pound Michael Moody. Smith's analysis of the 
Wolverines: "They don't beat themselves." . . . USC strong safety Mark Carrier 
is a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's best defensive 
back. . . . Omen? Smith is only the second coach in history to get to the Rose 
Bowl in his first three seasons at a school. Stanford's Tiny Thornhill 
(1933-35) was the other. Like Smith, he lost his first two Rose Bowl games but 
won the third.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE BOWL GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
IT HAS BEEN QUITE A REIGN FOR DUKE; 
</P>
<P>
BIG TEN COMMISSIONER WILL RETIRE WHEN A REPLACEMENT IS CHOSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of Wayne Duke's most prized possessions is the clipping from Sports 
Illustrated that pictures him with John Wayne at the Rose parade. John Wayne 
sent him the clipping and signed it, "To Wayne Duke from Duke Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Duke, commissioner of the Big Ten, smiles when he tells about that 
now-fading momento. 
</P>
<P>
So you see, Duke does have some fond memories of the annual trip he has made to 
California for the Rose Bowl every year for the past 18 years. But ask him 
about the highlights and lowlights of his New Year's Day ritual and he gives 
that familiar Wayne Duke grimace. 
</P>
<P>
He had been in town less than 3 hours Wednesday and he had already been asked 
why the Big Ten can't win the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Since announcing his retirement last summer, a retirement that will become 
effective in the upcoming year when a successor is chosen, Duke has had plenty 
of opportunities to review his tenure as leader of the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
The conference boasts the largest football and basketball attendance in the 
country, and that comes from winning a lot of games. 
</P>
<P>
Duke was chairman of the NCAA basketball tournament committee that expanded the 
field to 64 teams and upped the TV rights so that the tournament now brings in 
about $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
Duke was on the committee that put together a $103 million TV package between 
the Big Ten and the Rose Bowl that will run through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl game is truly dear to his heart. Duke has always been able to 
refer to the game as "the granddaddy of them all" without cracking a smile at 
the corny sound. He believes it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a traditional matchup, and Duke believes that college football should be 
more traditional, should match schools and school spirits for the pride and the 
memories and the glory, not an abstract No. 1 and No. 2 for a mythical title. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have a 'national championship' game in Phoenix this year, or, from 
time to time, in Miami, but this game will be sold out year after year after 
year," Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl is his kind of college football. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Byers, the longtime executive director of the NCAA, now retired, who 
strongly influenced Duke during his early years in the NCAA office, told the 
Chicago Tribune: "We both came from the romantic era in sports. Emphasis was 
placed on values to be learned from the game. You competed because you enjoyed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
While he can get quite philosophical about the over-emphasis on winning and 
losing, even at the level of eighth-grade soccer his grandson plays, Duke 
cannot deny the impact it has on him to have to see his teams lose. 
</P>
<P>
"I go in the dressing rooms," Duke said. "I try to go to our team's dressing 
room after any game I see in the conference. I always go down after the Rose 
Bowl game. And there's a disappointment in there after a loss. People who are 
critical of our bowl record, or even people who are critical of the team's 
performance that day, don't have to see, first hand, the terrible 
disappointment that is felt by the players and the coaches who have put so much 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy up in the stands who has been tailgating all day and who thinks he has 
all the answers, doesn't have to see what losing does to the players and the 
coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Or what it does to Duke, who has come back up to the pressbox looking so 
distressed that writers have joked about keeping an eye on him so he doesn't 
jump from the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Duke tries to keep smiling. "Tom Hansen (commissioner of the Pacific 10) tells 
me I'm a very good loser," Duke said. "I tell him, that's because I've had a 
lot of practice." 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't get easier. 
</P>
<P>
As he flipped through the pages of his memories, Duke could not seem to 
separate good times and bad times in Southern California from the wins and the 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you the contrast," Duke said. "The first year we were here and 
something that happened just last year make a good contrast." 
</P>
<P>
The first year Duke and his wife, Martha, came out for the Rose Bowl game, 
Stanford beat Michigan. It was after the 1971 season. 
</P>
<P>
For the Duke family, it was an emotional time, anyway. He had become Big Ten 
commissioner on Sept. 1, 1971, after 8 years as commissioner of the Big Eight 
and 11 years of service in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. office. They 
had just sold their home of 19 years to make the move to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
After all those years of going to Miami every holiday season for the Orange 
Bowl, they were in Southern California -- where it was raining. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan team was having to practice in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was looking too rosy. 
</P>
<P>
And then, the all-important game. In the final minutes of the game, Michigan 
got a safety to go ahead of Stanford, 12-10. But Don Bunce, the Stanford 
quarterback, took Stanford down the field and Rod Garcia kicked a field goal to 
beat the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
"Martha and I had been talking about how the final standings would go if 
Michigan lost, and we knew that Big Eight teams were going to be 1-2-3," Duke 
said. "We'd been talking about that for days. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Lawrence Welk was grand marshal of the parade that year, and he was at 
the Tournament House that night for the party. He stood up there and said, 'A-1 
and a-2 and a-3,' and Martha burst into tears." 
</P>
<P>
Not a happy memory. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes decided in subsequent years to skip the party at the Tournament 
House. It was a celebration. Often the Big Ten contingent didn't feel like 
celebrating. The Dukes would go back to the presidential suite at the Pasadena 
Hilton to spend the evening with Big Ten guests. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, when Michigan State beat USC, they again skipped the Tournament 
House celebration. It wouldn't look right to show up only after a victory. 
</P>
<P>
So the Dukes were back in their suite that evening, savoring a victory that, 
admittedly, was a "blue collar win . . . a game we won after USC fumbled, but 
we'd lost a lot of games that way" when there was a knock at the door. 
</P>
<P>
"All the Rose Bowl officers -- Harriman Cronk and all the rest -- came to bring 
me my Rose Bowl watch," Duke said. "That was a highlight. They left their 
celebration to bring that to me, and I appreciated that." 
</P>
<P>
There were some points in their long relationship when some of the Rose Bowl 
folks were not too happy with Duke, when he sided with the movement to exclude 
the exclusivity clause from the Rose Bowl contract. 
</P>
<P>
Some feared that allowing Big Ten and Pac-10 teams to compete in other bowls, 
also, would dilute the impact of the Rose Bowl. Duke believed that the Rose 
Bowl, matching the champions of the conferences, would remain as strong as ever 
while letting more teams compete would be of benefit to both conferences. 
</P>
<P>
He was right, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, Big Ten and Pac-10 schools have claimed an average of 
40% of the total bowl pot of about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Duke points out that opening opportunities was good for parity in his 
conference, good for attendance, good for recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had just been named commissioner of the Big Eight, and I was only 34 
years old at the time, one of the first things I faced was the news that the 
Orange Bowl was terminating our exclusive contract," Duke said. "They wanted to 
be able to invite the top teams, to have a 'national championship' game. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports Illustrated wrote that the loss of that contract would be the death 
knoll of the Big Eight. Actually, it turned out to be a boon to the Big Eight. 
It opened up vistas for other bowls. We went to the Cotton Bowl, the Sugar Bowl 
and the Orange Bowl. It was great for our conference." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Rose Bowl changed its policy, and the Big Ten started to compete in 
other bowls in 1976, Big Ten schools have taken 56 bowl berths. 
</P>
<P>
Duke and his wife have been at a bowl game on New Year's Day for the last 26 
years. They might attend a bowl game just for fun next year. Or they might not. 
</P>
<P>
If he's not at the Rose Bowl next year, he says he'll miss it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to most of the bowl games at one time or another," Duke said. "I've 
been to all the major bowls -- Orange, Cotton, Sugar. . . . And this is not to 
degrade any of the others. But I think the Rose Bowl is special."

<P>
Rating the five best New Year's Day bowl games: 
</P>
<P>
1. Orange Bowl. Colorado can clinch the national championship, and should, 
against a Notre Dame team that usually stinks out the joint in Miami. The Irish 
will be in big trouble against the quicker Buffaloes if Rocket Ismail is slowed 
by a shoulder injury. . . . 2. Rose Bowl. Bo Schembechler's retirement makes 
this special. The Wolverines used to lose in Pasadena because they couldn't 
pass. Now they are well-balanced (2,380 yards running, 1,818 passing). But the 
key is the young USC quarterback, Todd Marinovich, who must regain his form 
after an off day against UCLA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
3. Fiesta Bowl. Florida State is playing better than anyone in the nation after 
losing its first two games. Coming off a rare win over Oklahoma, Nebraska will 
keep it close, high-scoring and entertaining. . . . 
</P>
<P>
4. Sugar Bowl. Kickoff will be about a half-hour after the Orange Bowl starts, 
and by the fourth quarter, Miami could be shooting for a national title. An 
upset might silence Bill Curry's critics at Alabama -- at least for a month or 
two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
5. Cotton Bowl. In Arkansas and Tennessee they care very much about this 
neighborhood brawl, but it will draw a yawn from the rest of the country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The best musical show will be in Pasadena, where the always powerful Michigan 
band is matched against colorful USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trojan wide receiver John Jackson has completed the grand slam of athletic and 
academic honors. A 3.30 GPA graduate in business who is working on his master's 
degree, Jackson has won an NCAA postgraduate scholarship, been named to the 
NCAA Top Six and been selected as a National Football Foundation 
scholar-athlete, Woody Hayes scholar-athlete and first-team GTE academic 
All-American. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The rising star at NBC, Joel Meyers, will announce the Freedom Bowl on TV 
Saturday and the Rose Bowl on radio Monday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Florida running back Emmitt Smith will be the center of attention in the 
Freedom, but Washington center Bern Brostek is projected to be a first-round 
draft choice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The AFC and NFC wild-card games each would receive more attention if they were 
played on different days, but TV ratings are better on Sunday than on Saturday. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
By now, we've gotten used to playoffs without the Raiders, Dolphins and 
Cowboys. But no Bears, either? . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a couple of sleepers to make it to the Super Bowl, try 
the Rams and Browns. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Three of the top four offensive teams in the AFC didn't get into the playoffs 
-- and neither did three of the top five defensive teams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda says the first time he met Billy Martin was on the diamond. But the 
sport was boxing. "I was pitching for Kansas City against the Yankees in 1956," 
the Dodger manager recalled. "I threw at him. A fight broke out. It wasn't long 
after, though, that we became friends. You just had to be in the same room with 
the guy for an hour to love him." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda on Martin, the manager: "He knew how to motivate people. That made him 
a winner." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his numbers, Brett Hull isn't half the hockey player his father 
Bobby was. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The change in the style of play in the NHL is reflected in the statistics of 
Doug Harvey, the Hall of Fame defenseman who died Tuesday at 65. The most goals 
he scored in a single season was nine. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Robb Stauber, the goaltender out of the University of Minnesota who made Mark 
Fitzpatrick expendable, still hasn't played for the Kings' New Haven farm club 
because of groin and back injuries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Jerry Burns and Burgess Meredith. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The more thoroughbred racing there is, the less predictable it gets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What a pleasure it is to hear Trevor Denman call the races at Santa Anita 
again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Their last 0.2-second defeat to the Celtics was just another step in the 
learning process for the young Clippers. What they learned is that it helps to 
be part of the NBA Establishment when crucial calls are made by officials. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Who else but Larry Bird and Magic Johnson did you expect to decide the outcomes 
of two games in the same city the same night with free throws? . . . 
</P>
<P>
NFL take note: The Clipper-Celtic game was long by NBA standards. It lasted 2 
hours 15 minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to rap the Boston hierarchy for not keeping up with the Lakers, but 
this would be a much different club if not for the Len Bias tragedy and the 
defection of Brian Shaw to Italy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No team with Akeem Olajuwon in the lineup should have a losing record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michigan will be the sentimental favorite on the moon Monday. Three Apollo 15 
crew members who are graduates of the university left a UM flag there.

USC, UCLA IN VULNERABLE SPOTS; 
</P>
<P>
PAC-10 POWERS OF '80S LOSE STAR QUARTERBACKS TO NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC and UCLA have been the teams of the '80s in the Pacific-10 Conference. But 
as the decade draws to a close, the competition is gaining ground. 
</P>
<P>
USC has split four Rose Bowl games this decade, while UCLA is 3-0. The only 
other Pac-10 teams to play in Pasadena during that time are Washington and 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, USC won its first 10 games before losing its regular-season finale 
to Notre Dame and falling to Michigan in the Rose Bowl. UCLA also finished 10-2 
and won an NCAA-record seventh straight bowl game, beating Arkansas 17-3 in the 
Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But both Pac-10 powers could be vulnerable this season because their star 
quarterbacks have gone to the NFL. UCLA's Troy Aikman signed a rich contract 
with the Dallas Cowboys, and USC's Rodney Peete was drafted by the Detroit 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss of the multi-talented Peete, USC Coach Larry Smith does not 
plan to change his offense much this season. With talented tailback Aaron 
Emanuel and fullback LeRoy Holt, the Trojans once again stress the running 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance to have our best running game since I came here," Smith said. 
"We have our top five rushers from last year back." 
</P>
<P>
The starting quarterback figures to be either Pat O'Hara, a fourth-year junior 
who completed five of seven passes last season, or redshirt freshman Todd 
Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara came out of spring practice as the first-stringer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about our quarterback position," Smith said. "I'm really not that 
worried about it right now. My main concern is not the quarterbacks, but to 
make sure we get the whole team playing team football." 
</P>
<P>
With Aikman gone, Jimmy Bonds and Bret Johnson are battling for the starting 
quarterback job at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always needed two quarterbacks and have always used two quarterbacks," 
Bruins Coach Terry Donahue said. "I think both of them are good players and 
both are capable of playing." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is a redshirt freshman while Bonds is a third-year sophomore who 
completed four of seven passes for 42 yards in limited duty last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we'll do differently, particularly early, is try to be a better 
running team and not put as much pressure on the quarterback to do things that 
Troy did," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Tailbacks Brian Brown, Shawn Wills and Kevin Williams will run behind an 
experienced offensive line. Wills ran for 622 yards as a freshman last season, 
while Brown gained 410 yards. Williams, one of the most highly recruited prep 
players a year ago, wound up redshirting because of hamstring problems. 
</P>
<P>
Like UCLA and USC, Washington State must adjust to the loss of its star 
quarterback. Timm Rosenbach, who led the nation in passing and guided the 
Cougars to a 9-3 record last season, skipped his senior year to enter the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State also has a new coach, Mike Price from Weber State. Price 
replaces Dennis Erickson, who went to Miami after Jimmy Johnson left to become 
the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon could challenge if junior quarterback Bill Musgrave remains healthy. The 
Ducks started 6-1 last year, but Musgrave suffered a broken collarbone and they 
lost their last five. 
</P>
<P>
Washington finished 6-5 last season and missed a bowl game for the first time 
in 10 seasons. Senior quarterback Cary Conklin returns for Coach Don James, 
who's entering his 15th season coaching at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Other returning Pac-10 quarterbacks include Troy Taylor at California, Jason 
Palumbis at Stanford, Paul Justin at Arizona State and Ronald Veal at Arizona.

BOWL RECORD PROVIDES INCENTIVE FOR UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unable to beat Washington State to maintain its No. 1 ranking, or to beat USC 
to earn a trip to the Rose Bowl, UCLA can still make 1988 a noteworthy season 
by beating Arkansas today in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Outscoring the eighth-ranked Razorbacks, who were 10-0 before losing their 
regular-season finale to Miami, would give the Bruins bowl victories in seven 
consecutive seasons, a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Terry Donahue has dangled the record as incentive for his ninth-ranked 
Bruins, who were No. 1 for 2 weeks in October before staggering through the 
final month of the season, losing 2 of 4 games to finish 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
"In my eyes now, the fact that the national championship slipped away, the fact 
that we aren't the conference champion, the season is nowhere near as 
successful as I had hoped it would be, based on my expectations as they built 
throughout the season," Donahue said. "The emotions of the moment tell me that 
we've got to win this game or the season's a failure." 
</P>
<P>
And beating Arkansas, Donahue said, will not be easy, in spite of the opinions 
of the oddsmakers, who favor UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of obstacles to overcome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Donahue, the Razorbacks have several psychological advantages. 
Donahue seems to say that about every opponent, of course, but in this case he 
seems to harbor legitimate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas has worked toward this day since 1976, when it beat Georgia in its 
last Cotton Bowl appearance, whereas UCLA accepted a bid as the first team from 
the West Coast to appear in the Cotton Bowl since 1949 only as a consolation 
prize after losing a Rose Bowl showdown to USC, 31-22. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas might be inspired by a natural resentment toward UCLA's 
All-American quarterback, Troy Aikman, who has received most of the attention 
from fans and the local media because the Dallas Cowboys are expected to make 
him the No. 1 pick next April in the National Football League draft. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A majority of the fans in the sold-out, 72,032-seat Cotton Bowl stadium 
will wear funny red hats shaped like hogs' heads. Whereas about 35,000 tickets 
to the game were sold in Arkansas, fewer than 3,000 were sold at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas might simply be better than advertised. The Razorbacks, some 
believe, were underrated, never rising above eighth in the national rankings. 
The Southwest Conference champions, in fact, earned more respect from their 
loss to Miami than they did from their 10 victories. And they might have beaten 
the second-ranked Hurricanes if safety Steve Atwater hadn't dropped a potential 
interception in the Arkansas end zone with fewer than 6 minutes to play. 
Miami's Carlos Huerta then kicked a 20-yard field goal with 5:38 left to give 
the Hurricanes an 18-16 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great opportunity here," Donahue said. "I think the obstacles and 
the barriers for this game are a great deal different and more challenging than 
some we've had in past (bowl) games." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, though, isn't the only one facing hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Arkansas arrived in Dallas last week, Coach Ken Hatfield had 
suspended, for unspecified reasons, All-Southwest Conference offensive guard 
Freddie Childress and defensive tackle Wayne Martin, an All-American and the 
defensive player of the year in the Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Neither will play today. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Razorbacks have had to deal with speculation about Hatfield, who 
reportedly is among the candidates to replace Vince Dooley at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, we'll decide about the future," said Hatfield, who has 
sidestepped all questions about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
And the Razorbacks, despite their record, were hardly a dominant team, winning 
6 games by 8 points or less, including a 21-14 victory over 0-11 Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just about one step better than everybody we played and then we got to 
Miami and were about one step behind," Hatfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by quarterback Quinn Grovey, who led the Southwest Conference in 
passing efficiency but passed for only 966 yards and 4 touchdowns, the 
Razorbacks' flexbone attack ranked third in the SWC in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks also ranked third in total defense. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, meanwhile, caught the nation's attention with its 41-28 dismantling of 
Nebraska in September, moved to No. 1 after Notre Dame knocked off Miami in 
October and rolled to a 7-0 start, its best in 22 years, before squandering a 
27-6 third-quarter lead in a 34-30 loss to Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by less-than-impressive victories over Oregon and Stanford, 
in which Aikman endured his least productive games, and the loss to USC, in 
which Aikman was brilliant, throwing for 317 yards and 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hatfield said that UCLA was more balanced offensively than Miami and 
called the Bruins "as good a team as there is in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Unless they beat Arkansas, though, their season will be looked upon in some 
circles as a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can view 9-2 as an unsuccessful season, I'm not sure that I'm not as 
guilty as the next person in contributing to the madness," Donahue said. "It 
was a good year, but it just didn't meet all of our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
A victory over the Razorbacks would ease the burden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cotton Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
Of the 4 other schools that won bowl games in 6 consecutive seasons, Georgia 
Tech and Alabama had their streaks ended by Southwest Conference schools. 
Georgia Tech lost to Arkansas, 14-7, in the 1960 Gator Bowl and Alabama lost to 
Texas, 14-12, in the 1982 Cotton Bowl. USC and Nebraska also won bowl games in 
6 straight seasons. . . . In the only meeting between the schools, UCLA and 
Arkansas played to a 10-10 tie in the 1978 Fiesta Bowl. . . . UCLA is listed as 
a 5 1/2-point favorite. . . . The extended forecast called for a cloudy sky 
with temperatures in the low 50s and a 20% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is playing in a bowl game for the eighth consecutive season, the longest 
current string in the Pacific 10 Conference. Its record in bowl games is 8-7-1, 
including a 6-2-1 record under Coach Terry Donahue. . . . Arkansas is 9-12-3 in 
bowl games, including a 1-3 record under Coach Ken Hatfield and a 2-3-1 record 
in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Eric Smith of UCLA will miss the game with knee and ankle 
injuries, Donahue said Sunday, and will be replaced in the starting lineup by 
Billy Ray. . . . UCLA also will be without inside linebacker Chance Johnson, 
who is out with a knee injury, reserve linebacker Stacy Argo and reserve 
defensive back Randy Beverly. . . . Eric Ball, who has been bothered by an 
ankle injury, will start at tailback and reserve wide receiver David Keating 
might play despite a hamstring injury, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Henry will take the place of suspended right guard Freddie Childress in 
Arkansas' starting lineup, although James Morris will move over from left guard 
to take Childress' regular place in the line. . . . Suspended defensive tackle 
Wayne Martin, who led the Razorbacks with 13 sacks, will be replaced by 
sophomore Tony Ollison. . . . James Rouse, who was Arkansas' leading rusher 
before missing the Razorbacks' last 5 games with a knee injury, is expected to 
play, but will not start.

IF IRISH DEFEAT BUFFALOES, THEY COULD RATE A SHOT AT NO. 1

<P>
Colorado could simplify the voting process in the final Associated Press and 
United Press International college football polls by beating Notre Dame Monday 
night in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes, the current No. 1-ranked team, would remain unbeaten, and who 
really cares which teams finish second through fourth in the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
All remaining contenders -- Miami, Michigan and Notre Dame -- would have at 
least one loss. 
</P>
<P>
However, if Notre Dame beats Colorado, Miami beats Alabama in the Sugar Bowl 
and Michigan beats USC in the Rose Bowl, the voting could become more 
subjective. 
</P>
<P>
In that event, it would seem logical to elevate Miami, now ranked No. 2, to the 
top spot, considering that it already had beaten Notre Dame, which had disposed 
of the current No. 1 team, Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
However, Notre Dame, now No. 4, which has a strong national following, may get 
some support from reporters (Associated Press) and coaches (United Press 
International) for the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
There also could be voting backlash against Miami for reasons that have nothing 
to do with results. The Hurricanes, with their swaggering and finger-pointing 
on the field and previous "convict" image, may be a distasteful choice for the 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Voters might be looking for any excuse not to promote Miami to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of Notre Dame's popularity was evident in a recent USA Today 
phone-in poll. Answering the question of who is the nation's No. 1 team, 1,063 
voted for Notre Dame, 611 for Michigan, 498 for Miami and only 443 for 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler says it's "a shot in the dark" for his team to 
get the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
However, considering that Schembechler is retiring after the Rose Bowl game and 
that he has never won a national championship in his 21 years as the 
Wolverines' coach despite an impressive record, he and his Michigan team could 
be a sentimental choice to jump from No. 3 to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
That seems unlikely, though, because Notre Dame beat Michigan in a 
season-opening game. 
</P>
<P>
In tiebreakers for conference championships, head-to-head results are the 
determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
That is not necessarily a guideline for the voting in the wire service polls. 
</P>
<P>
Take 1978, for example. USC beat Alabama, 24-14, in the third game of the 
season and then later lost to Arizona State. Alabama didn't lose another game, 
and neither did USC. 
</P>
<P>
Since USC beat Alabama, there was an obvious tiebreaker in the voting for No. 
1. However, the AP poll selected Alabama as national champion. The UPI poll 
tabbed USC as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the possibility that there could be split national champions again 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, the UPI poll has not recognized teams that are on NCAA probation. 
The AP poll doesn't make such a distinction. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, USC was designated national champion by UPI at the end of the season. 
Oklahoma, which was on probation, was AP's national champion. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it isn't a perfect system but one that could be settled by playoffs 
such as in college basketball. Although a playoff system has been discussed, 
and some coaches favor it, nothing has been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The major bowls are opposed to a playoff formula, figuring that it might damage 
their prestige if, say, the Rose Bowl or the Orange Bowl were designated as 
semifinal NCAA playoff games, rather than the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
One final thought: What if there are some tie games in the strategic bowl 
games? That's another problem for the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Gamesmanship in the Orange Bowl began Dec. 22 when Colorado Coach Bill 
McCartney brought his team to Miami. Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, whose team 
didn't arrive until Monday night, has said that preparation is difficult at a 
bowl site because of bowl-related activities and distractions. 
</P>
<P>
"All you try to do is control damage," Holtz said. "You don't even know if the 
ball is blown up or stuffed." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney interpreted Holtz's comments as second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Holtz questions our strategy in coming down here early and spending time 
with the beautiful people of Miami," McCartney said. "I don't understand that. 
(Former Oklahoma coach) Barry Switzer said he always came down early and felt 
like it was the ideal way to prepare his squad. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Switzer is the guy I want to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney said the Buffaloes came to Miami early because cold weather and snow 
in Colorado made it difficult for them to practice at home. 
</P>
<P>
The players seem to be enjoying the change in climate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for us to come down here and get used to the weather," wide 
receiver Jeff Campbell said. "We're coming from a place where there isn't any 
oxygen to a place where there's a lot of oxygen. So we have to get used to 
stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback Darian Hagan, a Los Angeles native: "This is good weather to 
practice in. We're living it up right now." 
</P>
<P>
Said McCartney: "I'm not in any way concerned about being down here too long." 
</P>
<P>
Your move, Lou. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What is the name of the only bowl game ever played in Havana, and 
which teams participated? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Monday's Rose Bowl game will be played on the 50th anniversary of the 1940 game 
between USC and Tennessee. The game was unique in that it marked the second 
consecutive year that USC defeated Rose Bowl opponents who came into the game 
unbeaten, untied and unscored upon. 
</P>
<P>
USC beat Duke, 7-3, in the 1939 game on Doyle Nave's last-minute touchdown pass 
to Al Krueger. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans then spoiled Tennessee's perfect record, 14-0, behind the running 
and passing of tailback Ambrose Schindler. 
</P>
<P>
USC's victory prompted Henry McLemore of United Press to write: 
</P>
<P>
"They raise them rugged out here. Perhaps nature sees that they do in order 
that they will be able to withstand earthquakes, unusual weather and the water 
that comes out of the taps. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lesson to be learned from the Rose Bowl game. There is no sense in 
betting on a team that buys its clothes in the boys' department to beat a team 
that has to shave twice a day and is fitted for suits in the adult or grown-up 
section." 
</P>
<P>
It was the last Rose Bowl game for USC Coach Howard Jones. He died in 1941, 
leaving a legacy of five Rose bowl victories without a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
If Miami wins the national championship, Dennis Erickson will become the first 
coach in 41 years to get the title in his first year at a school. Michigan's 
Bennie Oosterbaan was the last coach to do it, in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Bacardi Bowl on Jan. 1, 1937, when Auburn and Villanova 
played to a 7-7 tie.

MIKE DOWNEY: SUDDENLY, THE MAN IS AN EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They all laughed last year when I picked UCLA to defeat USC. "At what?" they 
asked. "Synchronized swimming?" One guy in my office who attended USC wondered 
aloud how I could write such a thing and expect to be taken seriously. Hey, 
babe, I don't like to be taken seriously. I just like to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, they would have laughed just as hard last year had I picked UCLA to 
defeat Cal State Fullerton . . . or Cal Tech . . . or Kal Daniels. Not only did 
UCLA's 1989 team not belong in the Rose Bowl, it couldn't have been elected 
best float in the Rose parade. The queen's dress had better material than Terry 
Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, that didn't stop me. Bravely, I went with UCLA. On USC's field, yet. I 
demonstrated my courage. I danced with wolves. I dared the men of Troy to spit 
in my eye. But after the game, they couldn't. Their chins were too low. 
</P>
<P>
USC lost to UCLA, 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
I know, I know; that's a tie. But I know and you know -- and you know that 
everybody else knows -- that the Trojans got their helmets handed to them. They 
had excellent football players -- even beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl -- but 
they couldn't beat UCLA. The Bruins tied them up, tied them down. 
</P>
<P>
It was the definite highlight of a UCLA season in which the players protected 
Donahue's consecutive streak of victories in bowl games by not playing in one. 
This is a major accomplishment, by the way, in an American era in which bowl 
games outnumber Taco Bells and 7-Elevens, two to one. 
</P>
<P>
For USC, last year's game was a terrible disappointment, mostly because from 
November to January, all the student body had to look forward to was . . . 
yuck, basketball. 
</P>
<P>
And now, 12 months later, they're back! . . . Trojans and Bruins! . . . you 
know 'em, you love 'em! . . . well, you know 'em! . . . to clash in college 
football's greatest rivalry! . . . unless, of course, you attended Michigan, 
Ohio State, Harvard, Yale, Navy, Army, Stanford, Cal, Texas, Texas A&amp;M, 
Wabash or DePauw! . . . Saturday in Pasadena, 12:30 p.m., be there! . . . (or 
be somewhere else). 
</P>
<P>
And I know what you're asking: 
</P>
<P>
"Mike, who's gonna win?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, first off, let me tell you right up front that I haven't the slightest 
idea where you get the nerve to think you know me well enough to call me by my 
first name. And next off, look: I have no personal stake in this game. I did 
not attend UCLA. I did not go to USC. The college I attended barely had indoor 
toilets, much less football. We didn't even have cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
Read my lips: I don't care which team wins. 
</P>
<P>
But what the heck, I'll take a shot. It's the least I can do. (The most I can 
do being early retirement.) My boss is pretty worried that I'll insult 
somebody. My boss is one of those guys who believes in being overly respectful 
and polite and mealy-mouthed about every college football team in America. My 
boss went to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Here's my USC-UCLA scouting report: 
</P>
<P>
TOMMY vs. TODD: Tommy (Auto) Maddox, the UCLA quarterback, has had a better 
season than Todd (Classes? I Don't Need No Stinking Classes) Marinovich, and I 
predict that if Marinovich should decide to turn pro by the end of the season, 
Maddox should decide to turn pro by the end of Saturday's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy the gun has been one fresh freshman. Only two things kept UCLA from 
having a miserable season, and one of them was Maddox. The other one was 
Stanford, which prides itself on keeping just about everybody from having a 
miserable season. 
</P>
<P>
As for Todd, should he even start? Larry Smith takes out Shane Foley after 
touchdown drives. Does Foley use too many plays when he leads USC to 
touchdowns? Does he drink too much Gatorade on the sideline? Does he wipe his 
dirty hands on the coach's shirt? What? Come back, Shane, come back! 
</P>
<P>
COACH RED vs. COACH BLUE: I call them that because Smith is always mad and 
Donahue is always sad. 
</P>
<P>
At least, it seems that way. Larry dislikes agents rubbing elbows with his 
players and NFL scouts attending practice and referees suspending games because 
of thunderstorms. Terry thinks everybody in the media is negative unless the 
next day's headline reads: UCLA LOSES AGAIN, BUT TRIES REALLY, REALLY HARD. 
</P>
<P>
This game means a possible Liberty Bowl trip for UCLA, putting Donahue's bowl 
streak on the line. The Liberty Bowl is in Memphis. If UCLA wins Saturday, the 
most valuable player should face the TV cameras and say: "I'm going to 
Graceland!" 
</P>
<P>
BATTLE OF THE BANDS: Advantage, USC. The UCLA team does not have a chance in 
hell to win this game, and might forfeit it, if the Trojan band plays that 
school song over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over 
and over and over, as is its custom. Saddam Hussein would surrender if 
subjected to similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
THE REAL ROSE BOWL: This is it. Lord knows you don't want to watch that thing 
coming up New Year's Day. What is it, Washington against Iowa? Boy, I can 
hardly wait. That game won't even interest people from Washington or Iowa. That 
game will have TV ratings like "Cop Rock." 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's big Troy-Donahue battle, I'll go with the Trojans by a couple of 
points. But I could be wrong. Could be three.

<P>
ROSE BOWL: MICHIGAN RUNNING BACK LEROY HOARD HAS FOUND A METHOD TO THE MADNESS 
AS A SUBJECT OF COACH BO SCHEMBECHLER'S TIRADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This will be the last week that Bo Schembechler ever yells at Leroy Hoard. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, as we know, is retiring as Michigan's coach after the Rose Bowl 
game against USC on Monday. Hoard, a junior, stays on -- a player molded and 
scolded by Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Bo's yelling, which he has done a lot in his 27 years as a head coach, hasn't 
always been music to Hoard's ears, but he has learned to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard, a 220-pound fullback-tailback, was the most valuable player in last 
January's Rose Bowl, a 22-14 Wolverine victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
He broke open the game in the fourth quarter with a 61-yard run that positioned 
Michigan for its clinching touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard gained 142 yards, averaging 7.5 a carry, and scored two touchdowns in 
that game, shredding a defense that had not allowed another running back to 
gain more than 100 yards during the season. 
</P>
<P>
With Tony Boles inactive because of knee surgery, Hoard will play tailback 
exclusively against USC instead of alternating at fullback and tailback. Hoard 
rushed for 724 yards, averaging almost five yards a carry, and six touchdowns 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
He is a power back with speed and was so impressive in the last Rose Bowl game 
that Ram Coach John Robinson told Schembechler, a close friend, that Hoard had 
the status of a No.1 draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard is a humble athlete who wasn't even sure he could play college football, 
let alone in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a friendly, outgoing sort who gets into Bo's doghouse occasionally 
by cutting a class. 
</P>
<P>
"Leroy hasn't given me any trouble; I've given Leroy trouble," Schembechler 
said. "He and I have had some disagreements, and I'm the head coach." 
</P>
<P>
That's vintage Bo. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler made it clear, though, that Hoard has never done anything 
seriously wrong at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard was a high school star in New Orleans, and he recalled what friends and 
other coaches told him about the Michigan coach while he was being recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"They said he's a mean guy, the toughest coach there is," Hoard said. "But he 
had a sweet voice. Then, when I got to Michigan, I was one of the first guys he 
yelled at, and it has been going on for four years." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard doesn't seem bothered by Bo's bombast. He seemingly takes it all in 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, though, when Schembechler's tirades upset him. 
</P>
<P>
"The freshmen used to scrimmage on Monday, and with Jarrod Bunch hurt, I was 
the only fullback," Hoard said. "Well, I fumbled, and the coach said, 'I'll be 
glad when Bunch gets back.' 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a freshman, things coaches say tend to get to you a lot more, 
because when you're older you realize they say things only to motivate you and 
you shouldn't take it personally." 
</P>
<P>
He says he understands Bo now. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of person that if he confronts you, he lets you defend yourself 
-- for a couple of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get a couple of words in, and I've been known to sneak in more than my 
share. But when I think about it now, it's no use. Just be quiet." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time last year, though, when Schembechler listened, according to 
Hoard. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me why he did everything," Hoard said. "I said, 'You can yell at me 
all you want,' because I knew he had a reason. For a long time I thought it was 
just me. Maybe I wasn't a good player." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard learned later that Schembechler is indiscriminate in his yelling, even 
though the running back's ears burned more than most. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview with the Detroit Free Press, Hoard was philosophical 
about his relationship with Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo taught me that when you do something wrong, you have to accept the 
consequences," he said. "Regardless of how great a game it is, school and the 
other things are more important." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard can joke about his years with Schembechler now that the coach is 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom came up for the Ohio State game and asked me why I had so many keys," 
Hoard said. "I said, 'This one is for my car and this one is for my apartment. 
This is for the mailbox and this is for Bo's doghouse.' Now I guess I'll have 
to give the key back." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Hoard was a renowned player at St. Augustine High School in New 
Orleans, he doubted his own ability and had his own priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I left Louisiana because I wanted to get away from home, even if I didn't play 
a lick of football in college, and I didn't think I would play," he said. "I 
wanted to travel, I wanted to see snow, I wanted to go to the Rose Bowl. There 
were a lot of things I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of all the schools I looked at, this was the only school that gave me 
academics, travel and a chance to go to California. I chose Michigan and I have 
no regrets." 
</P>
<P>
He learned that Schembechler is not effusive in his praise of players. 
</P>
<P>
For example, after his outstanding performance in the Rose Bowl, Schembechler 
told him that he played a good game but made some mistakes that would be 
evaluated at a film session. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler has been rather mellow on his last trip to the Rose Bowl and has 
praised Hoard -- to an extent. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hard to tackle and is a fine, fine runner," Schembechler said. "He gets a 
big play every game, too. But he has to play better without the ball, as a 
blocker, receiver and faker." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard agrees with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I'm standing around, but there are some points where I can 
improve to make myself a better player," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he improves as expected, then Hoard will probably be an NFL first-round 
draft choice after his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a longshot," Hoard said of an NFL career. "I didn't think I could play 
college football, but I made it this far. If my career were to end right now, 
I'd be satisfied."

ROSE BOWL NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
IF USC CAN'T TRIPP HIM, IT MUST FIND A WAY TO STOP WELBORNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sullivan Anthony Welborne III, better known as Tripp, for triple, is one of the 
nation's premier defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Michigan strong safety insists that basketball is his first love. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the ever-smiling, personable Welborne likes to tell the story about 
being recruited by Bo Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan coach watched Welborne play for his high school basketball team in 
Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart belongs to Michigan, but basketball is my favorite sport. I used to 
shoot a lot. No shot is a bad shot. If you're off, you got to shoot until 
you're on. If you're on, you got to keep shooting because you're on," Welborne 
reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
After a non-stop shooting spree, Welborne recalled that Schembechler told him 
he'd have to ice his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I always shoot like that.' He said, 'You shot it every time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now, Welborne, a junior All-American, is shooting down quarterbacks as 
Michigan's designated blitzer. 
</P>
<P>
In this year's 22-14 Rose Bowl victory over USC he made 10 tackles, intercepted 
a pass and forced a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
He was also prominent in his team's come-from-behind, 24-23 win over UCLA 
earlier this season with a 63-yard punt return. 
</P>
<P>
That was the turning-point game for Michigan, Welborne said, after a 
season-opening loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed our character, showed we could come back, and I think UCLA played 
the best game it played all year," Welborne said. "We didn't play our best 
game, but to come out with a win showed that we hung together. We never thought 
we were going to lose. It showed we can come back from adversity. The lesson 
is, never quit." 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl game will showcase two of the nation's best defensive backs -- 
Welborne and USC's Mark Carrier, a finalist for the Jim Thorpe award. 
</P>
<P>
Welborne and Carrier were roommates in a hotel during the taping of the Bob 
Hope television show, featuring 1989 All-American players. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about everything," Welborne said. "We talked about the practices we 
had. Our practices are so similar. He told us what they did, and I said, 
'That's the same thing we do.' So it's going to be a battle of the titans, 
everything is equal. The team with the fewest mistakes will win." 
</P>
<P>
As for Carrier, Welborne said: "I've seen him on film, and he's a great, great 
player who makes big plays when you need them." 
</P>
<P>
Welborne has also been impressed by USC quarterback Todd Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that he can't play the game because he's young. He can throw the ball 
and do the things necessary to win. He has proved it during the season. 
</P>
<P>
"So we have to go out and play as if he's a veteran, and in our minds, he is. 
He is one of the toughest quarterbacks I've seen outside of our own (Michael 
Taylor). He throws passes and gets hit in the chest, and he'll get right back 
up. That's the mark of a true competitor." 
</P>
<P>
"But, hopefully, he'll make some mistakes in the game and give us a break." 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing theme of the 76th Rose Bowl game is Schembechler's retirement. He 
said he's enjoying his last week of coaching and will be more cognizant of his 
health when he retires 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler had a heart attack before the 1970 Rose Bowl game with USC and has 
had two bypass operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not into my new life yet," he said. "But as soon as this is over I'm going 
to the treadmill, watch what I eat and lose weight. I figure this is my last 
fling." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler has been accommodating and seemingly relaxed during news 
conferences at his team's hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't even get irritated when someone suggested that there would be a hole 
in his career if he doesn't win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a hole in my career, as far as I'm concerned," he said. "It may be 
for other people. There's nothing I would have done any differently in my 
coaching career. I won some games, won some (Big Ten) championships, made a lot 
of friends, what the hell else do you want?" 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler also discounts the emotional factor of his team trying to win one 
final game for their coach. "We don't need that. We're playing in the Rose 
Bowl. We don't need any added incentive." 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Crisler was the last Michigan lame-duck coach to bring a team to the Rose 
Bowl. The Wolverines responded, beating USC, 49-0, in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith is in favor of sudden-death overtime in college football 
games as a tiebreaking procedure. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't believe that teams should battle for 60 minutes just to end up in a 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that season-ending 10-10 tie with UCLA is still frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC defensive tackle Dan Owens has started every game in his four years at the 
school, and the Rose Bowl will be his 48th in a row. . . . Marinovich, who was 
named freshman of the year by UPI and the Sporting News, is already seventh on 
USC's career passing list.

BOWL REPRESENTATIVES FLOCK TO USC

Even if USC lost twice in its last six games, it probably would be invited to a 
New Year's Day bowl game, Jim Brock, executive director of the Cotton Bowl, 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"USC's always been on our wish list," Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
"With three losses, I don't think they'd be out of our hunt. USC is definitely 
on our elite list. They're in the upper echelon. I'd be surprised if USC wasn't 
on everybody's list." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of eight bowl games -- the Cotton, Citrus, Holiday, Freedom, 
Sugar, Copper, Peach and John Hancock -- will be at the USC-Arizona game 
Saturday at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a marquee player in the quarterback (Todd Marinovich)," Brock said 
of the Trojans. "They've got other players who are going to be future stars in 
the NFL. They've got tradition, a great record since (Coach) Larry Smith has 
been there. They're appealing. I could see a potential USC-Texas or USC-Texas 
A&amp;M matchup (in the Cotton Bowl) as being a really marquee football game. 
</P>
<P>
"USC's always going to be in the elite bowl-invitation group. Any New Year's 
Day bowl would love to have them." 
</P>
<P>
According to research by the Pacific 10 Conference and the NFL, USC had 38 
players on opening-day NFL rosters this season, more than any other school.

FREEDOM BOWL'S STARR CALLS NEW SCOUTING RULE UNWORKABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Press boxes at college football games across the country will be minus a few 
orange and turquoise and Chartreuse sports jackets for at least another month. 
The jackets belong to postseason bowl scouts, who earlier this year agreed to 
stay away from games until Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Many welcomed the move. Others went along with it a bit more grudgingly; for 
instance, Tom Starr, executive director of the Dec. 30 Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's not a workable rule," Starr said this week from the game's 
headquarters in Anaheim. "There are too many loopholes in it. It was done more 
for the New Year's Day bowls than the non-New Year's Day games." 
</P>
<P>
Among the loopholes Starr is alluding to is that bowls with conference 
affiliations can send scouts to see games at conference sites, such as when 
Penn State visits Texas on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Or that bowls can visit the schools which participated in last year's game, 
giving the Fiesta Bowl clearance to play host to a party at Notre Dame this 
weekend. Or that any bowl can send scouts and have them sit in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the College Bowl Assn. meeting in San Diego last 
April, presumably to cut down on the speculation that begins every September 
and goes on until the invitations are sent out in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
It was also done to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not very cost-efficient for us," Starr said. "Take this weekend, for 
example. Normally, I could go to see Ohio State at USC and Michigan at UCLA. 
That's not to say we're going to get any of those teams. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, if Michigan and Ohio State drop out of the picture for some other 
games, we're going to have to scout them somewhere down the road." 
</P>
<P>
To the major bowls, the new rule will have little effect. 
</P>
<P>
"The word 'scouting' has been a misnomer," said Bruce Skinner, the Fiesta 
Bowl's executive director. "We're really on a sales mission. The only reason 
you went out in September is because the other guy was going out." 
</P>
<P>
"If this hadn't been done, you would have seen eight to 10 scouts at the 
Michigan-Notre Dame game last week," Cotton Bowl executive director Jim Brock 
said earlier this week from Dallas. "But in the long run, it doesn't change 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not for the major postseason games such as the Rose Bowl, which is 
committed to taking the Big 10 and Pac-10 champions. Or the Cotton, which takes 
the Southwest Conference winner and a highly ranked opponent. Or the Orange 
(Big Eight vs. independent) and Sugar (Southeastern vs. independent). 
</P>
<P>
But for the have-nots, it could turn into a big-time problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to scramble," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
Starr was reported to be scrambling last weekend. He was spotted at, and later 
quoted about, the Oregon State-Washington State game. Oops. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the Ohio State game at the Coliseum Saturday, USC Coach Larry Smith 
has an 0-4 record against Big 10 teams. 
</P>
<P>
This after Trojan coaches had combined to win 17 straight against the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
One team that needn't worry about the bowl picture is SMU, which came back from 
the so-called "death penalty" to win its first game since Nov. 15, 1986. The 
Mustangs beat Connecticut last Saturday in Dallas, 31-30. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been saying all year that 'You can't . . . you can't . . . you 
can't, but we did," SMU Coach Forrest Gregg said after his team of mostly 
first-year players overcame a 30-14 deficit going into the fourth quarter to 
beat the Division I-AA Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
The victory must have been even more gratifying for the one player who stayed 
around while the program was shut down. Fifth-year receiver Mitchell Glieber, 
the son of the late CBS sportscaster Frank Glieber, caught eight passes for 117 
yards, including a 43-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bowen, who transferred to Georgia and later returned, caught the 
game-winner, a four-yard pass with no time left. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M tailback Darren Lewis was a dark horse candidate for the Heisman 
Trophy this year, having been the nation's second-leading rusher last year 
(1,692 yards) behind Heisman winner Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State. But Lewis 
hasn't made it out of the gate, with only 150 yards in the Aggies' first three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
This week's game between unbeaten Arkansas (1-0) and undefeated Mississippi 
(3-0) marks the first time since the series was renewed in 1981 that both 
schools are unbeaten going into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Though second-ranked Miami has suddenly become the hottest football ticket in 
town, selling more season's tickets (52,000) than the Dolphins for the first 
time, Hurricanes fans can still be a tough sell. Junior quarterback Craig 
Erickson heard some boos during last week's 31-3 victory over the California 
Bears. Erickson threw four interceptions and three touchdown passes against the 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hear them, and I hope that's not true," first-year Miami Coach Dennis 
Erickson (no relation) said when asked about the boos. 
</P>
<P>
After throwing for 281 yards in his debut against Wisconsin two weeks ago, 
Erickson was being touted as having a more successful first outing than any of 
his four famous predecessors. But consider this: Jim Kelly had 280 yards 
against Penn State, while Bernie Kosar (223), Vinny Testaverde (278) and Steve 
Walsh (234) all opened up against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Erickson's yardage stat) looks good on TV," one Hurricane cynic said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one member of the Cal coaching staff wasn't impressed with the 
Hurricanes. "There are five teams in the Pac-10 better than Miami," linebacker 
coach Denny Creehan said. "Print that." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears didn't make any fans with a pizza shop near campus. After ordering 42 
large pies from a chain called "Fatboys" on Friday night before the team left 
for Miami, the shop's manager received a call after the pies had been made. The 
message: "Hold the pepperoni, and everything else". 
</P>
<P>
Did you see the feeble onside-kick attempt by Michigan with 4:08 remaining in 
last Saturday's 24-19 loss to Notre Dame in Ann Arbor? It went three yards, hit 
a Michigan player in the back of the leg, and the ball was awarded to the 
Fighting Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Many second-guessed the move, not the least of whom was Michigan Coach Bo 
Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler justified his decision to try it so early by saying that the 
Fighting Irish hadn't been passing (only two the entire game) and once they got 
possession "they'd . . . kill too much time." Also, the Wolverines only had one 
timeout left. But after what happened if I had to do it all over again, I 
promise I'd kick it deep." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of second-guessing some moves on that play, how about Notre Dame Coach 
Lou Holtz using starting quarterback Tony Rice on the front line of the return 
team. Holtz kiddingly calls that front line his "Allstate" team, because "we're 
in good hands." 
</P>
<P>
But don't you think the nation's top college football program can find anyone 
else with good hands besides Rice? 
</P>
<P>
Quote of the Week: From Iowa Coach Hayden Fry after the Hawkeyes lost at home 
to Oregon, 44-6: "I can imagine every other team on our schedule licking their 
chops after this score. We've done a number on a lot of foes over the years, 
and this will be payback time for them."

HE WAS A TOWER OF POWER ON USC'S WINNING DRIVE; 
</P>
<P>
MVP: RICKY ERVINS, WHO CARRIED THE FOOTBALL 30 TIMES FOR 126 YARDS, SAYS THE 
TROJANS WORE DOWN THE WOLVERINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When USC needed a big play on the ground, they ran a simple off-tackle blast 
with tailback Ricky Ervins carrying the ball behind the blocking of fullback 
Leroy Holt. 
</P>
<P>
In the Trojans' playbook, the play is called "86," which calls for quarterback 
Todd Marinovich to roll outside his strongside tackle and hand off to Ervins. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing fancy, just power football. But against Michigan in Monday's Rose Bowl 
game, it was a play that buried the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
With a first down on Michigan's 14-yard line with 1:21 remaining, the Trojans 
again called on Ervins. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be the last time they would need the Rose Bowl game MVP. 
Behind Holt and pulling strongside guard Mark Tucker, Ervins powered into the 
Wolverines' secondary and received a key block from Gary Wellman. He ran over 
Michigan All-American safety Tripp Welborne at the seven-yard line and 
high-stepped into the end zone, ending USC's two-game losing streak in the Rose 
Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
"All game long, they couldn't stop it," Ervins said about the "86" play. "We 
just wore them down at the end." 
</P>
<P>
On the final drive, USC needed 11 plays to travel 75 yards, but after reaching 
Michigan's 24-yard line, the Trojans were content to keep the ball on the 
ground to set up a game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
But in the huddle before Ervins' touchdown, the Trojans were confident that 
they could score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd came into the huddle and told us that we are going to score on this 
play," Ervins said. "All I said was, 'Oh really?' " 
</P>
<P>
What made Marinovich so sure of his prediction was the Trojans' previous 
blocking success with the play. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the play) worked all day," Marinovich said. "I told the line to stay on 
their blocks a little longer and he (Ervins) will score, just like he did." 
</P>
<P>
With All-Pacific 10 tight end Scott Galbraith helping senior tackle Bill 
Schultz on a double-team block of Michigan defensive tackle Sylvester Stanley, 
the Trojans were able to open a hole for Holt and Tucker to clear for Ervins. 
</P>
<P>
"We were this close from breaking it every time we had ran it," Galbraith said, 
holding his thumb and index finger an inch apart. "Their defensive line was big 
and strong, but I was surprised that they were so blockable." 
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback coach Ray Dorr, who did most of the play calling from the press 
box, said that Coach Larry Smith called for the winning play. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Smith said that he wanted to run the ball off-tackle to run off some of 
the clock," Dorr said. "When I heard he had made the call, I said 'Great.' It 
wasn't a hard call." 
</P>
<P>
USC did not use the play until its sixth game against California. 
</P>
<P>
"The play has always worked for us," Tucker said. "And today, we knew that 
Ricky was close to breaking it into the end zone every time we ran it. 
</P>
<P>
"They never made any kind of adjustments and they never were able to stop it. 
When I pull around like that, it becomes like a sweep for me." 
</P>
<P>
Ervins, a junior, began the season as third-string tailback. On his first "86" 
carry, Ervins gained 12 yards. He carried 30 times for 126 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line was blocking great all game," Ervins said, who used to work 
as a Rose Bowl parking attendant when he played at Pasadena Muir High. "Early 
in the game I was not hitting the right holes, but they where there. It was 
just up to me to make the runs." 
</P>
<P>
It was Ervins' eighth 100-yard rushing game of the season and he finished with 
1,395 yards, 12th in school history. He joins Charles White (1979 and 1980), 
Sam Cunningham (1973), O.J. Simpson (1968) and Erny Pinckett (1932) as Trojan 
running backs named Rose Bowl game MVP.

JIM MURRAY: BO'S FAREWELL IS BY THE BOOK; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE LOSS, BO WON'T GO OUT LIKE A LAMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
It would have been a shame for Bo Schembechler's career to end in a tie. A tie 
is -- what? A dance with your sister, a kiss from a French general, a card game 
with your aunt? A title fight shouldn't end in a draw, a war shouldn't end in a 
stalemate at Panmunjom. A great career shouldn't end in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Golfers don't lay up in U.S. Opens, cleanup hitters don't bunt in the World 
Series, tennis players don't send up lobs in the fifth set at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
And Bo Schembechler didn't fall on the ball in the 76th Rose Bowl Monday. He 
went out with his guns out, his boots on. He didn't say "I'll play these." He 
faded the shooter. He wanted to go out the way he came in -- breathing 
defiance, daring the tiger, knocking the chip off the shoulder of the bully. 
His way. 
</P>
<P>
So, Bo didn't go out with a whimper. His team didn't tie one for the old Bo. Bo 
didn't even punt. Bo didn't just call. Bo bumped the pot, didn't stand on any 
18. He went for the pin. 
</P>
<P>
So, he didn't go out with a any chicken-salad tie. He went out a loser. 
</P>
<P>
The situation was this: Bo's Michigan team had somehow managed to tie the 
score, 10-10. No one knows how. USC was faster, deeper and, on the whole, 
niftier, than Bo's team. But they kept shooting themselves in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with about 7:30 to play, the situation was this: Bo's team had the ball on 
its 46-yard line, fourth down and two to go. You punt in that situation. Even 
if you're behind. Tied, you punt for certain. 
</P>
<P>
Bo didn't. His punter took the ball and set sail around left end for 24 yards 
to USC's 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
There goes the old ballgame, right? I mean, from there Michigan goes in to 
score, chewing up the clock as it goes. A game-winning call has just been made. 
A field goal at least, right? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you have to understand Bo and the Rose Bowl. What the famine was to Job, 
the plague to Joseph, the Rose Bowl was to Bo -- a hoodoo. A cross to bear. 
</P>
<P>
Bo's first Rose Bowl game, he had a heart attack. And the situation went 
downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a game, it was a jinx. Bo lost two Rose Bowl games because enemy 
teams failed to punt on fourth down in their own territory. Stanford did it to 
him in 1972. Washington did it in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
So, Bo finally turned the tables? Guess again. As the play is finished, this 
little yellow handkerchief comes fluttering out on the field. Play nullified. 
Victory nullified. Ten-yard penalty. Bo is entitled to say, "Me again, huh, 
God?" 
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines, Bo goes quietly crazy. He swells up with rage, charges the 
official. He is berserk. 
</P>
<P>
Bad Bo. Fifteen-yard penalty. Move the ball back to the Michigan 21. 
</P>
<P>
Now, punt. Now, fold the hand. Take back the blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
That was the pivotal part of the game. Bottom line: Bo loses again. He's 2-8 in 
the Rose Bowl. This is a coach who is 194-47-5 at Michigan. He was good enough 
to come to 10 Rose Bowls. He always showed up with a smart, well-drilled, 
resourceful, take-no-prisoners, coal yard type of football team. 
Over-achievers, really. 
</P>
<P>
He may have cost his team this Rose Bowl. The resultant punt, after Bo's 
tantrum and penalty, from the 21 is barely adequate. USC is in position to 
mount a closing drive that produced a touchdown with 1:10 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
The betting in the press interview room is even-money whether Bo will show up 
after this dismal loss. His mentor, the late Woody Hayes, would have stayed in 
the bunker and licked his wounds and cursed the Fates -- to say nothing of the 
refs. 
</P>
<P>
If he does show up, the betting is 1-to-5 he'll be coming into the room like a 
crashing plane. Aflame and spewing destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Bo is smiling as he enters the room. He is leaving the Rose Bowl as he entered 
it -- a loser. 
</P>
<P>
Only he doesn't act like one. Bo is downright jovial. His team is sobbing in 
the dressing room, he admits, but Bo is still full of fight. Bo doesn't cry. Bo 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
It is reminiscent of the time Joe Louis lay in a locker room after being 
knocked out by Rocky Marciano. Around him, people are tearing their hair, 
ripping their garments, crying out to the heavens. Louis opened an eye, looked 
up. "Hey!" he protested. "I knocked out lots of guys!" 
</P>
<P>
Bo didn't go out crying. He knocked out lots of guys, too. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't forgive the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all," he said, "we didn't deserve to win the game. We were miserable 
in the first half. I don't think we played well all day. It surprised me we 
gave up so many yards. Was SC faster than us? Well, we didn't think so going 
in." 
</P>
<P>
The call that cost him all chance at the 1990 Rose Bowl game was not so 
charitably viewed by Bo. "Most unbelievable call," Bo said, shaking his head. 
But he was smiling as he said it. "It was the most ridiculous call ever and, if 
I see the films and decide it was justified, I will be glad to retract. Was it 
a Pac-10 official? Naturally! But I will say that the worst call ever made on 
me here was by a Big Ten official once. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, one guy said it was called because of blocking below the waist. Another 
said it was old-fashioned holding. I'll guarantee you it was a late call. 
</P>
<P>
"Will they take it up with the supervisory officials? Listen, I want you to 
know, in the history of the game, according to supervisory officials, there has 
never been a bad call. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know what my humble opinion is? My humble opinion is that the game 
has passed up (the capabilities) of all amateur officials. It's too fast, it's 
too complex. It should have competent, professional officials." 
</P>
<P>
So, the Rose Bowl is not going to have Bo Schembechler to kick around any more. 
It's probably fitting he went out the way he came in. The Rose Bowl remained 
his bete noire to the end, the cloud over his head, his personal hex. 
</P>
<P>
Bo never got the hang of it. He never lost by more than a touchdown except once 
when he lost by 10 points -- to UCLA in '83. He never flinched, got reckless, 
or even played the game of a desperate man. The Rose Bowl always knew it was in 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Bo could beat Ohio State, Bo could win Big Ten titles, Bo could even beat Notre 
Dame if it came to that. Bo was just overmatched by a hex, not a team. 
Actually, he almost beat USC -- and the hex -- Monday. He took his shot. The 
Rose Bowl just got on its broom and flew away, cackling. The old bawd never 
gave Bo an honest cut of the cards. 
</P>
<P>
Bo will miss the Rose Bowl. But not as much as the Rose Bowl will miss Bo.

Growing up in Birmingham, Mich., near Ann Arbor, Mike Lodish was pressured 
extensively to play for the Michigan Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
But he never regretted enrolling at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to UCLA and Michigan and I came out West for some reasons I don't 
want to discuss," said Lodish, a 6-foot-3, 260-pound senior defensive tackle. 
"I enjoyed the (UCLA) coaching staff, the way I was treated and I wanted to get 
away from home and grow up a little bit and not have the comfort of being only 
45 minutes from home." 
</P>
<P>
Lodish said it wasn't easy to resist a personality such as Michigan Coach Bo 
Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him as a gut-tough, hard-nosed coach," Lodish said. "When I was 
being recruited, there were five high school All-Americans coming out of 
Michigan, and Michigan State got four of them. There was always the pressure on 
me that you're a Michigan boy and have to play here, that you're a 
Michigan-type person. 
</P>
<P>
"When Bo Schembechler came into your house, he demanded your attention. It was 
almost like it was his house, basically. He's kind of like a Woody Hayes-type 
coach. But I felt UCLA was the school for me." 
</P>
<P>
When Lodish eventually told Schembechler and his offensive coordinator, Gary 
Moeller, that he was going to UCLA, they asked him to delay his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"When I called Bo and told him I was going to UCLA, he went nuts a little bit," 
Lodish said. "He said, 'I'm coming to your house. You stay home.' So he and 
Gary Moeller came to my house. Who knows? Maybe I should have gone to Michigan. 
They were really on me to go to Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if UCLA Coach Terry Donahue is concerned about his Bruins 
having enough intensity this weekend against the Wolverines, he need not worry 
about Lodish, who has an agenda of his own. He has some bragging rights at home 
to attend to. 
</P>
<P>
And he wouldn't mind playing Michigan again this season . . . in the Rose Bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he could only take some satisfaction in Michigan's 22-14 Rose Bowl 
victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I was jumping for joy," he said. "Whenever anyone plays USC, I want USC to 
lose. It made me sick losing to USC because I came out here to play in the Rose 
Bowl game." 
</P>
<P>
Lodish said that he was mentioned on Schembechler's television show as a player 
who slipped away from Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what he thinks of me as a football player and that doesn't 
matter, but I'm sure he knows who I am," Lodish said, "and their offense is 
going to know who I am." 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA lineman recalls past recruiting days when Moeller and Schembechler 
tried to persuade him that he was going 3,000 miles away from home and wouldn't 
play because the California boys would be playing. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a challenge itself," Lodish said. "They were trying to beat 'Go Blue' 
into my head, but it really wasn't working. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt that UCLA would be a better school for me outside of football, 
getting contacts in business." 
</P>
<P>
Lodish said he became interested in UCLA when the Bruins beat the Wolverines, 
24-14, in the 1983 Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that hit by (defensive back) Don Rogers on (quarterback) Steve 
Smith in the Rose Bowl game. I thought this program is for real, that defense 
is for real." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lodish is emotionally ready for Saturday night's game, he is aware, of 
course, that Michigan is a formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to play our best to beat them," he said. "They're an 
excellent football team. They've got a tremendous attack and, being from 
Michigan, I know how Bo Schembechler is. They lost (last week) and Bo 
Schembechler doesn't like to lose, especially at home when he knows he could 
have won. They'll be pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, so will Lodish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UCLA Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said his team improved some in a 28-25 victory over 
San Diego State Saturday night, adding: "Obviously, we have a long, long way to 
go to become a good football team and improve. We have an opportunity to take a 
big step this week when we play Michigan. But you have to be blind to not 
realize what kind of football team they have." . . . Donahue also noted in a 
Michigan press release that Coach Bo Schembechler wants to improve his team's 
running game, which was shut down to some extent by Notre Dame. "I don't think 
you can win in football with passing alone," Schembechler said. "And no matter 
how well we pass the ball, that's not going to satisfy me until we will be able 
to punch holes in the defense and run." . . . Said Donahue: "I think he meant 
that for us. I take it personally." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin injury report: Nose tackle Jon Pryor (broken thumb), tailback Shawn Wills 
(sprained ankle), wide receiver Laurence Burkley (dislocated knee), defensive 
back Eric Nelson (torn knee ligaments) and tailback Ricky Davis (broken thumb). 
They're reportedly out of the Michigan game. "I don't think Wills will play, 
but he thinks he will and, if the player thinks so, he usually does," Donahue 
said. As for Pryor, a starter, Donahue says he may be out for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that quarterback Bret Johnson had a creditable game against San 
Diego State. "His greatest asset is that he is extremely competitive," Donahue 
said. "If every member of our team was as competitive, we would have a great 
team. He thrives on games." . . . UCLA is off to a shaky start, losing to 
Tennessee, 24-6, and coming from behind to beat San Diego State, a team that 
wasn't supposed to be in UCLA's class. Said Donahue: "Michigan is one of the 
top teams in the country. It's an opportunity for our team to step forward and 
show our colors." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler announced in Ann Arbor that freshman Elvis Grbac will be the 
Wolverines' starting quarterback this week. Senior starter Michael Taylor 
bruised his back last Saturday in Michigan's 24-19 loss to Notre Dame. Grbac 
replaced him in the third quarter and completed 17 of 21 passes for 134 yards 
and two touchdowns. . . . Fullback Jarrod Bunch also will miss the UCLA game 
after injuring a knee against Notre Dame. His replacement will be Leroy Hoard, 
who was the most valuable player last January in Michigan's 22-14 Rose Bowl 
victory over USC. Hoard, who ran for 142 yards and two touchdowns against USC, 
alternated at tailback last week with Tony Boles. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Dingman, a 6-2, 292-pound offensive guard, lost 30 pounds in the week 
before the Notre Dame game because of strep throat, Schembechler said, and is 
questionable for this week. . . . Gulam Khan, who had two kickoffs returned for 
touchdowns by Notre Dame's Raghib Ismail, broke an arm when hit by a blocker 
during Ismail's fourth-quarter runback.

<HEAD>NBC Wins Ratings and Top Two Places Go To Cosby and `Cheers'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied
for first in the Nielsen ratings for last week after playing second
string to football the previous week.
   None of the post-season bowl games were in the top 10 last week,
and several ranked near the bottom of the ratings. Football
dominated the ratings the previous week.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was third in a week that began to look like
normal again. CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote'' made it
back into the top 10. CBS' ``Designing Women,'' which had a
one-hour special episode with guest star Dolly Parton and featured
the birth of Charlene's baby, was No. 10.
   The highest ranked football game last week was NBC's coverage of
the Colorado-Notre Dame game in the Orange Bowl, which tied for
12th.
   NBC's coverage of the American Football League playoff between
Pittsburgh and Denver got a higher rating for its run over into
prime time on Sunday. The game, however, was not on the official
Nielsen list. NBC and CBS listed the run over as 12th and the
Orange Bowl as 13th, but the pro game was not listed by ABC.
   NBC handily won the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the week, and
CBS regained second place. The network averages: NBC 15.8, CBS
13.4, ABC 12.1. A ratings point represents the percentage of the
nation's 92.1 million television homes tuned to a show.
   Season to date, NBC leads with an average of 14.8 to ABC's 12.9
and CBS' 12.2.
   Here's the top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied;
ABC's ``Roseanne''; NBC's ``The Golden Girls''; CBS' ``60
Minutes''; NBC's ``A Different World''; CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote'';
NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ABC's ``Wonder Years'' tied; and CBS'
``Designing Women.''
   CBS' ``Murder in Black and White,'' the third movie with Richard
Crenna in the same role as a New York police detective, was 20th.
Its Sunday competition, the first part of the two-part NBC
miniseries ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story'' was in a three-way tie
for 34th.
   Two police shows debuted last week. ABC's ``Father Dowling
Mysteries'' was 46th and CBS' ``Max Monroe: Loose Cannon'' was 58th.
   Here's the standing for the other bowl games: ABC's Rose Bowl
tied for 28th, NBC's Fiesta Bowl 61st and ABC's Sugar Bowl 75th.
   CBS won first place among the evening news shows after a long
winning streak by ABC's ``World News Tonight.'' ABC trailed in
second place by a tenth of a point. ``The CBS Evening News'' was on
five days last week, while ABC and NBC did not have Monday shows on
New Years Day. The ratings: CBS 12.0, ABC 11.9, NBC 11.0.

FIESTA BOWL NEARLY WAS VOTED OUT OF BUSINESS

<P>
Winners and losers in this year's bowl sweeps: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
From New Year's Day giant to scapegoat. Organizers came very close to canceling 
the game because of the polarization caused by the defeated Martin Luthur King 
Jr. holiday referendum. They even considered a move to Jack Murphy Stadium in 
San Diego, but that was shot down by the NCAA. Just as well: It would have been 
a public relations and logistics catastrophe. Making matters worse, the Fiesta 
wanted Notre Dame; it got Louisville. A banner week, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
See Fiesta Bowl. The NAACP already has condemned California for accepting an 
invitation to play in the Tucson-based bowl. Not exactly the sort of publicity 
the Copper Bowl folks were hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
When Iowa and Illinois were beaten last Saturday, thus giving every team in the 
Big Ten at least two losses, the idea of inviting the conference runner-up 
became less appealing to the Sugar Bowl selection committee. Enter the 
Cavaliers, who solved all sorts of problems -- theirs and the Sugar Bowl's -- 
by accepting the bid to travel to New Orleans. Virginia, which previously had 
been considering the Fiesta Bowl, earns about $700,000 more by playing in the 
Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
The 25th-ranked Golden Eagles, previously destined for the Independence Bowl 
and a fun-filled stay in, uh, Shreveport, La., upgraded to the All-American 
Bowl. The payout -- $600,000 -- is the same, but Southern Mississippi gets ESPN 
instead of Mizlou and a Dec. 28 playing date rather than Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of purple bandwagons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers panicked and committed themselves to the Citrus Bowl long 
before they needed to. Turns out to be a great move, especially now that 
Georgia Tech, ranked No. 4, is the only undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels, ranked 15th, have a good team but little television appeal. Nor are 
they known for bringing lots of fans to bowls. Then again, Ole Miss has been to 
only four bowl games in the last 20 years. The Sugar Bowl is praying the Rebels 
don't win the Southeastern Conference title and receive the automatic bid to 
New Orleans. The Fiesta Bowl has its choice of the non-SEC winner and, given 
its druthers, would take Auburn, Alabama or Tennessee before inviting Ole Miss. 
Too bad. The Rebels are worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winners: Notre Dame, Colorado, Louisville and Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame and Colorado get a national championship rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville gets a $2.5-million Fiesta Bowl paycheck, compared to the $600,000 
payout it would have received from the All-American Bowl. The Cardinals' first 
bowl game since 1977 is a New Year's Day game. Their first television 
appearance since 1983 is on a major network. Of course, there might be a price 
to be paid for the decision to venture to Arizona. We'll see. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech gets a chance to win a national title if several things happen, 
including another regular-season loss by Notre Dame, followed by an Irish 
victory over Colorado in the Orange Bowl. Georgia Tech would then need to 
wallop Nebraska in the Citrus Bowl. Hey, a similar scenario worked for Miami 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC considered pulling its teams out of Fiesta Bowl contention -- but not 
for long. Two reasons: The decision to play was one for the university 
presidents to determine; and the SEC office saw nothing morally wrong with 
accepting a Fiesta Bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
"The general consensus of a lot of people in our conference is that it's 
preposterous to hold the Fiesta Bowl accountable for the actions of the 
voters," said Brad Davis, SEC assistant commissioner. "Those of us here in the 
South are used to the broad swath of indicting everyone for the actions of some 
people. You've got to cut through the grandstanding of the situation and really 
look at the facts. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, where do you stop?" Davis said. "Does an institution not play a bowl 
in California because (the state) might have a very liberal abortion law? Is 
the SEC office in Birmingham held accountable because the state capitol in 
Montgomery flies a rebel flag?" 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he expects the SEC to be criticized for participating in the Fiesta 
Bowl. "We're going to take some hits on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wave goodby to the NCAA rule requiring bowl selection committees to wait until 
Nov. 24 to extend official invitations. Dick Schultz, NCAA executive director, 
said he expects the deadline to be abolished at the organization's convention 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ridiculous rule," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowls can be penalized by the NCAA for ignoring the current rule, but it never 
happens. By never formally inviting a team until Nov. 24, the selection 
committees avoid punishment. 
</P>
<P>
If the NCAA has its way, the bowl people themselves will determine their own 
date, if any, for extending bids. And as usual, the bowl people, as they do now 
under the current format, will disregard the guidelines and arrange 
"unofficial" matchups. 
</P>
<P>
"The bowl association will try to come up with some sort of self-regulation 
that would hopefully attempt to keep some sense of order to the selection 
process, not that there's much now," said John Reid, executive director of the 
Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"The most likely to be injured are the schools that come on strongly at the end 
of the season." 
</P>
<P>
One other thing to remember about next season: As a safeguard of sorts, a team 
must beat at least six Division I-A opponents to be eligible for a bowl. That 
means the minute a team such as Notre Dame wins that sixth game, bowl scouts 
will be there with pens poised. 
</P>
<P>
For those clamoring for a Division I-A football playoff system, take heart. 
Schultz said one is on its way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just my own personal feeling, but I think that we'll have one before the 
decade is over," he said. "But I think it will be later in the decade, rather 
than earlier in the decade." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz said he envisioned a playoff that would, at first, include only two or 
four teams. 
</P>
<P>
When listing the nation's best running backs, don't forget to include Army's 
Mike Mayweather among the candidates. Colorado's Eric Bieniemy, Notre Dame's 
Raghib Ismail and Washington's Greg Lewis get most of the publicity, but 
Mayweather deserves mention, too. He rushed for 129 yards against Air Force 
last Saturday, which gives him eight 100-yard games this season and 21 in his 
career. . . . Virginia receiver Herman Moore isn't expected to return for his 
final year of eligibility. Moore, who has caught touchdown passes in an 
NCAA-record nine consecutive games, hasn't revealed his decision, but all 
indications point to first-round status in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) Notre Dame, (2) Colorado, (3) Georgia Tech, (4) BYU, (5) Miami, 
(6) Texas, (7) Florida, (8) Virginia, (9) Washington, (10) Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Our waiting list: Ohio State, Louisville, Penn State, Mississippi, Houston.

State are each 6-1 overall and trail Michigan (4-0) in the conference.;  
Nebraska tight end Johnny Mitchell has heightened the emotions in the game
between Nebraska and Colorado.;   "Colorado is just Kansas State or Kansas to

<LEADPARA>  A college football bowls alliance, designed to make a national championship

announced Wednesday.;    The alliance will include the Orange, Cotton, Sugar
and Fiesta bowls.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Also included are the Big East and Atlantic Coast conferences, which last
year added to their fold perennial national title contenders Miami and Florida
State, respectively. The Big Eight Conference will continue to send its
champion to the Orange Bowl. Southwest Conference-Cotton Bowl and Southeastern
Conference-Sugar Bowl affiliations also will continue.;    The agreement still
must be put into writing.;    Under the plan, scheduled to take effect in the
1992 season, the lineups for the four bowls would be decided by a prearranged
system.;    After the Big Eight, SWC and SEC champions are determined, the
other slots for the four bowl games would be filled by a five-team pool, which
would include Notre Dame, the champions of the Big East and ACC, and two other
highly ranked at-large teams. The at-large teams could be independents or
conference members.;    The highest-ranked team in the pool would go to the
bowl that offers the highest-ranked opponent.;    The coalition plans to wait
until after the final regular-season poll in early December to determine its
bowl pairings.;    The Fiesta Bowl -- which has no conference affiliation --
would play host to the national championship game if the five-team pool
includes the teams ranked No. 1 and No. 2.;    Notre Dame and the champions of
the ACC and Big East have the option of declining one bowl's invitation to
play in another bowl within the alliance.;    The deal doesn't ensure that the
two top-ranked teams will meet each Jan. 1. For example, the No. 1 team might
come from the Big Eight and the No. 2 team from the SEC, and under that
scenario, the alliance has no provision for putting the teams into the same
bowl.;    The Rose Bowl, which extends automatic berths to the Pacific 10 and
Big Ten champions, might also eclipse the new alliance's top matchup.;    Rose
Bowl officials held no discussions with the alliance.; PRO FOOTBALL: New
Orleans defensive lineman Frank Warren, who served a one-year drug suspension,
has been cleared to return to the league, Saints President Jim Finks said. . .
. Cornerback Dwayne Woodruff, 34, the last active member of a Pittsburgh Super
Bowl champion, retired.; PRO BASKETBALL: The Milwaukee Bucks signed center
Moses Malone, 36, to a two-year contract. Malone, an unrestricted free agent,
played for Atlanta last season.; MISCELLANY: The University of Arizona took
the recommendation of a hearing board and exonerated basketball player Khalid
Reeves concerning allegations that he sexually assaulted a female student. . .
. U.S. sprinter Michael Johnson ran the season's fastest 400 meters in 44.17
seconds in Lausanne, Switzerland. Merlene Ottey ran the fastest women's 100 in
the world this year with a 10.84 clocking. . . . In Santiago, Chile, Gabriel
Batistuta scored with nine minutes remaining to give Argentina a 1-0 victory
over Chile in the America Cup, the South American soccer championship. In the
day's first game, Paraguay beat Venezuela 5-0.  </TEXT>

   Saturday, Dec. 27, 10-11 p.m. ET, on ABC: "Diagnosis Malpractice." 
The ABC News "Closeup" unit specializes in state-of-the-art documentaries with a punch. 
This one is about two battling titans, the legal and the medical professions, locked in combat over skyrocketing malpractice litigation. 

   ---
   Sunday, Dec. 28, 9-10 p.m. ET, on WNYW in New York; various dates and times in other markets served by Orbis Communications (check local listings): "The Entrepreneurs, Program III, Expanding America." 
Underwritten by Wang Laboratories and hosted by Robert Mitchum, this series of six films pays handsome tribute to the persistence and originality of America's business pioneers. 
If you missed the first two, cheer up. 
They get more lively and contemporary as they go along. 

   ---
   Sunday, Dec. 28, 9-11 p.m. ET, on CBS: "The Return of Sherlock Holmes." 
The remarkable Holmes still receives over 1,500 letters a year, so perhaps it's not too far-fetched to imagine, with this TV movie, that he exists somewhere in a cryogenic slumber, just waiting to start sleuthing again. 
The accomplished British actor Michael Pennington stars in this . . . uh, revival. 

   ---
   Wednesday, Dec. 31, 11:30 p.m.-1 or 1:30 a.m., all three networks: New Year's Eve. 
Folks, 1987 was bound to come. 
Nothing to do except toast the cherub, swill champagne and channel-zap between Johnny Carson, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, the hot crowd at Times Square, Dick Clark, David Letterman, and the sizzling mob at L.A.'s Vertigo Club. 
I could tell you which is on which network, but that would spoil the fun. 

   ---
   Thursday, Jan. 1, from the hour you rise till the hour you drop, all three networks will be offering Football and Parades (all times ET). 
The Cotton Bowl Parade will kick off the big day in Dallas at 10 a.m. on CBS; the pre-Rose Bowl Tournament of Roses Parade marches through Pasadena, Calif., at 11 a.m. on NBC and CBS; the Citrus Bowl (Auburn vs. 
USC) starts at noon on ABC; the Cotton Bowl (Texas A&amp;M vs. 
Ohio State) begins at 1:30 p.m. on CBS; the Sugar Bowl (Nebraska vs. 
LSU) in New Orleans is on ABC at 3:30 p.m.; the Rose Bowl (Arizona State vs. 
Michigan) will be broadcast at 4:30 p.m. on NBC, followed on the same network by the Orange Bowl from Miami (Oklahoma vs. 
Arkansas) at 8 p.m. 

   ---
   Thursdays, Jan. 1-15, 9-10 p.m. ET, on PBS: "A Murder is Announced." 
Truly, here is a Miss Marple (Joan Hickson) who surpasses the amusing (but-untrue-to-the-Agatha-Christie- original) Margaret Rutherford. 
She appears rather late in the first episode, so wait patiently. 
She's worth it. 

   ---
   Friday, Jan. 2, 8-11 p.m. ET, on NBC: The game everyone is waiting for: The Fiesta Bowl. 
Miami (Florida) led by Heisman Trophy winner Vinny Testaverde faces Penn State in Tempe, Ariz., for the Division 1-A Championship. 

   ---
   Sunday, Jan. 4 and Tuesday, Jan. 6, 9-11 p.m. ET, on CBS: "At Mother's Request." 
Those who relished the twisted tale of Frances Schreuder, the heiress who manipulated her son into murdering her millionaire father, will also relish the fact that both CBS and NBC have made miniseries about the crime. 
First to air is this whodunit version starring Stefanie Powers; it focuses on crime-solving more than on character-delving, but it's riveting nonetheless. 

   ---
   Monday, Jan. 5, 10-11 p.m. ET, on NBC: "To Be A Teacher." 
Sponsored solely by IBM, this NBC White Paper will sober you up really quickly on the subject of what it's like to be in charge of a public-school classroom nowadays. 

   ---
   Wednesday, Jan. 7, 10-11 p.m. ET, on PBS: "Back at the Ranch." 
Cattle are more tractable than students, but it's no picnic being a rancher, either. 
This production of Nebraska public TV is a bit on the slow side, but it's also fair, interesting and informative.

So many bowls, so few great teams. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Not one undefeated and untied team will play in a bowl this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only Brigham Young, among the bowl candidates, can win 11 regular-season 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only seven others have a legitimate chance at 10 victories, and one of 
those teams, Notre Dame, has to play Tennessee, Penn State and USC. Colorado 
can win 10, but it will have played 12 games and also benefited from the 
infamous fifth-down victory over Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only eight are likely to win nine games, and that might be a generous 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only seven will probably manage eight victories and only seven are likely 
to win seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If projections hold true, nine other bowl candidates will have only six 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
There are 19 bowls and, at the moment, about 40 teams available to fill those 
38 openings. Invitations are supposed to be presented on Nov. 24, but nobody 
has ever accused bowl officials of paying attention to their calendars. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting our best guesses . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Big Five: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Orange Bowl. Colorado vs. Notre Dame or Miami, but the Hurricanes will be 
invited only if Notre Dame loses to Tennessee Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sugar Bowl. Southeastern Conference champion (probably Tennessee) vs. 
Michigan, Notre Dame or Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cotton Bowl. Southwest Conference champion (probably Texas, since 
undefeated and untied Houston is ineligible) vs. Miami, Notre Dame or Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fiesta Bowl. Virginia vs. Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rose Bowl. Washington vs. Big Ten champion (probably Iowa). 
</P>
<P>
The Medium Six: Citrus -- Georgia Tech vs. Nebraska; Gator -- Auburn vs. Ohio 
State; Holiday -- Western Athletic Conference champion (probably Brigham Young) 
vs. Texas A&amp;M; Hall of Fame -- Clemson vs. Illinois; Liberty -- Army vs. 
Minnesota or Indiana; Blockbuster -- Florida State vs. Ohio State or 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
The Rest: Copper -- Wyoming vs. California; John Hancock -- Michigan State vs. 
USC; Freedom -- Colorado State vs. Oregon; Peach -- North Carolina State or 
Mississippi vs. Indiana or Minnesota; All-American -- Louisville vs. Alabama; 
Aloha -- Syracuse vs. Arizona; California -- San Jose State or Fresno State vs. 
Central Michigan; Independence -- Baylor vs. LSU or Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Teams on the bubble: Texas Christian and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Notre Dame is the center of attention. A victory over Tennessee will 
allow the Irish to delay a commitment and help the Sugar Bowl's chances of 
landing Notre Dame. An Auburn or Mississippi vs. Notre Dame game remains a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
If Houston finishes the season undefeated and untied, Cougar fans are calling 
for Associated Press voters to crown the team as national champion. Four 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does a team on NCAA probation deserve to be eligible for a national title? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should a team be voted No. 1 without playing a bowl game? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should a team whose schedule includes Eastern Washington, Nevada Las Vegas, 
Southern Methodist, Rice, Texas Tech, Arizona State, Arkansas -- who have a 
combined record of 21-40 and only one of these seven, Eastern Washington (5-4), 
has a winning record -- be seriously considered as national championship 
material? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Would the best team in the country allow Texas Christian's second-string 
quarterback to throw for an NCAA-record 690 yards against it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A No. 1 vote for Houston, undefeated and untied or not, is a vote 
wasted. 
</P>
<P>
One more Houston item: We don't have a Heisman Trophy ballot, but if we did, we 
wouldn't penalize Houston quarterback David Klingler for directing a 
run-and-shoot offense that produces outrageous point and yardage totals. 
</P>
<P>
To do so would be the same as penalizing quarterback Ty Detmer for BYU's 
intricate passing attack, or Darian Hagan and Eric Bieniemy for Colorado's 
option offense, or Raghib Ismail for Notre Dame's plan to get him the ball -- 
by pass, handoff or special teams -- at least 20 times a game. Offensive 
systems and philosophies are nice, but without the right players, they flop. 
</P>
<P>
We also wouldn't dismiss Klingler as a leading candidate simply because former 
Cougar Andre Ware won the Heisman last year. One doesn't average more than four 
touchdown passes and 443 yards a game, as Klingler has this season, by 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
And for those critics who say the run-and-shoot is designed for short gains, 
think again. Of Klingler's seven touchdown pass plays last week against TCU, 
six of them traveled 35 yards or more -- 36, 42, 46, 59, 80 and 88. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler should consider himself lucky. Heisman candidate Shawn Moore, 
Virginia's multitalented quarterback, was scheduled to appear on NBC's "Today 
Show" last Monday. But after the Cavaliers were upset by Georgia Tech, the 
network called Sunday and canceled the request. Never mind that Moore accounted 
for four Virginia touchdowns in the loss. Instead, Ismail and Klingler were 
interviewed. All in all, a classless move by NBC to omit Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing against the Virginia sports information department, but it pushed the 
wrong Moore for the Heisman. Herman, not Shawn, is the best Cavalier player 
and, according to Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross, the best wide receiver in the 
country. He caught nine passes for 234 yards and one touchdown Saturday. Moore 
has at least one touchdown reception in his last 10 games and 15 of his last 
16. 
</P>
<P>
And for what it's worth, Kentucky Coach Bill Curry, whose son plays for 
Virginia, said that Cavalier Coach George Welsh had no choice but to kick a 
tying field goal against Georgia Tech with 2:34 remaining. The alternative: a 
fourth-and-goal situation at the Yellow Jacket six-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have done the same thing," said Curry, who attended the game. Of 
course, Georgia Tech got the ball back, drove down the field and kicked a 
game-winning field goal. As for Curry, he couldn't have been too upset. After 
all, he's a Georgia Tech graduate and a former Georgia Tech head coach. 
</P>
<P>
How tough was it to get a ticket to last Saturday's game at Charlottesville, 
Va.? Well, as part of Virginia's annual basketball scrimmage, musician Bruce 
Hornsby and actor Woody Harrelson of "Cheers" fame agreed to serve as honorary 
coaches. Hornsby, who received no cash appearance fee, later said that one of 
the reasons he accepted the coaching invitation was the promise of a 
Virginia-Georgia Tech football ticket. He got one. . . . Alabama isn't going to 
win the SEC, but it might win six games, which is an accomplishment considering 
that the Crimson Tide lost their first three this season. The Tide hasn't 
allowed a touchdown in 12 quarters. . . . Louisville is ranked in the AP poll 
for the first time in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
After 21 years as a college coach, Notre Dame's Lou Holtz will take his No. 
1-ranked team to Knoxville, Tenn., and 91,110-seat Neyland Stadium for the 
first time Saturday. Already, Holtz has called several colleagues, including 
former Alabama coach Ray Perkins, and asked how to deal with the deafening 
crowd noise. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I'll call until I find someone who has something nice to say about 
it," Holtz said. "Everybody says don't go unless you absolutely have to." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz already has instructed team managers to play the song, "Rocky Top," a 
Tennessee band favorite, during each of the Notre Dame practices this week. For 
two hours, the song is played again and again. Notre Dame players leave the 
workouts humming the tune. "I went to sleep last night and I could hear it," 
cornerback Todd Lyght said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Holtz of Notre Dame's No. 1 ranking: "I have never worried about No. 1. We 
have a chance to be No. 1. But there are 10-15 teams who have a better chance 
to be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Grace Tower is the tallest dormitory on the campus at South Bend, Ind. Whenever 
the Irish are first in the polls, a No. 1 sign is placed atop the building. 
Holtz suggested that the person in charge of hanging the sign might want to 
keep his tools handy. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy's upset," Holtz said. "He knows he might have to go up there in bad 
weather and take it down." 
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) Notre Dame, (2) Colorado, (3) Washington, (4) Houston, (5) BYU, 
(6) Miami, (7) Iowa, (8) Tennessee, (9) Texas, (10) Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Our waiting list: Florida, Nebraska, Mississippi, Florida State and Virginia.

KTLA GARNERS MOST VIEWERS FOR COVERAGE OF ROSE PARADE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While the usual mob of early-rising revelers lined the streets of Pasadena, the 
101st Tournament of Roses Parade was also being watched on television in more 
than 2 million Southern California homes. 
</P>
<P>
Between 8 and 10:30 a.m., 83% of all the TV sets that were in use in the Los 
Angeles market were tuned to one of the five stations that aired this year's 
assortment of floats, flowers, celebrities and marching bands. 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, KTLA Channel 5, with its team of Bob Eubanks and Stephanie 
Edwards and its promise of never leaving the parade for commercials, grabbed 
the bulk of the viewing audience. KTLA had 1.1 million households -- more than 
the other four stations combined. 
</P>
<P>
KTTV Channel 11 was a distant second with about 419,000 homes. The three 
network-owned stations, which broadcast the parade with repeated commercial 
breaks to the entire nation, were far behind in the local race. KCBS Channel 2 
attracted about 192,000 homes, while KNBC Channel 4 and KABC Channel 7 drew 
about 143,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
On the football front, with USC shooting for its first bowl win in five years, 
the Rose Bowl on KABC was far and away the most watched game of the day in Los 
Angeles. The Trojans' 17-10 victory over the University of Michigan garnered a 
23.1 local rating, meaning it was seen in more than 1.1 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
Other New Year's Day local Bowl ratings (with each point representing 49,315 
homes): 
</P>
<P>
* Orange Bowl: Notre Dame vs. Colorado, KNBC: 18.3. 
</P>
<P>
* Sugar Bowl: Miami vs. Alabama, KABC: 8.9. 
</P>
<P>
* Hall of Fame: Auburn vs. Ohio St., KNBC: 8. 
</P>
<P>
* Cotton Bowl: Tennessee vs. Arkansas, KCBS: 6. 
</P>
<P>
* Fiesta Bowl: Florida St. vs. Nebraska, KNBC: 4.5.

   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied
for first place in the ratings in a holiday week in which none of
the post-season football bowl games made the Nielsen Top 10.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was third and CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and
``Murder, She Wrote'' were back near the top as the ratings began
to return to normal.
   Football dominated the ratings during the previous week. This
ratings period the top-ranked game was NBC's coverage of Colorado
and Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl. It tied for 12th place.
   The spill over into prime time of NBC's coverage of the AFL
professional playoff between Pittsburgh and Denver got a higher
rating, but was not included on the official Nielsen list. NBC and
CBS put it in 12th place in their version of the list and the
Orange Bowl tied for 13th. ABC did not count the pro game in its
list.
   CBS' ``Designing Women,'' which had a one-hour special episode
with guest star Dolly Parton and the birth of Charlene's baby, was
No. 10.
   NBC won the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the week ended Jan. 7
by a wide margin and CBS took over second place again from ABC. The
network averages: NBC 15.8, CBS 13.4, ABC 12.1. A ratings point
represents the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television
homes tuned to a show.
   For the season to date, NBC leads with an average of 14.8. ABC
is second with 12.9 and CBS is third with 12.2.
   Here's the Top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied,
ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls,'' CBS' ``60
Minutes,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,''
NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ABC's ``Wonder Years'' tied, CBS'
``Designing Women.''
   CBS' ``Murder in Black and White,'' the third movie with Richard
Crenna in the same role as a New York police detective, was 20th.
Its Sunday competition, the NBC miniseries ``Drug Wars: The
Camarena Story'' did not do nearly as well. The opening episode of
the three-part show was in a three-way tie for 34th.
   Two new series had premieres last week. ABC's ``Father Dowling
Mysteries'' was 46th and CBS' ``Max Monroe: Loose Cannon'' was 58th.
   Here's how the other bowl games fared: ABC's Rose Bowl tied for
28th, NBC's Fiesta Bowl 61st and ABC's Sugar Bowl 75th.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married ... With Children'' tied for
43rd place.
   CBS took first place among the evening news shows away from ABC
for the week. ABC fell to second place by a tenth of a point. ``The
CBS Evening News'' was on five days last week, while ABC and NBC
did not have Monday shows. The ratings: CBS 12.0, ABC 11.9, NBC
11.0.
   The lowest-rated show was ABC's ``Mission: Impossible.'' Here
are the five bottom network shows: ABC's ``Saturday Night With
Connie Chung,'' ABC's ``Life Goes On,'' CBS' ``Tour of Duty,''
ABC's Sugar Bowl, ABC's ``Mission: Impossible.''

VIRGINIA HAS SCHEDULE OF A CHAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Of the remaining undefeated teams with a chance at the national championship 
(sorry Fresno State), it appears that Virginia has the easiest path to an 11-0 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are no sure thing, but compared to unbeaten Notre Dame, Florida 
State, Nebraska, Tennessee and Auburn, they have the most accommodating 
schedule. Incidentally, Houston, Oklahoma and Florida are not included in this 
list of undefeated teams because they aren't eligible to compete in bowls this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Now then, consider each team's most difficult remaining opponents: 
</P>
<P>
NOTRE DAME -- Miami, Pittsburgh, Tennessee, Penn State and USC. Three of the 
five games are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
FLORIDA STATE -- Miami, Auburn, Louisiana State and Florida. The Miami and 
Auburn games are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
NEBRASKA -- The Cornhuskers still have to play Oklahoma at Norman, Okla., and 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
TENNESSEE -- Florida, Alabama and Notre Dame. All three games are at home, but 
the Gators are tough; Alabama is Tennessee's fiercest rival, and Notre Dame is 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
AUBURN -- Florida State, Florida, Georgia and Alabama. If the Tigers can get 
past Florida State, they still have the Gators, at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
VIRGINIA -- North Carolina State, Georgia Tech and Maryland. Not exactly 
murderer's row, is it? All three are home games, which doesn't make them 
gimmes, but . . . Fast-improving Georgia Tech could be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's rise to No. 4 in the Associated Press poll is important to the 
Cavaliers for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It's the highest football ranking in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could change the entire bowl picture. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
When the Atlantic Coast Conference, of which Virginia is a member, signed a 
four-year contract with the Florida Citrus Bowl in the summer of 1988, a 
stipulation was included in the agreement. It read that in the first and third 
years of the contract, the ACC champion was committed to the Citrus Bowl and 
vice versa. In the second and fourth years, the Citrus Bowl has the option of 
inviting the ACC champion or another team. This is year No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
But -- and this is where it gets interesting -- a national championship 
contingency exists. The Citrus Bowl can opt out of the agreement if it can 
match the No. 1-ranked team against No. 2, 3 or 4. Likewise, the ACC champion 
-- and let's say it's Virginia -- can opt out of the deal if its ranked no 
lower than fourth and can play the No. 1 team for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
One catch: The ACC champion can leave the Citrus only for the Sugar Bowl, 
Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl. That's because the Citrus has no chance at the 
Southeastern Conference, Southwest Conference or Big Eight champions, all of 
which are tied to the aforementioned three bowls. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl is off-limits because the Citrus considers it direct 
competition. The Fiesta has no conference tie-ins. 
</P>
<P>
"If all the bowls would have a similar agreement, we'd have a national 
championship game every year," said Chuck Rohe, executive director of the 
Citrus Bowl.

Not so fast. The Citrus Bowl will pay a projected $1.35 million to $1.5 million 
to its teams this year, which is considerably less than what a school could 
expect to earn by playing in, say, the Sugar Bowl, Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl. 
According to Rohe, if the Citrus has a chance at keeping Virginia for a 
national title contest, they would ask ABC, which is broadcasting the New 
Year's Day game, to increase the rights fee. ABC isn't under any obligation to 
do so, but you can bet it would if a championship game -- and championship 
ratings -- were available. 
</P>
<P>
No one really expected Florida to be able to strike a deal with the NCAA's 
Committee on Infractions, did they? The Gators basically wanted to devise their 
own punishment for past rules violations. Fat chance. 
</P>
<P>
Recent NCAA sanctions against Florida, 4-0 this season, prohibit a bowl 
appearance after the 1990 season. Outraged Gator officials wanted to trade 12 
football scholarships for the chance to accept a bowl bid and bowl money. The 
committee heard Florida's appeal last weekend, but wasn't swayed. "(A 
university) can ask the Committee on Infractions whatever it wants to," the 
NCAA's David Berst said. 
</P>
<P>
Berst agreed the request was unusual. Not since 1952 has the NCAA removed an 
announced penalty. 
</P>
<P>
There is one solution to Florida's problem: Don't cheat. 
</P>
<P>
How seriously do they take their football at Alabama? When the Crimson Tide 
lost its first three games of the season, radio disc jockeys in Birmingham, 
Ala., and Tuscaloosa, Ala., began giving air time to "Dig Him Up," an awful 
ballad about retrieving the legendary Bear Bryant from his coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, especially new and beleaguered Alabama Coach Gene Stallings, deserves 
that sort of misguided abuse. 
</P>
<P>
And those sightings of Danny Ford at Alabama can be disregarded. Stallings is 
safe. Ford, a former Crimson Tide player who was forced out as Clemson's coach, 
is a welcome visitor, said Alabama Athletic Director Hootie Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
The coach who should be worrying is Mississippi State's Rocky Felker. Ford has 
been mentioned as a possible replacement for that struggling program. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dye's decision to play for a tie against Tennessee continues to receive 
mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Constitution columnist Steve Hummer listed a few of Dye's favorite 
things. Favorite food: Thai. Favorite storm: typhoon. Favorite cowboy lyric: 
"Yippie Tie Yie Yay." Favorite player: Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors agreed with the Auburn coach's move. 
And for what it's worth, so did Virginia's George Welsh. 
</P>
<P>
After Virginia Tech nearly upset No. 2-ranked Florida State at Tallahassee, 
Fla., Hokie quarterback Will Furrer asked a Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter: 
"Did we earn enough respect to get in the ACC?" Virginia Tech, which gained 411 
yards against the Seminoles, desperately wants an ACC invitation. It shouldn't 
hold its breath. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech isn't the only school that wants to jump on the ACC bandwagon. 
The Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl and newly approved Sunshine Bowl are all talking 
to the conference about an agreement once the Citrus Bowl deal ends after the 
1992 game. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Citrus Bowl is pushing for an extension. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to published reports, the Orange Bowl will not automatically follow 
Miami to whatever conference it might eventually join. "There's no commitment 
like that," said Bob Roller, Orange Bowl communications director. "They're not 
trailing Miami." 
</P>
<P>
It can't, mainly because the bowl's contract with the Big Eight runs through 
Jan. 1, 1995. The only way the agreement is voided is if any team leaves the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>

A RICH TRADITION; COLORADO VS. STANFORD STANFORD STADIUM 12:30 P.M. SATURDAY;
Stanford football dates back to 1891, when the school played its first game
against Hopkins Academy. The first Big Game against Cal came the next year,
when Stanford prevailed 14-10. In the ensuing years, there have been 53
All-America players, 15 bowl games, including 11 Rose Bowl appearances, and
one Heisman Trophy. The school's football team has been led by such legendary
coaches as Pop Warner, Walter Camp and Bill Walsh and its games have included
such big upsets as last year's shocker over Notre Dame and wild finishes as
the five-lateral defeat against Cal in 1982. (color); PHOTO: Albert; PHOTO:

<TEXT>  Heisenberg when asked about; Stanford University.; When Stanford University
fielded its first football team in 1891, football on the West Coast was still
in its infancy.;   The spirit of college football is said to have started in
the West, but the game being played was very different from the eastern
version, both in rules and caliber. The game played out West was described as
a crude form of rugby.;   The transition that followed is considered the birth
of U.S. football on the West Coast. If so, then Stanford, boasting some of the
most famous and innovative names in college football, may be considered its
home.;   Today, after 53 All-America players, 15 bowl games, including 11 Rose
Bowl appearances, one Heisman Trophy award winner, and participant in one of
college football's greatest rivalries, Stanford is celebrating its 100th
football anniversary.;   During that time, Stanford has a compiled a record of
552-337-51. Stanford did not play football from 1943 to 1945 because of World
War II.;   Currently, there are 12 Cardinal players on NFL rosters. The list
includes Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway, Buffalo Bills wide receiver
James Lofton, and Chicago Bears running back Brad Muster.;   "We try to make
people aware, particularly the players, of the pride that goes along with
wearing the Stanford uniform," said Denny Green, in his third year as coach of
the Cardinal. "Right now we have possession of the Legends Trophy, which
started in 1925 for the first time Stanford and Notre Dame met.;   "Pop Warner
was coaching for Stanford and Knute Rockne was coaching for Notre Dame. I
don't think you could have any two more legendary coaches meet on the football
field.";   Some of the most innovative minds of the game coached at Stanford,
including Walter Camp, Warner, Clark Shaughnessy, Chuck Taylor and Bill
Walsh.;   Camp, known as the "Father of American Football" and the first coach
at Stanford in 1892, helped change the style of the game from rugby to
football.;   As a member of the Intercollegiate Rules Committee, Camp created
the line of scrimmage, 11-man team, signal calling, and the quarterback
position.;   He compiled a 12-3-3 record at Stanford before returning to coach
his alma mater, Yale.;   Warner, who coached at Stanford from 1924 to 1932 and
compiled a 81-17 record, was credited by football historians with numerous
inventions, including the single- and double-wing offensive attacks, the
reverse play, huddles between plays and headgear.;    Also, two Cardinal
coaches were named the national coach of the year. Shaughnessy, whose Vow
Boys, led by All-America quarterback Frankie Albert, confused opposing
defenses with his T-formation and man-in-motion schemes, received the honor in
1940.;   Taylor, the only man in college football history to go to the Rose
Bowl as a player (1941), coach (1952) and athletic director (1971-72), all at
the same school, was selected in 1951.;   Stanford, which changed its nickname
to Cardinal from the Indians in 1972, has also had several legendary games.
Some jubilant wins, some narrow defeats.;   Among the great victories are
back-to-Rose Bowl upsets over Ohio State (27-17) and Michigan (13-12) in 1971
and 1972. In 1970, Jim Plunkett was awarded the Heisman Trophy, the only one
in the school's history.;   In the 1974 and 1990 Big Games with Cal, were both
won by the Cardinal (22-20 and 27-25) on last-play field goals by Mike
Langford and John Hopkins, respectively.;   Then, there was last year's 36-31
upset win over Notre Dame.;   "That was one of the great wins in Stanford
history," said Green. "Playing at home and ranked No. 1, they had not lost in
a situation like that since 1954.";   Ironically, some of Stanford's most
bitter losses have been to Cal.;   Stanford suffered close losses in the 1958
(16-15) and 1959 (20-17) Big Games. In the 1959 game, Cardinal quarterback
Dick Norman had an incredible performance, completing 34 of 39 passes for 401
yards.;   "He (Norman) put on one of hell of an offensive display," said Chris
Burford, a Stanford All-American from 1957-59, who played in both games. "We
lost both games, but they were probably two of the greatest games we played
against each other.";   The most memorable, however, was the 1982 Big Game
which featured one of the wildest finishes in college football history.;   Cal
defeated Stanford 25-20 on a game ending 57-yard kickoff return seemingly
stolen from a rugby playbook.;   It featured five laterals, started by Cal's
Kevin Moen and eventually ended with Moen taking it over the goal-line as the
Stanford band ran interference.; Magic moments; Here are some highlights in
Stanford football history.; (box)First team in 1891 went 3-1 without a coach.;
(box)The first game against Cal in 1892 ended in a 14-10 victory.;

THE BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE PARADE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW YEAR'S: ORGANIZERS AND PROMOTERS HAVE SEVERAL THEORIES TO EXPLAIN LOWER 
ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS YEAR'S PROCESSION AND FOOTBALL GAME.

With only four days to go before Pasadena's 101st Tournament of Roses Parade, 
officials say thousands of parade tickets remain unsold and that tickets to the 
Rose Bowl game have not gone as quickly as in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
Held back by earthquake jitters, bored over a second USC-Michigan match-up and 
sated by last year's 100th anniversary blow-out, many fans have been slow this 
year to flock to Southern California's premier New Year's Day procession and 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
A few thousand unsold seats line the 5 1/2-mile parade route, said Sindee 
Anderson, general manager of Sharp Seating Co., which puts up 100,000 
grandstand seats. 
</P>
<P>
In a normal year, only a handful would remain by this point, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The head of a tour company that takes senior citizens to the parade and the 
Rose Bowl game estimated that the number of his visitors is down by half this 
year. "One group from Florida that usually brings 250 interested only 35 this 
year," said Bud Johnsen of Special Events Services. "Instead of three bus loads 
from Amarillo, Tex., I've got a bus and a half." 
</P>
<P>
Even Pasadena Mayor William Thomson found an unresponsive market for the 100 
Rose Bowl tickets that he distributed at face value, $42 apiece, for the 
USC-Michigan match up. "Up until (University of Michigan Coach) Bo Schembechler 
announced his retirement, there was not much of a demand for tickets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With hundreds of thousands of people expected to line the parade route and more 
than 100,000 expected to jam themselves into the Rose Bowl, it's not as if no 
one is coming to Pasadena's party. But city and parade officials, as well as 
those who make their livings from the parade, are used to a higher level of 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
They have different theories about why there isn't more excitement this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the earthquake," Anderson said. The 7.1-magnitude temblor in 
Northern California on Oct. 17 caused widespread damage and spawned tabloid 
predictions that California will fall into the ocean by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
East Coast customers have mentioned those accounts when they canceled tickets, 
Anderson said. "Most of us Californians are not worried about the shaking," she 
said. "I know one tour operator who is telling them, 'You have to love 
California with all its faults.' " 
</P>
<P>
Johnsen believes that the parade's 100th anniversary celebration in 1989 
undercut enthusiasm for the 1990 parade. "The Tournament of Roses Assn. 
oversold the 100th anniversary," he said. "If you were coming from out of 
state, you went last year. It's easing down a little this year." 
</P>
<P>
But Jay Brooks of Al Brooks Rose Bowl Tours believes that domestic travel is 
down in general and the lagging Rose Parade business simply reflects an 
industrywide trend. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the idea that the same two college teams are playing for the second 
year in a row at the Rose Bowl has not helped. "People said, 'Oh gee, Michigan 
and USC again, what's new?' " Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
But after Schembechler, the 21-year Michigan coach and veteran of eight 
previous Rose Bowls, announced his retirement in mid-December, demand did heat 
up for game tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Most people trying to buy game tickets will now have to pay between $75 and 
$250 to ticket agencies, which buy their tickets from the public and the 
colleges. The $42 face-value tickets have all been accounted for, according to 
Jack French, executive director of the Tournament of Roses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tournament's ticket distribution system with the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn., the PAC 10 schools receive 52,000 tickets, the Big 10 gets 
23,000 and the tournament association receives 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Of the tournament tickets, about 10,000 are allocated to the 1,400 tournament 
association members, whose entitlements are based on seniority. Another 7,000 
tickets are purchased by float sponsors, 3,500 are set aside for a lottery for 
the general public, 1,200 are sold to the city of Pasadena and the rest are 
used for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
City employees receive about 400 of the city tickets. The employees are 
selected to buy $42 tickets by department heads in drawings or by other methods 
devised by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"We use them basically to do P.R. for the city and promote the name of the 
city," said Ed Aghjayan, assistant city manager of Pasadena. For example, 
tickets are sold at face value to members of Congress, mayors and school 
officials throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Board of Directors, the city's seven-member council that 
includes the mayor, also receive 100 tickets each. The directors sell their $42 
tickets to campaign supporters, family members, neighborhood organizations and 
residents within their districts. 
</P>
<P>
The board's ticket giveaway was criticized in 1987, when the Super Bowl was 
played at the Rose Bowl. After allegations of cronyism and favoritism were 
leveled against them, directors passed rules tightening ticket distribution. A 
list of people receiving tickets must be kept, and recipients must pledge not 
to resell them -- a pledge board members say is nearly impossible to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
Among those receiving tickets at face value this year is Billy Hinsdale, a 
14-year-old newspaper carrier from Saratoga, Calif. Billy wrote the city's 
mayor in November, saying he would save money from his newspaper route to buy 
tickets for his mother, father and sister Kathryn. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a good person for most of my life," Billy wrote. "I get good grades 
and stay out of trouble."

IT'S MORE THAN A CONSOLATION GAME; 
</P>
<P>
FREEDOM BOWL: OREGON AND COLORADO STATE, UNLIKE PARTICIPANTS IN PAST YEARS, ARE 
GLAD TO BE IN ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After several years of serving a bowl of holiday leftovers, this year the 
Freedom Bowl offers something different. So what if Oregon and Colorado State 
aren't haute cuisine? At least these teams aren't the warmed-over remnants of 
seasons gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
No more teams such as Florida, which sold only 1,200 tickets before slogging 
through the final comedown of a disappointing season in last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Oregon and Colorado State are happy to be here, as both coaches and any 
third-string free safety seemed pleased to say this week, prompted or not. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon is making its bid for respectability by playing in consecutive bowl 
games for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from the University of Oregon, it feels like back-to-back Super Bowls," 
said Michael McClellan, a senior flanker. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks have built their 8-3 record on the arm of Bill Musgrave, who was the 
All-Pacific 10 quarterback, despite the attention devoted to others. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State is positively giddy over its first bowl game in 42 years, 
getting a sequel, at long last, to its 1949 Raisin Bowl appearance. It has 
taken only two years for Earle Bruce, the former Ohio State coach, to bring the 
Rams from 1-10 to 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Is this game a comedown for a man who took the Buckeyes to two Rose Bowl games? 
Bruce, his ability proved once again, just smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've also been in the Peach, the Liberty, the Hall of Fame, the Fiesta," Bruce 
said. "I've been to the Citrus Bowl and the Tangerine. I can't say I haven't 
had all the experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't feel any different. I think it's different for the kids. I've never 
coached a more appreciative football team than this. Sometimes in other 
programs, they don't appreciate it. They have been so receptive and worked so 
hard. We're not the most talented football team, but we have some talent." 
</P>
<P>
All this good feeling came by design, not happenstance, said Don Andersen, the 
game's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was important to have teams here that were anxious to be here," 
Andersen said, calling it "the game plan" to get teams from the Pac-10 and the 
Western Athletic Conference. "We didn't even go to the Big Ten, the SEC, Notre 
Dame. We took a very practical approach." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon is favored in this match, billed as a battle between the Ducks' passing 
offense, in which Musgrave has averaged 222 yards a game, and Colorado State's 
multiple-formation ground game. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks is encouraged that his offense will be stronger than 
it was in the final two games, when an injury-depleted unit failed to score a 
touchdown while losing to California, 28-3, and defeating Oregon State, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave has had time to recover from several injuries, the most recent of 
which kept him out of the last six quarters of the regular season with a bruise 
in his throwing shoulder. Two receivers are back after undergoing arthroscopic 
knee surgery, McClellan and Joe Reitzug. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, tailback Sean Burwell, a redshirt freshman who led the team with 949 
yards rushing after being forced into action because of an early-season injury 
to the starter, is back after missing most of the Oregon State game because of 
a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all healthy," Brooks said. "It makes me feel a little better about our 
chances on the offensive side since we struggled so much in the last two games 
of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks are not as sound on defense, where they lost senior Peter Brantley, 
an all-conference outside linebacker, because of a strained left knee suffered 
in practice last week in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State also has had time for an important player to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Alford, a tailback who ran for 1,035 yards last season, has been bothered 
by a right hamstring pull and later by a strained tendon in his right foot. He 
rushed for 647 yards, but started only one game. The bulk of the ground work 
went to Brian Copeland and Todd Yert, a short-yardage fullback who has put his 
head down and bulled to 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Alford, there's a guy who hasn't been well all year," Bruce said. "He's going 
to see the football quite a bit -- if we get the football quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce keeps his own counsel as to which of two rotating quarterbacks he will 
start -- Mike Gimenez, the better option quarterback and the starter in the 
past five games, or Kevin Verdugo, the better passer, who was slowed by a 
shoulder injury late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Known to surprise even his assistants with his choice of a starter, Bruce 
strayed from an earlier expectation that Gimenez would start and said Friday, 
"I think probably (it would be) Verdugo, if we had to start right now." 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Colorado State lost a starter in the secondary this week when 
Harlan Carroll came down with what was diagnosed as mononucleosis. That will 
put added pressure on a defensive backfield secondary already facing a great 
deal of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Musgrave throws the ball, and if you overdo (setting the defense for) that, 
they'll run the ball and put it in the end zone," Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon must be watchful of the curse of the favorite: overconfidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obviously concerned that could be the case with our team," Brooks said. 
"There's no question Colorado State is challenged. Earle Bruce is challenged 
when he gets up in the morning. There's no question they'll be ready to play 
and come out and bloody our noses." 
</P>
<P>
Freedom Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
The kickoff is at 5 p.m. for the game, which will be on Channel 9 and the 
Raycom Sports Network. The game was televised by NBC last year. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon had sold 18,000 tickets as of Friday, and Colorado State had made 8,000 
of a total of 11,800 guaranteed sales by the Western Athletic Conference. An 
additional 10,000 tickets were sold by the Orange County Sports Assn., and 
another 10,000 have been given away for distribution to military families. 
About 3,000 in walkup sales are expected. The record for ticket sales is 
56,910, set in 1986 for the UCLA-Brigham Young game.

Colorado State Coach Earle Bruce was asked for his reaction to Air Force's 
upset of Ohio State, his former employer. Bruce beamed good-naturedly. "That's 
a good question. I've been waiting for that one. . . . Great coaching job by 
(Air Force Coach) Fisher DeBerry. That was a great win for us as a conference, 
a prestige win that shows the WAC is coming of age."

Troy Aikman was at the crossroads at Texas Stadium Monday, ending a fine 
collegiate career with the kind of passing that made his reputation at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
And, if he is the Dallas Cowboys' No. 1 pick in next April's National Football 
League draft as expected, the quarterback gave hopeful Dallas fans some 
optimisim. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman's third-down efficiency confused Arkansas on two long touchdown drives 
as the ninth-ranked Bruins set an National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record 
with their seventh consecutive bowl victory, beating the Razorbacks, 17-3, in 
the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 12 of 20 third-down opportunities and threw a touchdown pass 
as the Bruins again showed their domination in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) broke a tie with Georgia Tech, Nebraska, USC and Alabama in 
claiming a spot in the record books with a seventh bowl victory. The Bruins' 
victory streak includes three Rose Bowls, a Fiesta, an Aloha and a Freedom 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman overcame an early interception to direct the Bruins on touchdown drives 
of 93 and 74 yards as UCLA gained a 14-0 halftime edge over the Hogs, who had 
only two first downs at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 6 straight third-down plays before Mark Estwick scored on a 
1-yard run for a 6-0 Bruin lead after a scoreless first period. The extra-point 
kick made it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the first half, Aikman took UCLA on a beat-the-clock drive in which he 
fooled Arkansas (10-2) for the second touchdown. On third-and-goal from the 
Hogs' 1, he bootlegged the ball on a fake sweep then threw a touchdown pass to 
tight end Corwin Anthony with 21 seconds left for a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas' Kendall Trainor kicked his 24th consecutive field goal, a 49-yarder, 
in the third period to keep the Hogs from a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's only second half points came on Alfredo Velasco's 32-yard field goal in 
the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman made excellent use of UCLA's running game, handing off to freshman 
tailback Shawn Wills 18 times for 120 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman was closely watched by members of the downtrodden Cowboys' organization, 
who are thinking about making him the first pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Coach Tom Landry watched on television but scout Gil Brandt was in the 
press box. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman finished his career at UCLA with a 20-4 record as a starter. He hit 19 
of 27 passes for 172 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's alert defense held Arkansas to only four first downs, one by penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The clear, windless day was ideal for UCLA's passing attack. It was the first 
appearance for a West Coast team in the Cotton Bowl since Oregon played 
Southern Methodist 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A sellout crowd of 74,304 watched Aikman overcome early jitters, failing to see 
Arkansas linebacker LaSalle Harper at the Razorback 12. The interception ended 
a UCLA first-period drive that had reached the Hog 17 after an interception and 
20-yard return by Darryl Henley. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's first touchdown drive was helped by a personal foul against Arkansas' 
Otis Lloyd after Aikman had been stopped short on a third-down run. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman then completed a 10-yard pass to Reggie Moore, a 12-yard pass to Mike 
Farr, and a 9-yard pass to Brendan McCracken, all on third down, on the 93-yard 
scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
The 74-yard scoring drive was aided by Aikman's 20-yard third down pass to Paul 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 8 of 12 third down opportunities in the first half. He also 
completed passes to 10 different receivers as he read the Arkansas defense. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA lost another chance to score in the third period when Laurence Burkley 
fumbled at the Arkansas 7 and Kerry Crawford recovered for the Hogs. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second meeting between the schools. They tied, 10-10, in the 
1978 Fiesta Bowl.

FIESTA BOWL HAD TV EDGE NATIONALLY, BUT ROSE BOWL WAS BIG WINNER IN L.A. 
</P>

Preliminary indications are that more television viewers nationally watched 
Monday's Fiesta Bowl, in which No. 1 Notre Dame defeated No. 3 West Virginia, 
34-21, than watched the Rose Bowl, in which Michigan beat USC, 22-14. But the 
gap was not as large as many had expected, and in Los Angeles, the Rose Bowl 
was a big winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl drew an average Nielsen rating of 26 in L.A., compared to an 8.8 
for the Fiesta. The Rose Bowl started out with an 18.4 rating and peaked at a 
32 late in the game. The Fiesta peaked early at 13.1 and had only a 6.8 in the 
last quarter-hour. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl's average overnight rating for the nation's 17 largest markets 
was a 15; the Rose Bowl, which started a half-hour later, drew a 12.7 
</P>
<P>
Other overnight bowl ratings for the 17 major markets: Orange, 11.2; Cotton, 
10.2; Sugar, 7.6; Hall of Fame, 7.1, and Florida Citrus, 6.3. 
</P>
<P>
Final national ratings won't be available until later this week or early next 
week. LARRY STEWART

ROSE BOWL NOTES;

WIN MAKES RETIRING DUKE FEEL LIKE A KING

Wayne Duke, retiring commissioner of the Big Ten Conference, was brought to 
tears in the press box by Michigan's 22-14 victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
As commissioner for the last 18 years, Duke has been an easy target for those 
who have criticized the Big Ten's recent lack of success in the Rose Bowl. But 
now his conference has won its last two Rose Bowls, Michigan State beating USC 
last year, and Duke couldn't have received a better retirement present. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people are shaking my hand," Duke said, "but you know what, I didn't 
throw one block or make one tackle." 
</P>
<P>
In the category of outdated jokes, there's this one that was making the rounds 
before the game: Why does Bo Schembechler eat his cereal off a plate? Because 
if he put it in a bowl, he'd lose it. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Shav Glick, 68, who helped cover Monday's Rose Bowl, saw his 
first Rose Bowl game 57 years ago, when USC beat Tulane in 1932. After that 
game, Glick saw 20 of the next 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan defensive tackle Mark Messner's thoughts on playing against USC's 
Aaron Emanuel: "I didn't like it much. I hit him square on one time, and the 
next thing I know, he was 4 yards downfield." 
</P>
<P>
Messner said he missed Leroy Hoard's 61-yard breakaway run for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all huddled around Coach Carr," Messner said, referring to Lloyd Carr, 
the defensive coordinator. "We're supposed to be concentrating on our huddle, 
so if we even stand up he gets a little mad. We heard the crowd go crazy, but 
nobody moved. We didn't get to see it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Messner's impression of playing against USC's John Guerrero, a 320-pound 
tackle: "They passed so much that it was hard to get a good idea of just how 
good he is. But he certainly is classy. He'd help you up, tell you you made a 
good play. 
</P>
<P>
"Matter of fact, the entire USC team was classy. Some teams, you are out there 
and there is lots of talking and bad-mouthing. There was none of that with 
USC." 
</P>
<P>
When Rodney Peete turned a broken play into a 23-yard gain in the second 
quarter, it was the Trojan quarterback's longest run of the season -- by a 
yard. Peete wound up with 31 net yards in 5 carries and, like player of the 
game Hoard, 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few mistakes by Michigan was a dropped pass by split end Greg 
McMurtry on the USC 15. Quarterback Demetrius Brown hurled the ball nearly 50 
yards in the air, a perfect strike, but it slipped through McMurtry's hands for 
an error. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, no baseball scouts were in the Rose Bowl. McMurtry is such a hot 
baseball prospect that he was offered $172,000 to sign out of high school by 
the Boston Red Sox after they made him their No. 1 draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
How's this for a firing technique? A Big Ten source said Monday that the 
University of Wisconsin's football troubles may have very well started a year 
ago, when Athletic Director Elroy Hirsch, the Crazy Legs of Rams' fame, was 
called into the office of the interim chancellor and told to sign a sheet of 
paper that was, in essence, his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Wisconsin went 1-10 in football and its once-proud attendance 
showing, always around the 70,000 average mark despite a series of weak teams, 
slipped below the 50,000 average mark. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Tracy Dodds and Shav Glick contributed to this story.
