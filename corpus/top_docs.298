LONGHORN BORER BEETLE FOUND IN THE BAY AREA

<P>
The dreaded longhorn borer beetle that has ravaged eucalyptus trees throughout 
Southern California has been found in the Bay Area, the first discovery north 
of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Originally from Australia, the inch-long pest has no natural enemies here and 
has killed thousands of eucalyptus trees since it was first detected in this 
country five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials had hoped to contain its spread by cutting down infested 
trees and regulating the transportation of eucalyptus firewood. But since last 
month, officials have captured some of the insect's larva in three trees in 
Alameda County. 
</P>
<P>
Entomologists are uncertain how well the black-colored insect, which has long 
antennas and zigzag markings on its tough outer shell, will adapt to the cooler 
Bay Area climate. Some experts say it could kill thousands of trees in what was 
once the world's last concentration of eucalyptus groves free of borer 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a potential of killing a third of all trees" in the Bay Area, said Jim 
Laughlin, a state forester in San Bernardino County, where the beetle killed 
hundred of trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wait-and-See Attitude 
</P>
<P>
Bay Area officials say they are taking a wait-and-see attitude about the 
significance of the new pest. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment up here is more favorable to the eucalyptus than in Southern 
California. So the extent of damage shouldn't be as severe. The truth remains 
to be seen," said John Nicoles, a land management specialist for the East Bay 
Regional Park District, where eucalyptus groves cover more than 1,500 acres of 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
The true impact of the pest will be felt by homeowners who will have to pay up 
to $10,000 for removing eucalyptus trees killed by the beetle from their yards, 
Nicoles said. 
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials fear trees killed by the beetle will become fire and safety 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"Very, very hot fires develop from eucalyptus" and are harder to extinguish, 
said David Neff, a state forestry official. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imported From Australia 
</P>
<P>
Eucalyptus trees were imported from Australia at the turn of the century. The 
trees grew well in California's semi-arid climate. The trees are not grown 
commercially. 
</P>
<P>
The borer typically attacks trees that are older, unhealthy or under 
environmental stress, such as drought and frost damage, said Tim Paine, an 
entomology professor at UC Riverside. Healthy trees can thwart the beetle by 
drowning its larva with sap. 
</P>
<P>
The beetle attacks the trees by laying its eggs beneath their bark. The hatched 
larva bore deeply into the tree, drilling deep holes that eventually kill the 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
Paine said the beetle was probably shipped from Chile to California in wooden 
crates infested with beetle larva. Though the borer beetle can fly, he said it 
most likely made its way to the Bay Area by hitching a ride in a stack of 
firewood. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides are ineffective against the pest, because the larva are so deeply 
embedded in the tree, Paine said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at UC Riverside are experimenting with introducing some of the 
beetle's predators from Australia to keep the beetle population in check. 
Researchers have unleashed the Australian beetle-killing wasp, which preys 
specifically on the longhorn borer's larva. But so far, the wasp has adapted 
poorly to its new environment. "It's simply one of those things you have got to 
shrug your shoulders about. We're going to have to live with it," Nicoles said.

PEST ATTACKS DRY EUCALYPTUS

<P>
A persistent pest that saps the life out of eucalyptus trees is becoming a 
major problem in Ventura County as the drought continues, tree experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit's name is the longhorn borer beetle, and Jim Downer, a landscape 
adviser at the University of California Cooperative Extension, said this week 
it has chewed its way north from other parts of Southern California to kill the 
tall, sprawling trees in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all over the county," Downer said. "It started in Orange County, it's 
been wiping out trees in Los Angeles County, San Bernardino, San Diego, and 
it's now in Ventura and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a natural pest of eucalyptus that has no natural enemy in California," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Though tree specialists say the beetle has been present in some parts of 
Ventura County, such as Simi Valley, for at least three years, it did not 
appear to be spreading rapidly. But the combination of ongoing drought and the 
beetle has been more deadly to eucalyptus over the last year, they say. The 
parasite was first reported in Southern California in 1984 in wood that had 
been shipped from Australia to an El Toro lumberyard. 
</P>
<P>
Downer, who has been monitoring the pest but says no count has been made of the 
number of eucalyptus trees killed, said he had come across more beetle-caused 
deaths of eucalyptus "in the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for the drought, it probably would not be getting as many trees 
as it is," he said. "Trees that are experiencing drought intensifies the 
attraction of this beetle." 
</P>
<P>
When the weather gets hot, the beetle could kill more eucalyptus, said Jim 
Hughes, retail manager at Baron Brothers of Camarillo. "You don't see so much 
of it in cold weather, but as it warms up, you'll see it more." 
</P>
<P>
One recent morning, Don Schwabauer could see the effect of the pest in several 
places on the citrus ranch he operates in Moorpark. Almost every grove and 
pasture on the 700-acre ranch was bordered with towering rows of tall, 
gray-trunked eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
The trees are important both for erosion control and as a "windbreak," 
Schwabauer said, and the fact that several had been dying was troubling him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real concern," he said. "We get so much wind. We receive tremendous 
Santa Anas. They protect the citrus trees." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "We've lost quite a few." 
</P>
<P>
Looking at his trees, Schwabauer said, he was convinced that the beetles 
focused on trees that lacked water. He pointed to one nearby stretch of several 
dozen trees standing like tall sentinels beside a grove of short, bushy orange 
trees laden with fruit. "Those trees look fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But they stood next to a well-irrigated grove, he noted, and then pointed to 
another row of eucalyptus. This one stood between the road passing the property 
and an empty field of pale, dry earth. Nearly half of those trees were dead. 
</P>
<P>
"We pulled all this grove out because we'll be replanting lemons this month," 
Schwabauer said. "We aren't irrigating here, and those trees have the beetle." 
</P>
<P>
Downer drove to some places in Ojai on a recent afternoon where trees had been 
infected by the beetle. These trees were dead and had lost their color, but 
their leaves had remained on the branches. 
</P>
<P>
That is the signature of the longhorn borer, Downer said. "Usually when a tree 
declines, leaves fall. The main thing about the eucalyptus borer is that the 
leaves stay on the tree. They don't fall off." 
</P>
<P>
After a beetle lays eggs in a eucalyptus tree, Downer said, larvae hatch and 
then tunnel through the tree's cambium layer, between the bark and the wood, 
that carries essential nutrients and fluids up and down the tree. The larvae 
block that flow of nourishment, he added, killing parts or all of the tree. The 
larvae then bore into the trunk and after several days, emerge through what 
Downer called an "exit hole," as a beetle ready for a new attack. 
</P>
<P>
So far there is no known cure for the beetle. "Some pesticides have been tried, 
but they are not effective," Downer said. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Paine, an assistant professor of entomology at UC Riverside, said an effort 
in Riverside about two years ago to introduce wasps from Australia, which are 
natural predators against the longhorn borer, "did not appear to be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
The best offense, Paine said, is adequate watering, even though that could be a 
problem in Ventura with increasing limitations on water usage. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we had the eucalyptus beetle in Southern California, people considered 
them naturally maintenance-free, and felt they didn't need to water them," 
Paine said. "Then people started to take care of them, and we don't see as much 
mortality in Orange County, San Diego and Los Angeles. This will probably be 
repeated in Ventura, now that it's moving its way north." 
</P>
<P>
Affected branches or dead trees need to be removed to keep the borer beetle 
from spreading, Jerry Revard, city of Ventura arborist, said. He removed a 
large branch that showed signs of the pest from a tree bordering the Santa 
Paula Freeway about eight months ago, he said, adding, "so far, I haven't seen 
any more." Revard said he encased the diseased branch in tarpaulin. 
</P>
<P>
"If people find evidence of the beetle, bury it, burn it or cover it up with 
tarpaulin for a year," he said, "to make sure they are trapped, to keep the 
population from spreading."

<DESCRIPT>  INSECT; WAR  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  SCIENTISTS in two Bay Area counties started a quiet war last week. The
battlegrounds are ash trees, the soldiers are thousands of insects and the
generals are arborists and entomologists.;    The war began with the release
in Alameda and Santa Clara counties of stingless mini-wasps, or Encarsia
wasps, which attack ash whiteflies. Here's how it works: The mini-wasp, which,
like the whitefly, is the size of a pinhead, lays its eggs in the scales of
young whiteflies. As the wasp matures, it feeds on the whitefly and kills it.;
   The parasite was imported by scientists at the University of California,
Riverside, from Israel, home of the ash tree. Mini-wasps are natural parasites
of the whitefly and control their populations in Israel and other countries
where the trees are native.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When whiteflies infested California in the late 1980s, probably
accidentally brought in on infected trees, they thrived because they had no
natural enemies here, said Mark Beaudoin, city arborist for San Jose.;   
Efforts to control the whitefly through spraying are useless because the
insects are so prolific, he said. "We'd have to spray every seven days." And
the problem is so widespread that the insects killed by the insecticide would
soon be replaced by others from nearby trees.;    Controlling the whitefly has
been a high priority in the state, Beaudoin said, because in addition to ash
trees, the pest attacks cash crops such as pear and citrus trees and landscape
plants.;    With state funding, the UC-Riverside scientists imported the
mini-wasps and other natural parasites for the whitefly and studied them to
determine which would be most likely to thrive in California. Last year they
released the chosen mini-wasp in six Southern California counties where
whitefly infestations were most intense.;    "The program was very
successful," said Timothy Paine, assistant professor of entomology at
UC-Riverside. The scientists measured the success by releasing the parasite at
five sites and then monitoring them along with five similar sites that didn't
receive the mini-wasps. A graduate student conducting the study found that in
the areas where the parasite was released, the populations of adult and
immature whiteflies "took a huge nose dive. They dropped to very low levels,"
Paine said. In the sites where no parasites were released, whiteflies
flourished.;    Follow-up studies showed that the whitefly populations
remained low, Paine said. "And the parasite is such a good colonizer that as
the whiteflies moved, so did the parasite," he said.;    The success in
Southern California encouraged other counties to try the mini-wasp warriors,
Beaudoin says. "We were losing the battle (against the whitefly) with
traditional methods.";    To introduce the mini-wasp to the South Bay, the
Santa Clara County Department of Agriculture chose five sites -- in San Jose,
Saratoga, Santa Clara and Los Gatos -- to serve as nurseries for the parasite,
said agriculture biologist Stan Maggi.;    The mini-wasps, which were raised
in a laboratory in Sacramento, were released onto infested ash trees. "We
don't expect results this year," Maggi said. "Any tree infected has hundreds
of thousands of whiteflies. It's a long-term project.";    Importing insects
to control pests isn't new. Perhaps the most well-publicized effort was the
release of sterile male Mediterranean fruit flies to control those insects, a
program that has been fairly successful Beaudoin said.;    Another effort was
undertaken in the mid-1970s to control aphids on linden trees. Aphids, which
feed on plant sap of several species of trees, secrete honeydew that drops
from the trees, making a sticky mess.;    "The aphids don't harm the tree,"
said Bob Zuparko, a graduate student at UC-Berkeley's Division of Biological
Control who is studying the linden tree aphid and its parasite for his
doctoral dissertation.;    The honeydew, however, is a nuisance. Zuparko
worked with the group that released the linden tree aphid parasites, a
mini-wasp called Trioxys Curvicaubus, in San Jose and Berkeley.;    "The
parasite was released in 1978, and the aphid population went way down,"
Zuparko said. His current study however, reveals that the efforts have not
been a complete success. "The populations are low, but there is still
honeydew," he said.;    Linden tree aphids are not a high priority in San
Jose, because the city has very few mature linden trees and the trees need to
develop before aphids attack, Zuparko said. Most of the city's lindens are on
one street in Willow Glen, with a few single lindens in other neighborhoods.; 
  Young lindens, however, were planted along the light rail line,
significantly increasing the city's linden tree population.;    The linden
tree parasite has made its own effort to branch out. A survey by Zuparko shows
that the mini-wasp has spread from Berkeley and San Jose all around the Bay,
but has not crossed any hills. As part of his work, Zuparko plans to introduce
the mini-wasp to another area infested with linden tree aphids to further
study how the parasite works.;    Although linden tree aphids feast on only
that tree, other types of aphids attack other trees. Scientists brought in a
mini-wasp to control the tulip tree aphid with little success, said Beaudoin,
who manages about 250,000 street trees for the city of San Jose.;    One
effort that appears to be a failure was a parasite released to control the elm
leaf beetle. The parasite "was whipped out before it could get established,"
Beaudoin said. Scientists don't know for sure what killed the parasite, but it
could have been a fungus, disease or organism that prevented the predator from
flourishing. "We're messing with a complex system here," Beaudoin said.;   
Yet another tree that has fallen victim to recently imported insects is the
eucalyptus. "It used to be a pest-free plant, but now we have a pest,"
Beaudoin said. The eucalyptus long-horn beetle came from Australia, home of
the eucalyptus tree. The beetle found its way to California on eucalyptus wood
palates used to carry goods imported from Australia.;    Scientists hoping to
control the beetle must travel to Australia to study the insect and its
natural enemies, and then bring back predators and determine if they can
survive in California. If and when this happens depends on financial support
for the program, Beaudoin said. While the cash-crop attacking whitefly drew
attention and funds from the state, no one gets as excited about the
eucalyptus, he said.  </TEXT>

   A war on a bothersome insect called the
ash whitefly is being broadened with squadrons of tiny, stingless
wasps from the Mediterranean.
   The flies have no natural enemies in California and are a
nuisance to residents and a potential threat to the agriculture
industry, the state Department of Food and Agriculture said. They
were first detected in California in August 1988 in Los Angeles
County and have since been spotted in 17 counties and as far north
as Sacramento.
   The tiny insects suck out plant juices, infesting a variety of
trees and shrubs including apple, apricot, citrus and pear. They
can defoliate trees and clouds of the insects have driven residents
from their back yards.
   Now tiny Encarsia wasps, imported from Israel and Italy, are
being released and will be monitored to see how well they control
the ash whiteflies.
   The wasp controls the ash whitefly population by laying its eggs
inside fly larvae. After the wasps' eggs hatch, they eat their way
out of the larvae, killing the pest.
   Pesticides are not considered practical for use against the
whitefly because the pest's numbers are so large and it dwells on
the undersides of leaves.
   Six southern California counties have been targeted for
widespread release of the wasps, said Peter Stoddard, senior
environmental research scientist with the state Department of Food
and Agriculture. Additional counties will get the wasps later this
summer.
   One of the initial sites chosen for release of the wasps was the
Fullerton Arboretum on the edge of the California State University,
Fullerton campus, just southeast of Los Angeles. Hundreds of wasps
were released there Thursday.
   Wasps for future release are being reproduced at the University
of California, Riverside, and the rate of reproduction will
determine how quickly other sites will receive them, Stoddard said.
   A tiny ladybird beetle imported last year from Israel also is
being studied as a possible weapon against the fly.
   California also is waging a battle against the Mediterranean
fruit fly, using the pesticide malathion.

<LEADPARA>  IN 1856 the towering and graceful eucalyptus tree was imported from Australia
to California, where its trunk was valued as a mast for sailing ships and its
branches for shade from summer's heat.;   The eucalyptus was a tree that soon
took over. Californians loved it because it was drought-tolerant, resistant to
insects and fast-growing. By the turn of the century the eucalyptus had become
the most widely planted non-native tree in the state and a symbol of good
living. Wealthy Californians grew eucalyptus by the acre and framed
wood-roofed mansions in the coastal hills above San Francisco Bay with groves
of the peppermint-scented tree.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But the eucalyptus tree became another kind of symbol last week. When a
wind-driven blaze roared through the Oakland hills, drought-dry eucalyptus
trees served as torches to pass the fire along from house to house. Within
minutes the firestorm had consumed houses, people, pets and wildlife in the
Hiller Highlands.;   For California, it was a calamitous warning of what Karen
Terrill of the state Department of Forestry called "the fire of the future."
Sixty percent of this most populous state is wildlands, and trees are much
prized here.;   Californians find it difficult, Terrill observed, "to get away
from the idea that a house is only attractive if it's dripping with trees
around it. It's very trendy in California to have that western, bushy look."; 
 Western trees and bushes catch fire, particularly in time of drought. On the
same day that Hiller Highlands and homes in the communities of Upper Rockridge
and Montclair were consumed by the fast-moving blaze, a dozen forest fires
raged on 80,000 acres in the West. But except in Oakland they burned in remote
areas where homes are few and far between.;   California, long a pioneer of
much that is best and worst in America, prides itself as being on the cutting
edge. Now, pressed by drought and relentless population growth, California is
exploring the outer limits of mixing urban growth and wildlands. And the
pattern is being followed in other Western states that I have visited recently
-- Nevada, Utah and Arizona -- where tracts of homes are rising amid trees in
areas where water is a luxury.;   Neither the urban nor the wildlands side of
the equation functioned last week in the Oakland hills. Budget cuts had forced
huge reductions in the Oakland firefighting force. The fire chief was new,
water pressure was inadequate and the department's radio equipment obsolete.
White firefighters, claiming to be victims of reverse discrimination, had sued
the city in objection to an affirmative action plan that mandated the
promotion of minorities and women.;   The lawsuit was settled 10 days before
the fire, with a federal judge ruling against the white firefighters and
upholding the city's plan. But while the case was making its way to
settlement, 50 vacancies on the fire department went unfilled. By almost any
measure, there were not enough firefighters in Oakland. And on the night of
Oct. 19, after the fire department contained a six-acre grass blaze, no
firefighters were left behind on the lines to see that the blaze did not flare
up again. On Sunday, the remnants of this small fire touched off the
conflagration.;   Once the fire began, even the most modern firefighting force
could not have stopped it. Too many homes were heaped in the wooden fuel of
bone-dry chaparral and the murderous eucalyptus trees. Many of the trees may
have been weakened by the eucalyptus longhorn beetle that is native to
Australia and did not make its way to Northern California until 1988. Some
trees had also been damaged or killed by last winter's severe freeze, for the
eucalyptus tree is thoroughly Californian in its intolerance of cold.;   In
the aftermath of the fire there was talk of uprooting the remaining eucalyptus
trees in the coastal hills where homes have thrust their way into wildlands.
And there was talk, too, of controlling development and requiring that brush
and trees be cleared from home sites in wooded areas throughout the state.
Such talk was heard last summer after the devastating Painted Cave Fire in
Santa Barbara, where residents are now building again amid the trees.;  
California, with its 30 million people, is a state constrained by urban and
outdoor realities. Mixing cities with wildlands in times of drought is
tempting nature. And as rancher and California Forestry Director Richard
Wilson observes, "In a contest with nature, nature usually wins."  </TEXT>

IMPORTED BEETLE JOINS THE FRAY AGAINST ASH WHITEFLY INFESTATION

<P>
Scientists waging a biological war against the pesky ash whitefly have deployed 
a new soldier in the fight -- a tiny gold-and-brown beetle imported from 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Small swarms of the so-called ladybird beetles have been released over the last 
three weeks in Granada Hills, Gardena and Oceanside. Entomologists predict that 
the eighth-inch-long beetle -- which poses no threat to humans -- will reduce 
whitefly populations by eating juvenile flies that attach themselves to the 
underside of tree leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, researchers said thousands of stingless, parasitic wasps released 
earlier this year to prey on the whitefly appear to be doing their job. 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside entomologists do not yet have precise data on the wasps' 
effectiveness, but they have observed the predatory insect reproducing and 
attacking the pinhead-sized whitefly in five Southern California counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy with the results," entomologist Tim Paine said. A colleague, 
Tom Bellows, added that "the wasp appears to be a highly effective natural 
enemy" of the bothersome whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
First discovered in Van Nuys two years ago, the ash whitefly has spread rapidly 
throughout California, infesting 20 counties from the Mexican border north to 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The white-winged pest sucks the juice out of leaves and can defoliate entire 
trees. In the process, the bugs produce a sticky excretion that coats cars, 
patio furniture and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the insect has mostly bothered urban dwellers and nursery owners, 
munching on ornamental trees. But entomologists note that the fly is known to 
attack fruit trees, raising concerns about its threat to the state's 
agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
Imported by accident from Europe, Africa or Asia, the whitefly has no natural 
predators in California. Pesticides provide only temporary relief, with new 
swarms of whiteflies reinfesting trees shortly after they are sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, entomologists agreed that biological warfare was the only way to 
stop the pest. The speck-sized, stingless wasps were imported from Italy and 
Israel and are being mass-raised by the California Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Large releases of the wasps began earlier this year and were made in 18 cities 
in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange and San Diego counties. In 
recent weeks, researchers returned to the field to determine how their troops 
were faring. What they found was encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
The wasp attacks the whitefly by laying its eggs inside the whitefly nymph. 
Like a scene from a horror movie, the parasite's egg then develops into a wasp, 
which eats its whitefly host from the inside out. 
</P>
<P>
"In some of our research sites, if you pick up the leaves and look at the 
whitefly pupae, you'll see that tremendous numbers of them show evidence of a 
parasite emerging rather than an adult whitefly," Paine said. "The hole the 
whitefly makes when it comes out is very different than the hole the parasite 
makes, so we know when we've got success." 
</P>
<P>
Paine added that the observations were made in climates as different as the 
coast and the desert. 
</P>
<P>
The ladybird beetles were released over the last two weeks at three sites. 
Further beetle releases are planned as entomologists continue mass-rearing the 
insects. 
</P>
<P>
Paine said it will be sometime in the fall before researchers have a solid 
grasp of just how effective the predators have been in reducing the whitefly 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the entomologists hope to import still more whitefly enemies -- 
another wasp from England that might be useful in the cooler climates of 
Northern California, and a parasitic fly from Israel.

<HEAD>California Scientists Import Wasps to Attack Problem Flies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists on Friday released 50 parasitic
Israeli wasps, each smaller than a pinhead, hoping the pests would
zero in on Southern California's growing ash whitefly population.
   The wasps were sent to work in a suburban Encino ash tree in the
first of a series of tests to see if they can be used in the fight
against the problem flies.
   ``This particular trial is not to see if the wasps will kill all
the ash whiteflies,'' said Tom Bellows, a University of California,
Riverside, entomologist supervising the experiment. ``This
particular trial is to see if the wasps can live successfully in
our Southern California climate.''
   Bellows released the imported predators into what he calls a
``sleeve cage,'' a finely woven mesh cloth fitted over a tree
branch so that all of the wasps will remain in one place.
   Otherwise, scientists monitoring the experiment would have to
search the whole tree and beyond to find the wasps, Bellows
explained.
   The ash whitefly infestation is not the only agricultural battle
being waged in Southern California. Record numbers of exotic insect
pests have invaded Los Angeles County this year, posing a threat to
the state's $16 billion-a-year farm economy.
   Efforts to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly, which lays its
eggs in more than 250 types of fruit, has cost taxpayers at least
$10 million so far, county officials said.
   Scientists also are scrambling to deal with invasions by
Japanese beetles, Russian wheat aphids, gypsy moths, fire ants and
other bugs found in faraway lands _ but foreign to the United
States.
   ``We are convinced that it's because you are the nation's
melting pot,'' said Gera Curry, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Food and Agriculture in Sacramento.
   The region's booming immigrant population is bringing in
contraband fruits and vegetables from native lands, she said.
   The people responsible don't seem to realize their shipments of
produce also carry alien pests that thrive in Southern California's
warm climate, Curry said.
   One of the most ruinous is the ash whitefly, which sucks vital
fluids from tree leaves and deposits a sticky ooze that discolors
fruit, stains patios and ruins car paint.
   The ash whiteflies, which have no natural enemies in the United
States, were first discovered in the San Fernando Valley last
summer. They were apparently imported accidentally from Europe, the
Middle East or Africa, where they are common.
   The parasite wasps were imported from Israel, where they act as
the ash whitefly's natural enemy.
   The wasp has no sting, but kills by laying its eggs inside ash
whitefly larvae, Bellows said. After the wasps' eggs hatch, they
eat their way out of the whitefly larvae, killing the pest.
   If the series of experiments set for this month are successful,
Bellows said hundreds of thousands of insect predators will be
released next spring.

RAPIDLY MULTIPLYING FLY IS ABOUT TO MEET SOME UNFRIENDLY WASPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first volley in a carefully plotted biological war against the ash whitefly 
will be fired next week when researchers hunting for ways to control the 
destructive and rapidly multiplying pest release 50 parasitic wasps. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope the wasps, which do not sting humans and are smaller than a 
pinhead, will slow the spread of the whitefly, which has defoliated trees from 
the Mexican border to Sacramento and is viewed as a substantial threat to the 
state's thriving nursery and citrus industries. 
</P>
<P>
One week from today, small vials containing the tiny wasps will be uncorked 
beneath the branches of whitefly-infested ash trees in the San Fernando Valley, 
scientists at UC Riverside said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
That action will be followed later this month by similar test releases in 
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. In all, 300 of the 
specially imported wasps will be deployed this fall, with as many as 10,000 
more scheduled for release in the spring of 1990. The black-and-gold wasps, 
which were imported from Israel and Italy in midsummer and have been 
reproducing in UC Riverside's federally approved quarantine laboratory ever 
since, are parasitic insects that can only multiply by laying their eggs within 
the whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
A female wasp inserts her eggs into a juvenile whitefly, known as a "nymph," 
through a tube called an ovipositor. The wasp larvae then develops by feeding 
off the tissue of the whitefly, which ultimately dies when the wasp becomes 
mature and chews its way out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's classic biological control, and we have every reason to be confident that 
this project will succeed," said Tim Paine, an associate professor of 
entomology at UC Riverside, where scientists are working with $95,200 in 
emergency grants to combat the whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
However, even if the wasps prove effective against the whitefly, residents 
irked by the swarming pest and growers fearful of its threat to crops are not 
likely to detect any sign of population reduction for at least two years, 
scientists say. As for the 300 wasps being turned loose this month, they are 
not expected to slow the whiteflies' spread at all. Rather, Paine said, it is a 
means for determining how the imported parasites will fare in Southern 
California's winter climate. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasp has reproduced successfully in the laboratory, so we want to see how 
it does under realistic conditions," Paine said. "We also recognize there is a 
lot of public concern about the whitefly and we're anxious to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Larger releases are not possible yet because not enough wasps have reproduced, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the whitefly was first spotted in California at a Van Nuys fruit stand in 
August, 1988, state agricultural officials and scientists have mostly been 
forced to watch helplessly as the non-native pest swarmed through the state -- 
free of the natural predators that control its population in Europe and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Tests have shown some pesticides are effective against the whitefly, but only 
as short-term measures: trees are reinfested within a week. Moreover, because 
the whitefly has infested such vast areas -- many of them heavily populated -- 
widespread insecticide spraying is viewed as impractical and undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
Also, whitefly eggs have proven difficult to treat with pesticides because they 
are laid on the underside of leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, scientists are hoping biological control will do the trick, and 
eight species of enemy insects have been imported for study at UC Riverside. In 
addition to the parasitic wasps, there are wasps that paralyze and kill 
whiteflies outright as well as two predatory beetles from Israel, relatives of 
those that eat aphids on roses. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only two of the wasp species have reproduced in the laboratory, 
university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the whitefly -- which weakens and ultimately defoliates 
trees by sucking the juices out of their leaves -- was accidentally imported 
from Europe or the Middle East. While so far its destructiveness has been 
limited to shade trees and back yard fruit trees, scientists say it is only a 
matter of time before the state's $634-million citrus industry is attacked. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, the pest has made life miserable for residents in many heavily 
infested areas of Southern California, spoiling barbecues and ruining patio 
furniture and automobile paint jobs with the sticky secretion it leaves behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only been here 15 months, and its population explosion has been 
incredible," Paine said. "Last year, we could barely find it in Riverside, and 
now it's everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County Agricultural Commission member Edouard Layaye agreed: "We 
had maybe one or two calls on it last year. This year, we get 20 calls a day."

SCIENTISTS WILL UNLEASH WASP TO SLOW ASH WHITEFLY;

<P>
INFESTATION: CLOUDS OF THE PEST ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN THIS SUMMER. MEANINGFUL 
CONTROL IS YEARS AWAY.

That other menacing fly -- the pinhead-sized ash whitefly -- has returned after 
a wintertime reprieve to renew its ferocious attack on Southern California 
shade trees. This year, though, a deadly surprise might be lurking in the 
foliage for the bothersome pest. 
</P>
<P>
While an army of state agriculture officials is engaged in a full-scale battle 
with the Mediterranean fruit fly, a handful of entomologists have laid plans to 
launch the first large-scale assault against the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, they will set loose speck-sized, stingless wasps to prey on 
whitefly larvae. Between 25 and several hundred of the wasps will be dispersed 
at various Southern California locations, which scientists will closely monitor 
to determine how best to conduct a broader biological war later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The wasp releases will culminate a year of successful research that has 
identified at least one imported whitefly predator that can survive in 
California and eventually help control the flourishing populations, said UC 
Riverside scientists. Previously, it was thought that the whiteflies had no 
natural predators. 
</P>
<P>
A noticeable reduction in whitefly populations, however, is years away. It will 
take that long for wasp colonies to gain a stronghold against the pest. 
Exasperated residents, who competed for outdoor airspace with swarming flies 
during the height of last summer's infestation, can expect the same frustration 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we can expect to find a whole lot of whiteflies again just like 
last year," said Kathy Brunetti, who oversees the state Department of 
Agriculture's whitefly task force. "But with any luck we will have to live with 
this for only a few more years." 
</P>
<P>
Last September, infestations became so dense that afternoon breezes stirred up 
whitefly clouds, ruining back-yard barbecues and gatherings. Those who braved 
the swarms complained that they were often forced to cover their mouths to 
avoid inhaling the flies. Sticky dew excreted by the whitefly coated cars and 
was tracked inside homes, dirtying floors and carpets. 
</P>
<P>
"We are already starting to see them show up," said BJ Hegedus of North 
Hollywood, whose front yard is shaded by a tall ash tree. "We are bracing for 
the worst again. Although I can't imagine it getting much worse than last year. 
I can't help but think how many I swallowed." 
</P>
<P>
Public demand for whitefly relief is so strong that the locations of the May 
test releases are not being disclosed because researchers fear that homeowners 
will steal the wasps to combat their own infestations. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are calling us asking us for wasps to release in their own 
yard," said Janet White, a spokeswoman for UC Riverside scientists conducting 
whitefly studies. "We don't want people to know precisely where they are. We 
don't want them disturbed." 
</P>
<P>
In July, a panel of county agricultural commissioners will select 12 counties 
to receive limited wasp supplies. James Harnett, Orange County agricultural 
commissioner and chairman of the whitefly committee, said the wasp will likely 
be released in the most heavily infested regions. 
</P>
<P>
The ash whitefly, first identified in California in 1988 at a Van Nuys fruit 
stand, is viewed primarily as an urban nuisance by the state Department of Food 
and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The fly damages popular shade and ornamental trees, such as ash and pear, by 
sucking juice from the undersides of leaves, weakening and sometimes 
defoliating trees. It also favors apple, citrus, pomegranate and olive trees. 
The insect does not directly attack fruit. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Mediterranean fruit fly, decried by farmers and state 
officials as a grave threat to agriculture, is the target of an aggressive 
eradication campaign. The Medfly lays it eggs in a wide variety of fruit and 
vegetables, ruining the produce for market. 
</P>
<P>
Ash whitefly infestations have become fully established throughout Los Angeles, 
Orange and Riverside counties. Since 1988, the fly has invaded 16 California 
counties from San Diego to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Officials suspect that the insect had been taking hold for a year or more 
before the outbreak was noticed, but residents with infested trees did not 
report the infestation because other whitefly species commonly invade yards. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticide applications won't work against the whitefly because of the 
infestation's magnitude. Also, it is difficult to knock the fly down with 
sprays, because it lives shielded beneath leaves, entomologists said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so widespread we can't eradicate it," Brunetti said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year scientists journeyed to Israel and Italy, where the whitefly is fully 
entrenched, and brought back the Encarsia wasp species. Scientists said several 
natural whitefly enemies will be needed to establish permanent control of the 
pest. A beetle imported from Israel is under study. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe biological control is the most economically and biologically sound 
approach," said Tim Paine, a UC Riverside entomologist. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists and agricultural officials say it is impossible for homeowners to 
eliminate the fly on their property because within hours a neighbor's 
whiteflies will infest the tree. 
</P>
<P>
Paine said it would take large doses of pesticide to kill the whiteflies 
infesting a 40-foot-tall ash tree, and the attempt might burn leaves and 
further weaken the tree.

<LEADPARA>  Dutch elm disease, a fungus that has killed millions of elm trees in North
America, has been found for the first time in Gilroy.;    The discovery has
officials in this proud "Tree City USA" worried because hundreds of Gilroy's
largest and most stately trees are European elms planted in the late 1800s by
pioneer rancher Henry Miller. The species is particularly susceptible to the
fatal fungus.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The finding by state forestry officials means nearly 1,000 elms in and
around Gilroy are at risk and that residents should take special precautions
in handling the trees and their wood to prevent the spread of the fungus, said
Rick Brandini, Gilroy's urban forester.;    The infected tree was found on the
city's northeastern fringe, on the east side of Murray Avenue at Tomkins
Street, a good distance from other city elms.;    The 11-tree stand on Murray
Avenue and up to six other trees nearby, all in the 25-foot-tall range, have
been ordered destroyed by the state within 20 days and probably will be felled
Monday at an estimated cost of $1,500, Brandini said.;    The discovery means
Gilroy will be closely monitored by state forest department plant
pathologists.;    "We'll be looking closely at Gilroy every year until we're
sure it's cleared out," said Alleah B. Haley of the department's forestry pest
program.;    She said 1990 was the worst year on record for Dutch elm disease
in Santa Clara County, with 51 confirmed tree infestations, 47 of those in San
Jose.;    The Gilroy find, she said, was "not good news" because it moves the
known Bay Area range of the disease south by 21 miles.;    Except for a fluke
discovery in Beverly Hills in the 1970s, the disease in California up until
last year had been confined to the nine Bay Area counties, she said. Last
year, the disease was found in Sacramento and the delta town of Isleton.;   
Brandini said the only other species that can get the disease is the zelkova
tree, but Gilroy has only a few and most are on the high school campus, he
said.;    The Dutch elm fungus is spread by the tiny European elm bark beetle,
which carries its spores, feeds on twigs, and burrows and breeds under the
tree bark. It will breed under the bark whether the tree is alive or dying, or
whether the wood has been stacked or is in a pile of prunings.;    In fact,
dead and dying elm wood emits an odor that actually attracts the beetle,
Brandini said.;    The beetle, but not the disease, has probably been in
Gilroy as long as elms, he said.;    The initial discovery was made after
samples were taken in October during routine checks by state plant
pathologists.;    It was the first close examination of Gilroy's elms in four
years, Haley said.;    Far from major stands;    The only good news, Brandini
said, is that the infected tree is away from major stands in residential
areas, where the disease has not been detected.;    The state will take
special care when transporting the infected wood to the city landfill to be
chipped or buried, he said.;    Later, a systemic plant killer will be applied
to the stumps, which will then be removed along with roots.;    If the fungus
is found in residential areas, he said, insecticide sprays may be used to kill
the beetle. In the meantime, city crews and contract workers will go ahead
with already scheduled pruning operations on public trees, designed to strip
elms of dead and dying wood.;    Haley said California has been spared the
devastation the disease wreaked on the East Coast and in the Midwest because
elms are not native and California lacks sprawling stands of host trees.;   
In addition, a state program to keep the disease in check has operated with
good success since 1975.;    In all, state officials have inventoried 970
elms, mostly European and Siberian, in and near Gilroy. They're located on 527
parcels of property.;    The state will pick up the tab for the removal and
disposal of infected trees found on private property, Brandini said.;   
Symptoms displayed by diseased elms include portions of the tree or its leaves
wilting, then turning brown.;    The fungus clogs the tree's water-carrying
vessels, so its arboreal victims actually die from a lack of water, Brandini
said.;    He cautioned that the one-eighth-inch long, dark, fungus-carrying
beetle should not be confused with the lady bug-sized elm leaf beetle, a
different insect.;    Chewer, not carrier;  The latter does not carry the
disease and destroys leaves by chewing them, he said.;    Elm owners may
consider using sprays that kill the Dutch elm beetle in addition to carefully
pruning and burning dead or dying wood. Fall and winter are the best times to
prune elms, he said, adding that prevention is the way to deal with the
disease.;    Stately European elms, some in excess of 60-feet tall, line
Fifth, Sixth and Miller streets, among others, and represent the city's
tallest and some of its oldest trees, Brandini said.; IF YOU'RE
INTERESTEDResidents who need more information may call (408) 842-0221. If you
suspect you have a diseased elm, contact the forestry department's forestry
pest control program at (415) 837-4260.  </TEXT>

<P>
If you want more trees to grace your city but don't have the tax money to buy 
them, try starting an adopt-a-tree program or creating a memorial tree park. 
</P>
<P>
Those were a few of the suggestions that Northern California experts offered 
Wednesday during a daylong workshop in Anaheim for turning urbanized Orange 
County into a greener place. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people -- mostly parks and recreation officials from several cities 
and counties -- listened intently to members of California ReLeaf, the 
Sacramento Tree Foundation and the East Bay Regional Parks Foundation, who 
described the latest tactics in "releafing" the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We all need to care more about the trees; but it's all new to a lot of us," 
Yucaipa Councilwoman Lillian Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by California ReLeaf, which is part of the American Forestry Assn.'s 
Global ReLeaf program, the conference was an attempt to encourage Southern 
California cities to become more involved in planting and caring for trees. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments in Northern California are often thought to be the state's 
leaders in environmental concerns, and the sponsors brought lessons learned in 
that area. 
</P>
<P>
Isabel Wade, director of urban forestry for California ReLeaf, told department 
leaders that they need to involve residents and arouse community interest, 
which in turn will encourage local politicians to find funding and other types 
of support. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to build the base of public support, because without that the 
politicians are not going to lead," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Cobb, executive director of the East Bay Regional Parks District, also 
discussed the need for community involvement in planting and caring for trees. 
She said that with city budget crunches, many local governments will need to 
rely on more help from volunteers if seedlings are to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Crum, parks services manager for Anaheim, said the workshop was helpful. 
</P>
<P>
"Often citizens are tired of their trees because they're tired of raking up 
leaves," Crum said. "This is good because it helps us explain to them the 
importance of trees." LISA MASCARO

<HEAD>Drought Is Starting To Bug The West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Drought-stricken areas of the West bracing for a summer of
rationed water, parched crops and forest fires now face another
plague: hordes of hungry beetles, bees, crickets and grasshoppers
that love hot, dry weather.
   California, in its fourth drought year, just finished a winter
rainy season that yielded only 55 percent of normal precipitation.
Water supplies to central California farmers are being cut in half,
and ``drought cops'' patrol coastal cities, citing scofflaws who
defy lawn-watering bans.
   It's weather only a bark beetle could love.
   The insects are thriving on drought-stressed trees across
California. Last year, they killed trees containing 2 billion board
feet of timber, and state Department of Forestry officials predict
a similar toll this summer.
   ``In drought conditions, the trees don't produce the amount of
pitch they usually do, so when the beetles drill into the trees,
they're more successful at getting in and laying their eggs,'' said
Don Perkins, head of the forestry department's pest management
program.
   The eggs hatch into larvae, which eat the trees from the inside
out, then develop into beetles that fly off and lay more eggs.
   ``They can have three or four life cycles if you have a real
warm, dry spring and warm weather in the fall,'' Perkins said.
   Beetle-killed trees and tinder-dry weather have made
California's fire danger the worst in decades.
   ``We have hundreds of thousands of large kindling stands,'' said
Lisa Boyd, forestry department spokeswoman. ``Things are as dry
right now as we would normally see in August and September.''
   It's not beetles but bees that are annoying Northern California
tourist towns around Lake Tahoe, where swarming yellow jackets last
summer forced people from beaches and back porches.
   Even more bees are expected this summer, prompting the South
Lake Tahoe Chamber of Commerce to declare war. The group is
distributing 5,000 bait traps filled with the insecticide diazinon.
   Populations of the ground-nesting yellow jackets surge if hot,
dry weather occurs in spring when the queen bee is starting her
nest, said Roger Akre, a Washington State University entomologist.
By August, a single queen can hatch out 5,000 workers.
   In northern Nevada, officials are battling Mormon crickets,
which can grow to the size of mice by devouring vegetation, bark,
and virtually anything else in their path.
   ``They're just absolutely voracious,'' said Akre. ``They're
eating-machines.''
   State officials hope to fend off the invasion _ Nevada's largest
since the 1930s _ by spreading poison-laced bran and oil on eggs at
the mouth of canyons. The crickets hatch in the mountains, then hop
down into the valleys to feed.
   East of the Rocky Mountains, winter rains have put a green cast
on much of the Great Plains. But drought persists in North Dakota,
where some farmers have not raised a crop in two years and anxious
citizens hold rain dances and prayer meetings to plead for moisture.
   So far, all they've got are grasshoppers. Lots of grasshoppers.
   In eastern North Dakota, researchers last fall counted 1,700
grasshopper eggs per square yard, compared with a normal count of
200, said Dean McBride, a North Dakota State University
entomologist.
   North Dakota has joined South Dakota and Minnesota, also
infested with grasshoppers, to ask Congress for money to spray
pesticide on the insects' eggs. The grasshoppers can devastate
crops.
   If it's any consolation to residents gone buggy, Akre said, the
drought may eventually limit the populations of insects, which
appreciate rain once they start to feed.
   ``Rain makes the vegetation grow,'' he said. ``Otherwise,
they'll eat themselves out of house and home.''

WAR OF THE WHITEFLY; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGIES: SCIENTISTS UNCORK THEIR BIOLOGICAL WEAPON AGAINST A PEST 
INFESTATION. THEY'RE PITTING TINY WASPS AGAINST TINY FLIES.

<P>
Scientists launched the first attack in a biological war against the ash 
whitefly Friday when they placed 60 tiny parasitic wasps in a San Fernando 
Valley park. 
</P>
<P>
Perched atop ladders in Encino's Balboa Sports Center, researchers reached into 
nylon mesh bags that had been wrapped around branches of two infested trees and 
uncorked several narrow, inch-long vials containing the predators. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just taken a small step on a long journey," said Los Angeles County 
Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are hoping for marked progress by 1991 but say it will take up to 
five years to bring the whitefly under control. 
</P>
<P>
The gold and black wasps, imported from Israel, look like dust specks and are 
about half the size of a pinhead. They do not sting humans and can only 
multiply by laying their eggs within immature whiteflies. As the eggs develop, 
the growing wasps consume their host from the inside out, said Larry Bezark, a 
pest management specialist with the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The whitefly has invaded trees from the Mexican border to Sacramento since it 
was first discovered at a Van Nuys fruit stand 14 months ago. Researchers fear 
the pest, accidentally imported from Europe or the Middle East, could spread 
through most of the state by next year because it has no natural enemies here. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very serious," UC Riverside entomologist Tom Bellows said as he stood 
beneath a tree infested with tens of thousands of whiteflies. "This is one of 
the most serious infestations of a foreign insect in the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's controlled release, coordinated by scientists at the University of 
California, Riverside, and the California Department of Food and Agriculture, 
is the first in a series of such test releases planned this month in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
The wasps will breed inside the mesh bags, enabling scientists to monitor their 
progress. In all, 300 of the wasps will be deployed in the bags this fall, with 
as many as 10,000 or more scheduled for similar tests in the spring of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The test releases will help scientists determine if the wasp can survive the 
California winter outside the laboratory. Researchers are optimistic, noting 
that the wasps thrive under similar climatic conditions elsewhere. 
Entomologists also will be testing wasps imported from Italy, where the 
whitefly is kept under control by natural conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The white-winged pest sucks vital juices from leaves, weakening and eventually 
defoliating trees. Ash and pear trees are its most common victims, but loquat, 
pomegranate, citrus, toyon and others are also at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides have been unsuccessful for several reasons. Chemicals have a 
difficult time penetrating the waxy coat of the whitefly, and their eggs are 
difficult to reach because they are laid on the underside of leaves, Bellows 
said. Also, the sheer number of whiteflies, which Bellows estimated in the 
billions in the Los Angeles basin, make the use of pesticides impractical and 
undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to attempt that approach when there is such a good, 
environmentally sound alternative," Bellows said. 
</P>
<P>
Although damage so far has primarily been confined to shade trees and back-yard 
fruit trees, officials warn that the non-native pest poses a severe threat to 
the state's nursery and citrus industries. "There is a great potential for 
loss," Bellows said. 
</P>
<P>
In parts of Europe where the whitefly has gained a foothold, up to half the 
pear and apple crop has been destroyed, he said. "But we'll beat it before it 
happens here." 
</P>
<P>
Since the whitefly sucks more juice from plants than it can use, it leaves a 
sticky ooze in its wake that discolors fruit, stains patio furniture and ruins 
automobile paint. Residents throughout the basin have complained that the 
swarming pests, which stick to hair and clothing, have ruined back-yard 
barbecues, driving traditional outdoor activities inside. 
</P>
<P>
The biological control program, funded by government agencies, grower groups 
and the University of California, has cost less than $100,000 so far, Spaugy 
said. But Bellows estimates the biological control program will cost $120,000 a 
year for up to six years. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Tarzana) said Friday that he will introduce 
an urgency measure when the Legislature reconvenes in January that will provide 
$2 million over the next five years to combat the whitefly in California.

STATE STILL HOPES TINY WASPS WILL BEST WHITEFLIES; 
</P>
<P>
BIOLOGY: DESPITE MIXED RESULTS SO FAR, EXPERTS HAVE FAITH THAT WASPS IMPORTED 
FROM ISRAEL AND ITALY WILL BE ABLE TO ERADICATE THE PESTS. EXPERIMENTS ARE 
CONTINUING AT UC RIVERSIDE.

<P>
Despite an ambiguous showing in an Encino park, state agricultural experts have 
not lost faith in the tiny Israeli wasp they want to use as a weapon in the war 
against the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two months, researchers pitted the wasps against whiteflies in 
the Balboa Sports Center in Encino, yielding inconclusive results. But in a 
more closely monitored test in Riverside, researchers said, the wasps 
reproduced and fed on the whiteflies, which damage fruit and shade trees and 
shrubbery. 
</P>
<P>
The whiteflies have spread throughout California, and a state official said 
Wednesday that wide release of the wasps, which are harmless to humans, could 
begin this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Ash whiteflies weaken and eventually defoliate trees by sucking vital juices 
from their leaves. The insects also exude a sticky substance that can damage 
patio furniture and automobile paint. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more than encouraged," said Kathy Brunetti, program supervisor for the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture. "We're convinced that 
bio-control will be our weapon against the whitefly." 
</P>
<P>
Bio-control refers to the use of natural predators to kill an undesirable 
insect, instead of chemical methods. To combat the whitefly, the state has 
begun breeding tiny Encarsia wasps, imported from Israel, in Riverside. "We are 
anticipating right now to have a large-scale release sometime this spring," 
Brunetti said. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was discovered about two years ago in a Van Nuys fruit stand, the ash 
whitefly has invaded trees from the Mexican border to Sacramento. The insect, 
normally found in Europe and the Middle East, has spread quickly because it has 
no natural enemies in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of it as the Pilgrim Fathers' Syndrome," Brunetti said. "The Pilgrims 
came here and left their enemies behind in Europe. Now we're going back there 
to bring their enemies over here." 
</P>
<P>
She said a spring release of the wasps in Southern California will probably be 
followed by a late summer release in the northern portion of the state. 
</P>
<P>
With funding and staff help from government agencies and grower associations, 
Tom Bellows, an entomologist at UC Riverside, has been trying to determine 
whether the imported wasps will reproduce in Southern California's climate and 
attack the whitefly. In November, Bellows released about 60 of the parasitic 
wasps in the Balboa Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
But when he checked the experiment early this month, he could not tell whether 
the wasps had multiplied and fed on whiteflies. He said the trees that might 
have provided such evidence had lost their leaves because of cold weather. 
However, a similar test closer to his laboratory provided more promising 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"We put 123 wasps in Riverside," Bellows said. "Seven or eight weeks later, we 
found evidence that reproduction had occurred, and the wasps were successfully 
established. We found 97 dead whiteflies that had been killed by the wasps. 
That's very encouraging for that size of an experiment." 
</P>
<P>
He said similar experiments are under way in San Bernardino, San Diego and 
Orange counties, and include the use of wasps imported from Italy. Bellows said 
he plans to test still other wasps and a breed of beetle to find the most 
effective whitefly predator. 
</P>
<P>
The imported wasps lay eggs within immature whiteflies, and the developing 
wasps consume their hosts from within, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 16, state Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) introduced a 
bill that would provide $2 million for control of the whitefly over the next 
five years, using only natural predators. "We don't think there will be any 
opposition at all," said Karin Caves, a spokesman for the legislator.

<HEAD>Exotic Pests Threaten Farm Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lured like other visitors to California
by the warm climate, record numbers of exotic insects are invading
Los Angeles County and posing an unprecedented threat to the state's
$16 billion a year farm economy.
   As of July, 1,185 potentially harmful pests have appeared in
California, including fruit flies and gypsy moths, fire ants,
Russian wheat aphids, Japanese beetles, mealy bugs and scales.
   ``We are being literally swamped,'' said Rosser W. Garrison, a
county entomologist who supplied the statistics. ``The variety of
insects is increasing, and the sheer number is increasing.''
   Besides the climate, Los Angeles has become a magnet for imported
insects because of the ease of international travel. More than 3.7
million foreigners passed through U.S. Customs at Los Angeles
International Airport last year, and at least some presumably
slipped fresh fruit and vegetables past inspectors, officials said.
   One of the new pests, the ash whitefly, already has reached
epidemic proportions in Southern California and is racing for the
state's agricultural heartland _ the San Joaquin Valley in central
California.
   The city, a hub for commerce with Asia and South America, boasts
a burgeoning immigrant population with a taste for fruits and
vegetables from their native countries.
   ``They have friends and family who are sending them a taste of
home,'' said Robert G. Atkins, a deputy county agricultural
commissioner.
   Atkins said that although Los Angeles County's farm production is
negligible, the county acts as the entry for pests to the rest of
the state _ the nation's leading agricultural producer.
   He noted that California's belated response to a Mediterranean
fruit fly infestation drew widespread publicity nine years ago,
eventually costing the state $100 million to exterminate and farmers
$100 million in losses. But similar invasions lately have become
almost mundane.
   ``I hate to stress that, because I don't want people to believe
that the bug is any less dangerous,'' Atkins said.
   Nevertheless, three medfly infestations have occurred in the
county within the last 12 months, each costing roughly $1 million to
eradicate and each drawing comparatively scant public attention.
   The county's budget for plant quarantine last year was more than
$784,000, an almost 54 percent increase over fiscal year 1977-78,
officials said.
   Treatment methods vary for different types of fruit flies, but
early detection is a fundamental strategy, made possible by checking
more than 160,000 baited traps set throughout the state.
   ``It's almost like battling forest fires,'' Garrison said. ``It's
a lot easier to put it out as soon as it gets started.''
   Discoveries of less notorious pests are charted each month by
Garrison, whose microscopic scrutiny detected five new types of
insects in the county last year and three so far this year.
   Although agriculture officials have established methods of
dealing with fruit fly infestations, other kinds of insects can be
neither readily identified nor exterminated.
   One of the most ruinous new pests, the ash whitefly, apparently
hitchhiked to the suburban San Fernando Valley from Europe or the
Middle East. It has no natural enemies in California and its numbers
are exploding.
   ``It is totally out of control,'' Atkins said. ``The only thing
limiting the population is the number of trees they have to eat. It
is expanding as fast as it can, and chemical (pesticide) control is
just totally not feasible.''
   Although fruit flies, which lay their eggs in hundreds of fruits
and vegetables, are like a cancer, Atkins said the ash whitefly acts
more like a low-grade virus. It attaches itself to the underside of
leaves and slowly sucks the life out of trees.
   At first, agriculture officials were unconcerned because they
believed the tiny new invader only attacked ornamental trees like
the ash, Atkins said.
   But they later discovered the ash whitefly thrives in dozens of
varieties of trees, including olive, pear, apple and peach trees.
   To combat the ash whitefly, agriculture officials have dispatched
an entomologist to France and Italy to collect several varieties of
Encarsia, pinhead-sized wasps that are the insect's natural enemy.
   If tests prove successful, millions of the tiny wasps could be
released come winter, though it probably will be years before the
wasps can significantly reduce the ash whitefly population.

Last fall's biological warfare experiment against the ash whitefly, which has 
attacked trees in at least 15 California counties, was successful in killing 
the destructive pests, researchers reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
However, ash whitefly experts said they need more money to continue the 
research that could provide a long-term solution to the ash whitefly problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We could really be set back if the University of California was unable to 
continue its research," said Peter J. Stoddard, statewide coordinator for the 
Department of Food and Agriculture's ash whitefly project. "It's kind of hard 
to keep ahead of this insect." 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture departments throughout Southern California, including Orange 
County's, have funded the research. But agricultural commissioners said funding 
also needs to come from other parts of California because the problem has 
become statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Resendez, a Southern California spokesman for the Nursery Growers Assn. 
of California, said his group plans to lobby state legislators for additional 
support. "It's really important to our industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fight against the ash whitefly is being waged with imported parasitic 
wasps, one of the whitefly's natural enemies. About 300 wasps were dispersed in 
small groups last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The wasps destroy the fly either by attacking it or implanting it with eggs 
that consume the fly from the inside out as the egg matures. 
</P>
<P>
The microscopic wasps, which do not grow stingers, have been the best weapon 
against the pinhead-size flies, which have been unaffected by pesticides since 
being discovered in Southern California 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bellows, a UC Riverside entomologist who is heading the biological 
eradication research team, said the researchers were "very pleased" with the 
wasps' performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Food and Agriculture, in joint effort with the UC Riverside 
researchers, plans to disperse thousands of additional wasps this spring in a 
full-scale attack against the flies. The pest, which attacks trees by sucking 
the juice from leaves, has so far affected apple, peach, pear, plum, apricot, 
pomegranate, lime and kumquat trees. 
</P>
<P>
But Bellows warned against relying solely on the wasps to wipe out the billions 
of flies in the Southland. He encouraged the development of additional natural 
enemies of the flies, such as an imported beetle, which are currently being 
studied at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot that we don't know about the natural enemy of this bug," he 
said. "It will take repreated and consistent effort."

LOGGERS STRIPPING FORESTS, GROUP SAYS

California's largest timber companies are "strip mining" the state's forests 
while regulators stand by and watch, the environmental group Clean Water Action 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from the state Department of Forestry and reports from the East 
Bay Municipal Utility District and other utilities, the environmentalists said 
stepped-up logging is fouling water supplies and threatening to force water 
agencies to install costly filtering systems to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Increased production also is hastening a fundamental change in the industry 
itself -- from using large, old trees to produce high-quality solid-wood lumber 
to using small, young trees to make particle board and other processed-wood 
products, according to the environmental group's report. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released three weeks before voters will decide the fate of three 
timber-related ballot measures, was discounted as political hyperbole by 
industry spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the shift to particle-board production) is a natural progression from an 
old-growth-based economy to a young-growth-based economy," said Shepard S. 
Tucker, a spokesman for Louisiana-Pacific Corp. in Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
But Patricia Schifferle, author of the Clean Water Action study, said that 
young-growth forests and the highly automated methods used to harvest them are 
inconsistent with laws stating that California's forests be used only to yield 
high-quality forest products. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the California Department of Forestry, at the current rate of 
harvest, in 10 years, the industry will virtually run out of all mature trees," 
Schifferle said in her report. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators appointed to oversee logging often are loggers themselves, 
working as consultants or subcontractors for the companies they are asked to 
regulate, Schifferle said.

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;

<P>
42 EUCALYPTUS TREES MUST BE REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has voted to remove 42 eucalyptus trees infested with the 
Australian eucalyptus beetle borer, an insect that drains sap through holes in 
the trees' bark. 
</P>
<P>
The trees have lined Jean Lacouague's 5-acre property on San Juan Creek Road 
since he planted them in 1939 to help protect citrus and walnut trees on his 
family ranch, the San Juan Capistrano native said. But the insects have 
destroyed the trees beyond salvage and they must be taken down. 
</P>
<P>
Lacouague wanted to remove the trees in 1987 because their disease posed a 
costly liability when branches fell onto San Juan Creek Road during storms. In 
order to preserve the trees, the city agreed that year to be responsible for 
those costs. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, the council unanimously agreed to remove the trees, end the 
2-year-old agreement, and reimburse Lacouague for up to $1,000 in personal 
legal fees that he has incurred to have the trees removed. 
</P>
<P>
Lacouague said he will replace the trees with 41 California live oaks, 65 
Canary Island pines, and 50 oleanders along his property.

FIRM TO REMOVE DEAD TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has awarded a $50,000 contract to remove 
584 dead eucalyptus trees and clear dead branches from 284 other trees, all on 
city-owned parkland. 
</P>
<P>
The areas slated for the work make up about 10% of the public parkland and 
include the infested areas that are most visible to the public. 
</P>
<P>
The work, which will begin in about two weeks, is the city's first major effort 
to combat the Australian eucalyptus long-horned borer beetle, which is killing 
eucalyptus trees in many areas of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The inch-long beetle, which deposits its eggs under the bark of eucalyptus 
trees, was brought to the area in wood shipped from Australia in 1984. It has 
since proliferated from San Diego to Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the contract, Travers Tree Service, a Lomita firm, must bury the 
tainted wood in a landfill.

<LEADPARA>  The December freeze killed heavy brush and millions of trees that are now
primed to burn. March rains nurtured grass that soon will turn tinder dry. All
that after five years of drought parched the landscape.;    Unless an
unusually cool summer intervenes, these are the ingredients for what could
become one of the worst wildfire seasons in California's history.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Right now the rains have caused everything to green up, but that can
change in a few weeks," Lisa Boyd, a spokeswoman for the California Department
of Forestry and Fire Protection in Sacramento, said Monday. "The state's
really a tinderbox this year. Everyone's going to have to be extra careful."; 
  In Santa Clara County, the conditions are not yet extreme; March storms
probably delayed fire season until mid-June.;    But the county's wild lands
are littered with heavy fuel -- brush and trees -- killed by the drought or
the December freeze.;    "The late rains have given us a real good grass crop,
the catalyst to ignite heavier fuels," said fire prevention officer Dick
Mauldin at the forestry department's Morgan Hill ranger unit.;    Particularly
vulnerable are the eucalyptus groves that did not survive the freeze, Mauldin
said. "Fires in there are going to be particularly hot, hard to put out," he
said.;    Statewide, according to the U.S. Forest Service, 10 percent of the
trees in the 18 national forests have been killed by the drought or the insect
infestations it spawned.;    State forestry officials estimate 10 million
trees -- Boyd called them "standing kindling" -- have died in California's
wooded areas since the drought began.;    California's worst fire year was
1987, when 900,000 acres burned. Summer weather will be the key to how severe
this fire season is.;    "If we get into a period of temperatures in the 90s
and 100s and it stays that way for a week or so, there is some real potential
for major fires," Mauldin said.;    Firefighters are most concerned about
rural areas of the South Bay and East Bay where people have built homes among
heavy vegetation.;    "We preach every year for homeowners to take precautions
(such as clearing brush from around their houses), and a lot of people don't
do it," Mauldin said. "They think 'it's never going to happen to me,' and when
it does they start pointing fingers.";    Mauldin said the Morgan Hill ranger
unit will begin manning some of its seasonal stations Monday, begin hiring
summer season firefighters June 3, and have all of the back-country stations
opened by July 1.;    The Morgan Hill unit covers parts of Santa Clara,
Alameda, Contra Costa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin and Merced counties.;    In
Alameda and Contra Costa counties, officials also are bracing for a long, hot
summer. "We don't want to say this is the worst fire season in X years, but we
are gearing up for it," said Ned MacKay, spokesman for the East Bay Regional
Park District. "We have to be prepared.";    Statewide, the biggest fire
threat looms in the chaparral-covered coastal mountains south of Santa
Barbara, where the moisture content of trees and shrubs is the lowest ever
recorded for this time of year, Boyd said.;    "Every year the drought
continues, the conditions get more explosive, but we can't say for sure what
is going to happen this year," Boyd said.;    Two of the forestry department's
22 ranger units -- both in Southern California -- are fully staffed for the
fire season now, Boyd said, and all are expected to be ready by mid-June.;   
California doesn't face the fire threat alone.;    Officials at the federal
Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates firefighting efforts
throughout the West, said parts of 11 states in the far West, and North Dakota
and Minnesota, also face major fire danger this year.;     Wildfire
precautions; The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection advises
residents of rural areas to take special precautions to protect their homes
from wildfires this summer:; (box)Clear at least a 30-foot defensible space of
brush and dry grass around your house. On some properties, such as those on
the ridge tops, the clear area should be as much as 100 feet wide. The break
doesn't have to be bare dirt, but could be planted with fire-resistant
vegetation.; (box)Remove all pine needles and leaves from your roof, eaves and
rain gutters.; (box)Trim tree limbs within 10 feet of your chimney and trim
all dead limbs hanging over your house or garage.; (box)Install a spark
arrester on your chimney. They are available at hardware stores.; (box)Treat
wood shingle roofs with fire retardant on a regular basis.; (box)Make sure
there is adequate access for firefighters to get to your home, and ensure that
neighborhood streets are clearly identified.; (box)Further information can be
obtained from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's fire
prevention unit in Morgan Hill, (408) 779-2121.; Source: California Department

MANDARINS ARE EASY TO GROW IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If asked to choose the best orange for eating fresh, most people would probably 
name the navel orange, a choice that is hard to dispute. But I feel that a 
mandarin orange, left to ripen to perfection on the tree, would give the navel 
close competition in eating qualities. 
</P>
<P>
The mandarin orange belongs to the largest citrus family, many members of which 
are erroneously called tangerines. But no matter what they are called, 
mandarins form a citrus group whose fruit provide luscious eating and whose 
trees make a beautiful addition to the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The different mandarin varieties produce fruit that ranges in color from a deep 
reddish-orange to a very light orange. One quality that all the mandarin 
varieties share is that they are easy to peel and to separate into segments for 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
Florida produces more mandarins than any other state and California ranks 
second. It is in the Orient, however, and especially in Japan, that the 
mandarin enjoys the highest level of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five Varieties 
</P>
<P>
Most parts of Southern California, from the low deserts to all but the coldest 
areas, provide acceptable growing conditions for the mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
If you would like to add a mandarin tree to your yard, you might consider five 
varieties that are usually available in local nurseries: Owari Satsuma, Kinnow, 
Kara, Clementine and Honey. 
</P>
<P>
Owari Satsuma is my favorite. It has a sweet, tangy and yet mellow flavor that 
is hard to describe unless you've sampled it yourself. It is the most 
cold-tolerant of the mandarins and also thrives in the coastal valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnow has yellowish-orange fruit with a rich flavor and marvelous citrus 
aroma. The tree has an unusual willow-like shape that is most decorative. 
</P>
<P>
Kara was developed in California. It produces large, bright orange fruit with a 
distinctive flavor. It is the juiciest of all the mandarins; it does not 
produce well in our desert areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plant in March 
</P>
<P>
Clementine generally grows on a small tree that produces beautiful, red-orange 
fruit. For best production, Clementine requires another variety, such as 
Kinnow, planted nearby for cross-pollination. 
</P>
<P>
Honey produces very sweet fruit. It prefers the warmer interior valleys and is 
not a good bet for coastal areas. 
</P>
<P>
Most mandarin varieties are available in standard and semi-dwarf-size trees. If 
your local nursery doesn't have the mandarin tree of your choice, ask them to 
order it for you from a wholesale grower. 
</P>
<P>
March is an ideal month to plant mandarins in the coastal valleys. In colder 
areas, wait until late in the month or April. Purchase only healthy, 
vigorous-looking transplants. Avoid trees with long trunks. If the transplant 
has any fruit on it, pick it off so that the tree's energy can be used to 
produce foliage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test Drainage 
</P>
<P>
The tree must be planted in a sunny area. Dig a hole twice as wide as the root 
system, but only as deep as the soil the tree was originally grown in. 
</P>
<P>
Test the soil for proper drainage by filling the planting hole with water. Let 
the water drain completely, then fill it again. If the water does not drain out 
within 12 hours, choose another planting site or refer to a soil guide for 
corrective methods. Improper drainage is the primary reason that young trees 
don't survive. After testing, place the tree in the planting hole and refill 
the hole with the soil that you originally removed. 
</P>
<P>
Planting time is a good time to add slow-release fertilizer tablets. Such 
tablets will provide long-term nutrient release without burning the roots. They 
are also ideal for fertilizing established trees. Follow label directions 
carefully. To assure the roots of moisture, water during the planting process. 
</P>
<P>
After planting, if there is no rain, water the new trees twice a week, daily 
during Santa Ana winds or hot spells, for the first six weeks. Then, if there 
is still no rain, start watering weekly. Deep watering is necessary, but keep 
water away from the lower trunk area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paint Trunks 
</P>
<P>
When you plant new trees in hot-sun areas, the trunks should be painted with 
white-wash or wrapped with trunk band (available at most nurseries) to prevent 
sunburn damage. 
</P>
<P>
The only pruning necessary is to remove dead wood or frost-damaged branches, or 
for decorative purposes. As far as pests are concerned, aphids and scale can 
pose problems. Consult your nursery staff for ways to control them.

COUNTY MOUNTS CHEMICAL WAR ON ORIENTAL FRUIT FLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reaching his arm through a hole cut in the truck's window, Bill McCartney 
pointed a spray gun at a tree on a Monrovia sidewalk and fired. 
</P>
<P>
The truck rolled on toward a utility pole, leaving a spritz the size of a 
dinner plate on the tree. The bait contained a scent that attracts the male 
Oriental fruit fly laced with an insecticide that will remain deadly for two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, four flies were discovered on grapefruit, guava and orange trees 
within a square mile in Monrovia and Arcadia. If one more fly is trapped in the 
same area, a quarantine restricting the movement of home-grown produce could be 
imposed, Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy said in a 
recent statement. 
</P>
<P>
Since Oct. 11, McCartney has been squirting trees -- his arm protected from the 
mist by a plastic sleeve taped over his window -- in the battle to eliminate 
the pest from the two cities. For at least another two months, more than 600 
applications per square mile will be made every two weeks over a 
nine-square-mile area in Monrovia and neighboring Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the Oriental fruit fly has caused an infestation in the 
San Gabriel Valley, said entomologist Becky Jones of the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
A quarantine on 65 acres in and around West Covina was lifted earlier this 
month. About 70 square miles in the Silver Lake and Echo Park area is under 
quarantine after the discovery of five flies during routine inspection of traps 
in back yard fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very busy year for fruit fly infestations, particularly for 
the Oriental fruit fly," Spaugy said. The pest has been detected in the county 
12 times this year. 
</P>
<P>
The aerial spraying of malathion used in Mediterranean fruit fly eradication is 
not necessary here because state and county bug specialists have found a more 
powerful weapon in "a tremendously attractive male lure," said Bob Atkins, the 
county's deputy agricultural commissioner in charge of pest prevention. 
</P>
<P>
In the "male annihilation technique," the enticing methyl eugenol is mixed with 
the pesticide Naled, which kills both on contact and upon ingestion. 
</P>
<P>
If that seems like a lot of attention for a lowly insect, it is with good 
reason. The fly could cost the state $44 million to $176 million in pesticide 
expenses, crop losses and quarantine restrictions if it isn't successfully 
eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
Originally from Southeast Asia, the fly has become a major pest in Hawaii, 
since it was introduced in that state in the 1940s. One of the most harmful of 
all fruit flies, the species attacks more than 250 varieties of fruits and 
vegetables, including important California crops, such as citrus, avocados and 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
The fly is a notoriously strong flier that has traveled 30 miles in search of 
food and a place to lay eggs. As a result, infestations can spread quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly larger than a housefly, with a yellow-striped abdomen and yellowish 
legs, the Oriental fruit fly begins its 90-day life cycle in the pulp of a 
fruit or vegetable, after the female deposits 10 to 100 eggs under the skin of 
her target. 
</P>
<P>
Maggots hatch and tunnel through the fruit for nourishment, turning their host 
into a rotten, mottled mass. Sometimes the fruit drops from the tree 
prematurely as a result, said state pest control specialist Roger Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
The larvae either drop from or crawl out of the fruit to burrow as far as an 
inch into the soil to continue developing. Adult flies emerge within 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
Fly traps throughout the state are checked weekly all year, Faulkner said. 
</P>
<P>
When a fly is caught, trapping is intensified and fruit in the area is 
inspected for the creamy-white larvae. Because there are so many varieties of 
flies, any maggots found are dropped into a vial of alcohol and mailed to 
Sacramento, so that state entomologists can confirm the identification. No 
larvae have been found in Arcadia or Monrovia, Faulkner said. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit from infested countries must be fumigated before entering the state, but 
often untreated produce is carried in by mail or travelers. County, state and 
federal agricultural officials will be meeting later this month to discuss ways 
the pests are slipping into California and how to stop it, Spaugy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>

* The discovery of four Oriental fruit flies in Monrovia and Arcadia earlier 
this month was the second time the flies have been found in the San Gabriel 
Valley this year. To eradicate the flies, officials are treating a 
nine-square-mile area. A quarantine imposed in July on 65 acres in and around 
West Covina was lifted last month.

   A century after an Agriculture Department scout
found an Australian beetle that saved California's citrus crop, the
government on Wednesday announced an escalation of it bug-vs.-bug
program of biological warfare against nature's pests.
   The department said agreements had been reached to send American
scientists to China and the Soviet Union this summer to search
unexplored areas for natural enemies of destructive insects and
weeds.
   ``We're raising the priority of making biocontrol a vital part of
American food and fiber production,'' said R. Dean Plowman, head of
the Agricultural Research Service.
   Taiwanese-born pathologist Yang Shaw-Ming will go to Inner
Mongolia in search of a fungus that can destroy the leafy spurge, an
aggressive weed which drives grazing cattle and horses away from
rangeland at a cost to ranchers that he estimated at $50 million.
   At the same time, five Agriculture Department scientists will go
to the Soviet Union to look for enemies of the Russian wheat aphid,
a pest that was appeared in Texas three years ago and has spread
into 15 states.
   Working with their Russian counterparts, they also will try to
find biological controls to use against grasshoppers, the leafy
spurge, the Russian thistle and a number of other pests.
   Scientists said the problems that plague farms and backyards
alike often arose because crops brought into this country were
frequently accompanied by pests _ but not by the pests' natural
enemies.
   The announcement was made at a ceremony marking the first big
victory, a century ago, in biological controls.
   Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers recalled that victory.
He said in 1888 California's citrus trees were covered by the large
white egg sacs of the cottony cushion scale, threatening the state's
fledlging citrus industry.
   The USDA dispatched a scout, Albert Koebele, to Australia to look
for a natural enemy of the pest. He found one feeding on scale in a
garden in North Adelaide _ the black and orange Vedalia beetle.
   Twenty-eight of the beetles were released in California on Nov.
30, 1888, and the problem was under control within a year.
   Since then, hundreds of biological control agents have been
introduced in American agriculture, sparing the environment from
tons of chemical pesticides and saving farmers millions of dollars.
   To mark the occasion, an exhibition was opened to show how
predatory beetles, aggressive parasites and deadly disease organisms
are used to keep agricultural pests in check.
   William Metterhouse, who directs the Division of Plant Industry
in New Jersey's Agriculture Department, said 40 percent of America's
``economically important insects'' have been found abroad.
   He said shade trees across this country would be infested with
the gypsy moth, a caterpillar that eats the foliage of more than 500
tree species, if it were not for nine parasites and two predators
brought in from overseas. Now a virus has been developed by USDA as
a weapon against the gypsy moth, Myers said.
   Metterhouse said New Jersey farmers have had to spray eggplant
fields as often as 15 times a season to control the Colorado potato
beetle. Now a South American egg parasite is being introduced this
summer and may solve the problem, he said. Ways are being sought to
use the parasite to control the beetle in potato and tomato fields
too.
   Myers used the occasion to announce success in a 30-year, $10
million battle against the alfalfa weevil, the largest biological
control effort in U.S. history.
   The campaign has put a parasitic wasp imported from Europe into
virtually every alfalfa field in the country, the department said.
   At one time, farmers spent up to $1 billion a year on pesticides
but the weevil was so persistent that many farmers gave up growing
alfalfa, an important forage crop. Now farmers need spray only one
year in six.

<LEADPARA>  Kermit and Betty Smith are so upset they've fired off "help us" letters to a
string of city, county and state officials and the board of the Irvington
Square Homeowners Association.;   What's upset them are tiny ash whiteflies,
thousands of them -- maybe millions -- that invaded their property in
Irvington about a year ago. Since then, the leaves of the ash tree on their
front lawn have become a fly nursery.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Smiths call it "a growing epidemic that constitutes a public nuisance
and a safety hazard." They said the fly droppings create a "goo that seriously
impairs driving visibility. In addition to affecting automobile paint, this
sap is tracked into the house and all over rugs and linoleum.";   The ash
whiteflies, one of the most recent insects to invade California, can make
outdoor life miserable, testified Betty Smith, standing in front of her home
on Yorktown Road.;   "When you're outside, you have to keep your mouth shut or
they'll get in," she said.;   The whiteflies, which are attracted by the ash
trees along the street, can become so plentiful "that I can say without
exaggeration that you'd think it was snowing," she said.;   The whitefly,
first spotted in July 1988 near a fruit stand in the Los Angeles suburb of Van
Nuys, is mostly an urban problem, said Alameda County Agricultural
Commissioner Michael Greene. It defoliates trees, drips sticky, messy
droppings and swarms in dense clouds during the summer months. "It can be
nasty at a backyard barbecue," he said.;   The pest favors ash, pomegranate
and flowering pear trees. Its larvae suck plant juices from the underside of
leaves. It is pesticide-resistant and has few natural enemies.;   Whiteflies
somehow migrated here from either Europe or the Middle East. In three years,
the pest has spread over most of California, Nevada and Arizona.;   Greene
said that this summer, his office launched a war against the fly by releasing
1,000 stingless Encarsia wasps, an enemy of the whitefly. Two hundred and
fifty were released in Fremont, Livermore, Pleasanton and Hayward.;   The
little wasp, like the whitefly, is the size of the head of a ball-point pen.
The wasp lays its eggs in the scales of young whiteflies. As the wasp matures,
it feeds on the whitefly and kills it.;   The wasp was imported from Israel,
home of the ash tree. The wasps are natural parasites of the whitefly and
control their populations in Israel and other countries where the trees are
native.;   Greene said it is too early to tell who is winning the war. He
could not predict how long the war will go on.;   The wasp will never
eradicate the whitefly, but it should reduce whiteflies to a level where they
are no longer noticeable, Greene said. "They'll never be gone, but we can get
it down to a dull roar," he said.;   Meanwhile, small infestations of the
whitefly can be partially controlled with Lilly-Miller Fruit and Berry Insect
Spray. It is a mixture of malathion, methoxychlor and aromatic petroleum
solvents. This controls the adults and the larvae. The oil kills the eggs.
Spray weekly until control is achieved, says MercNews garden columnist Bob
Chapman.;   Betty Smith said she tried spraying.;   "But it didn't work. The
flies just came over from a neighbor's tree."  </TEXT>

<P>
CHARGES SOUGHT AGAINST DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California State Police said Wednesday that they will seek a vandalism charge 
against a builder who allegedly hired a tree cutter to fell a 75-year-old 
Bishop pine so he could have an unobstructed view of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Dennis Michael Hall, the owner of Mission Tree Service in San 
Clemente, was arraigned in South County Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel on a 
misdemeanor vandalism charge. Hall, 35, is being held at the Theo Lacy Jail in 
Orange, where he is serving a four-month sentence for possession of narcotics, 
violation of probation and indecent exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Aaron Tassin of the California State Police declined to identify the 
builder but said Hall's arraignment "in no way signaled" the end of the state's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Hall) had no other motivation to cut down the tree other than to get 
paid," Tassin said. "This is a high-dollar crime that eventually comes out of 
the pockets of taxpayers . . . and we want the payer (of the cutter) to be 
financially liable." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the California Department of Transportation said the 45-foot 
conifer, which was a landmark on the Camino de Estrella on-ramp of north 
Interstate 5, was leveled on May 12, two days after Caltrans maintenance 
supervisor Alan Kato intervened to prevent Hall and his crew from chopping it 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Wednesday that they were saddened by the felling of the tree. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids played on it, it was a noise barrier, and it provided us with lots of 
privacy," said Estelle Peters, whose house was partially shaded by the pine's 
boughs. "When I came home and saw it gone, I felt as if I had lost a close 
friend." 
</P>
<P>
Kato said the tree's size and age made it "irreplaceable." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Hall could receive a year in jail and be ordered to pay 
restitution for his alleged involvement.

TINY ASH WHITEFLY LAYING SIEGE TO TREES AND TEMPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carol Mueller, a gardening enthusiast, has abandoned her hobby because a 
swirling white cloud of pinhead-sized flies has invaded every corner of her 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
When the Van Nuys woman must go outside, she wears two bandannas to protect her 
hair and ears. She waves her hands to keep tiny flies off her body and 
frequently coughs and puffs air out her nose. 
</P>
<P>
"It's driving me crazy. They are all over. You wonder if you are breathing them 
in," she said, exasperated. "It's horrifying. When I touch my plants, a cloud 
rises up in my face." 
</P>
<P>
In the final days of summer, the wrath of the ash whitefly, a pest without 
enemies, reached an explosive crescendo throughout Southern California, 
attacking millions of trees and prompting an unprecedented outcry from 
fly-tormented homeowners, especially in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
From Van Nuys to Glendora in Los Angeles County and throughout most of Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, thousands upon thousands of residents 
who have long found cool comfort beneath their shade trees are under siege by 
what is perhaps the most menacing insect to have swept into residential 
neighborhoods, agricultural officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbecues have been canceled or ruined. Patio furniture has stayed in the 
garage. Housework has doubled. Many residents have purchased car covers and 
others keep a bucket of cleaning solution on hand to wipe flies and their 
sticky droppings off windshields. 
</P>
<P>
Windows stay closed. The insects stick to hair like dandruff. Simply chatting 
outside with a neighbor is an arm-flailing exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had anything that comes close to matching the citizen-based outcry 
over this," said Bob Atkins, Los Angeles County deputy agricultural 
commissioner for pest prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"They are everywhere. Everywhere!" said Lynn Olson of Glendora, whose front and 
back yard trees are teeming with flies. "Some days I feel like taking an ax to 
every tree on the block. It's so frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
In the last several weeks, Atkins said his office has received up to 200 calls 
a day from fly-tormented homeowners, forcing officials to install a tape 
recording. Throughout the county, local city officials say they too are 
receiving scores of calls. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no good news for callers. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually nothing can stop the flies, entomologists said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immune to Sprays 
</P>
<P>
They multiply with lightning speed and have wax-coated wings that are almost 
immune to pesticide sprays. Residents who do spray find only a few hours 
respite from the swarms and inadvertently kill insects that can be beneficial 
to gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Others have turned to drilling holes in their trees and inserting intravenous 
capsules that leach pesticides in the hope that lethal doses will eventually 
flow far enough to kill the leaf-sucking flies. Agriculture officials 
discourage the practice because it is only a temporary fly killer and repeated 
boring kills trees. 
</P>
<P>
As a last resort, some residents are screwing high-pressure nozzles on their 
garden hoses and shooting water on their infested trees in an attempt to blast 
away the pests. 
</P>
<P>
The flies come right back. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is tell people to deep water and fertilize their trees to keep 
them as healthy as possible," Atkins said. "Unfortunately, that's not what 
people want to hear. We are used to quick kills with pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
The flies attack a wide variety of trees, attaching themselves like white 
crusts and laying eggs on the undersides of leaves. The flies are slowly 
sucking the life out of two of the region's most popular shade trees -- ash and 
ornamental pear. 
</P>
<P>
But they also have an appetite for others, including loquat, pomegranate, 
Christmas berry, peach and plum. They will also latch onto citrus, but it is 
not a primary "host tree," agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Infested trees will "live under stress" for several years before dying. 
</P>
<P>
The flies, which were first detected in July, 1988, by a Van Nuys 
vegetable-stand owner, have no natural predators in Southern California, the 
first North American region to host the fly. The insect is a native of Europe 
and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the ash whitefly was identified by state entomologists, it had 
spread throughout Los Angeles County, free from European species of wasps and 
ladybugs that control the flies in their native lands. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials say the main hope for ash whitefly control is to import 
the enemy insects. This week, a state entomologist who is in Italy sent back 
two boxes of the stingerless wasps and ladybugs to UC Riverside, where the 
insects will be studied. 
</P>
<P>
If the predators can survive and breed in Southern California, feed off the 
whitefly and not become destructive pests themselves, they could be turned on 
the ash whitefly as early as next spring, said Thomas Bellows, UC Riverside 
associate professor of entomology and the whitefly expert supervising the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Then, it would take anywhere from two to eight years before residents will 
detect any kind of population reduction, agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Early predictions of devasting effects on the state's $831-million-a-year 
nursery industry have not come to pass, state agricultural officials and 
several large growers said. The infestation has not struck the mammoth 
$634-million citrus industry either. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the flies have been mainly attracted to big, healthy trees growing 
along residential streets and shading the back yards of homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Infested trees rain droplets of a molasses-like substance -- the ultimate 
insult, fly excrement. When the flies swarm, the excretion floats through the 
air and settles like sticky dew. Dead, sticky leaves turn moldy and drop onto 
the sticky ground. The sweet substance attracts ants. 
</P>
<P>
"The floor, the furniture, the mini-blinds, everything is coated with sticky 
stuff," said June Amacher, 67, of Glendora. "Leaves stick to the cat, my feet 
stick to the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Two houses down from Amacher's, the Huntington family keeps a bucket of soapy 
water and a squeegee on the porch to wash their car windows. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pain. Every time I drive, I have to clean the windows or else I can't 
see," said Troy Huntington, 17. "And if I walk outside barefoot, it doesn't 
feel so good." 
</P>
<P>
In Whittier, Sylvia Ochoa, 34, said a recent back yard gathering was ruined 
when flies began swirling around her guests. First, her friends thought the 
nearby hills were on fire because so much ash was floating in the air. 
</P>
<P>
No, Ochoa told them, it was the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
"Then for some reason the flies were attracted to the ladies with hair spray," 
Ochoa said. "It was kind of funny, they all left with white flies stuck to 
their hair." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 miles south, Lorean Wirt of Cerritos was dumbfounded several weeks ago 
when she found that her gold car parked beneath the ornamental pear tree was 
covered with a white veil. When she brushed the vehicle, flies swooshed up 
toward her. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disgusting," the 30-year-old woman said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she dreads seeing neighbors on her way out to her fly-swathed car. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even want to open my mouth and say hello. I just nod my head, wave and 
get in the car as fast as I can. It's the safest thing to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Van Nuys, the flies were so thick on Enfield Avenue that resident Tom 
Spicklemire is reluctant to fire up the barbecue and grill himself a steak. 
</P>
<P>
"The second you take the meat off the grill, flies start landing on it," he 
said. "It's miserable." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Mueller across the street echoed the wishes of many who have found 
themselves under ash whitefly siege. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping for a cold, wet winter," she said. "Maybe that will take care of 
the little devils." 
</P>

PEOPLE: BUG-BUSTER HELPS MAKE COUNTY A SAFER PLACE TO PUT DOWN ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

J. Nicholas Nisson's job doesn't bug him. His job is bugs. 
</P>
<P>
As the only entomologist employed by the county agriculture commissioner's 
office, Nisson helps to detect insects that hitchhike on goods brought into the 
county from other states and countries and threaten crops. 
</P>
<P>
I "wouldn't trade it for anything," said Nisson, whose constant task is to 
preserve crops worth millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nastiest and most dangerous critters Nisson has helped to battle is 
a little brown beetle from Australia named the eucalyptus longhorn borer. First 
discovered in the United States in 1984 at an El Toro eucalyptus grove, the 
inch-long beetle has killed thousands of eucalyptus trees since then. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of its discovery, the beetle already was established in the county 
and probably had been for several years, Nisson said. It was too late to 
eradicate them, and the county's efforts then -- as now -- were limited to 
controlling or reducing their population, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The beetle is now part of the county's insect fauna and continues to affect 
eucalyptus trees that are old or weak, Nisson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those types of insects are exotic pests. . . . They are the weeds of the 
insect world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Nisson, 32, doesn't want to perpetuate any prejudices against bugs in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that the vast majority of insects are not considered pests," he 
said. "They're just another form of animal life. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you see a bee fly in the yard, doesn't mean you have to get 
upset," he said. "Most insects you can live and get along with just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Even his wife "is becoming more and more tolerant" of insects. "I have 
enlightened her," he says jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are ignorant of the insects in their back yard, and that is 
unfortunate," Nisson said. He also bemoans the fact that most people view bugs 
"as nothing more than insects and something repulsive to them." 
</P>
<P>
Nisson said his interest in insects began when he was a child and his parents 
owned an orange orchard in Tustin. He studied biology at Cal State Fullerton, 
receiving undergraduate and master's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The fun of entomology, he said, is that the scientist is always discovering. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, (insects) have been a frontier in biology," he said. "There 
are so many of them that, as an entomologist, I will never see it all. There 
will always be something new." 
</P>

<LEADPARA>  WHEN you visit your doctor, you often take along a specimen in a small jar
that you pass along to the nurse as rapidly as possible.;    The past few
weeks people have been bringing me small jars with specimens. There are two
differences. I don't have a nurse (not a bad idea, though) and most of the
specimens that come to my office are alive and running around the jar;    One
such specimen that arrived this week was one of the more unusual found in the
area. Picture a praying mantis' body with a giraffe's neck and head. The fact
that it slightly resembles a mantis is fortunate because it saves it from
being blasted with pesticides by people who shoot first and ask questions
later.  </LEADPARA>

Dan Pratt is a certified nurseryman in Sacramento.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The person who brought in this specimen was asking questions first, and the
answer is that it is a very beneficial insect called a snakefly.;    They are
found over much of the Pacific coast, hiding under loose bark on trees or in
litter at the base of a tree.;    The reason for hanging around trees? Both
adult and larvae stages of snakeflies are predators of wood-boring insects
that attack trees.;    Since we have been having a serious problem with borers
attacking so many of our tree varieties, I hope we will see a lot more
snakeflies in the near future.;    There are several other beneficial insects
you should watch for on trees and plants right now. Let's start with the
leatherwing beetles. As the name indicates, the wings are the color of
leather, very old leather. The rest of the body and the head can range from
light orange to almost red. Size varies from a third to half an inch depending
on how well you feed them.;    What do you feed a leatherwing beetle? Aphids,
aphids and more aphids. On cherry, plum and apple trees, where there has been
the all-time greatest crop of aphids. After a visit from the leatherwings
there are just piles of white aphid bones.;    Most people would quickly
recognize the distinct red and black colors of the adult ladybug. It is one of
the most familiar insects, even to those who are not gardeners. There are also
ladybugs that are plain red (no spots) or navy gray and just as effective in
controlling pests.;    Even more effective pest control is performed by the
larval stage of any of the ladybugs. The soft body is shaped like a tiny
alligator, is dull gray-black in color and is covered with short spines and
yellow or orange spots in the middle of the back. Unfortunately, at least a
dozen times a week, I have people bringing in ladybug larvae in those little
bottles, wanting to know what to spray to get rid of these "pests" they think
are attacking their plants.;    The most important part of logical pest
control is knowing what you need to control. When you find an insect that you
don't recognize, put it in one of those little bottles and bring it to the
nursery or to a University of California Cooperative Extension office for
positive identification. If it's a bad guy, we will tell you how to control
it. If it's a good guy, we will tell you how to encourage it. If enough of you
bring in specimens, I just may need to get a nurse.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  A tiny parasitic wasp waging biological war on the tree-blighting ash whitefly
appears to be thriving in Southern California, one year after being introduced
at dozens of sites over a 12-county area.;    The wasp has been so successful
in the Riverside area that scientists have had to institute strict precautions
to ensure wild wasps do not wipe out the colony of ash whiteflies they
maintain in the laboratory for research purposes.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  IMPORTED WASP IS OFF TO FLYING START IN BIOLOGICAL
WAR ON WHITEFLY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It sounds a little strange, but we're at the point where we have to
protect our whiteflies from the parasites," said Tim Paine, a University of
California, Riverside entomologist.;    Buoyed by the success of the stingless
wasp imported from Israel, state agricultural officials began a second wave of
releases in Northern California last week that eventually will extend to an
additional 13 whitefly-infested counties, including Santa Clara, Alameda and
San Mateo counties.;    Informal surveys of secret Southern California release
sites last month found that most wasps not only survived last winter's freeze
but multiplied to the extent that some can be collected and spread elsewhere,
officials said.;    "The progress so far is very encouraging, and if it
continues at this pace we should see significant reductions in ash whitefly
populations in a few years," said Larry Bezark, manager of the state's ash
whitefly biocontrol program.;    Complaints from Los Angeles County residents
about the whitefly are down, a result county Agricultural Commissioner Leon
Spaugy attributes to the killing effects of the freeze as well as the wasps'
depredations.;    First spotted in July 1988 near a fruit stand in the Los
Angeles suburb of Van Nuys, the ash whitefly has been primarily an urban
problem, defoliating trees, dripping sticky, messy honeydew and swarming in
dense clouds during the summer months.;    Favoring ash, pomegranate and
flowering pear trees, the whitefly's larvae suck plant juices from the
underside of leaves. Pesticide-resistant and lacking natural enemies, the pest
-- a native of Europe and the Middle East -- has spread through most of
California and into Nevada and Arizona.;    Bred in laboratories in Sacramento
and Riverside, the black-and-gold Encarsia wasps are released to lay their
eggs on whitefly larvae. After the eggs hatch, the wasps eat the larvae from
the inside, emerging when they mature.;    Although the wasp will never
eradicate the whitefly, the tiny parasite -- along with other natural enemies
that may be released later -- should reduce whiteflies to a level where they
are no longer noticeable, officials said.;    The arctic front that clamped
California in its icy grip last December killed thousands of ash whiteflies,
leaving scientists worried that the wasps would suffer a similar fate.;    But
last month's surveys by state and county entomologists found most wasp
colonies had survived -- even in one Santa Barbara County location where the
temperature had dropped to 25 degrees, Bezark said.;    "In a large majority
of the release sites -- seven out of eight in Los Angeles County, for example
-- the number of parasites are up and whiteflies are down," he said. "They are
even turning up in places you wouldn't expect them to be in.";    Researchers
found the wasps had traveled unaided up to 18 miles from one of their original
release points in Riverside County and about half that distance in neighboring
San Bernardino County, he said.;    The wasps' success there and in San Diego
County will allow scientists to carry out the program's second phase: using
the new colonies as nurseries where wasps can be collected for distribution
elsewhere.;    In Tulare County, where December temperatures dropped as low as
15 degrees, surveys of release sites have not yet found any wasps, said Dennis
Haines, staff biologist for the county agricultural commissioners' office.;   
Because the San Joaquin Valley has greater extremes of heat and cold than most
of Southern California, scientists will be carefully monitoring the progress
of wasps released this summer.  </TEXT>

   To most gardeners in this country, whiteflies are
minor nuisances that look like flakes of dandruff when disturbed.
But forget foreign invaders like killer bees, fire ants and
Japanese beetles. The ash whitefly now is in the United States.
   So far it's been spotted mainly around Los Angeles, but Dave
Langston, entomologist for the University of Arizona-State
Extension Service, says there are some suspicious areas in Arizona
and he's pretty sure confirmed outbreaks will be found this summer
in this state and possibly others.
   That would be consistent with California's experience.
``California Agriculture,'' published by the University of
California, says in the January-February edition that since the
first North American report of ash whitefly in the summer of 1988,
``populations have reached extraordinary levels in Los Angeles
County and may affect fruit and nursery crops throughout the
state.''
   The scientific name of this super whitefly is Siphoninus
phillyreae. First recorded in 1835, it's now known in most of
Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, southern Russia, Pakistan
and India. Natural enemies limit severe outbreaks in the Old World.
Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any on this continent.
California is experimenting this spring with imported biological
controls, including a tiny wasp.
   Meantime, gardeners should be prepared.
   Insecticides never have been effective against even our native
whiteflies. But for the most part, damage has been isolated.
   The ash whitefly is like comparing a tiger to a cat. Climate,
hot or cold, doesn't seem a problem. It reproduces in about 25 days
and passes through four stages, all of which feed by sucking sap
from leaves. There frequently are reports of clusters on every leaf
of a mature tree. Adults often are inhaled or caught in people's
eyes. Known hosts, besides ash trees, include citrus, olive,
pomegranate, jujube, apple, peach, pear, loquat, apricot, plum and
many ornamental shrubs and trees.
   The common name, ash whitefly, was applied in this country after
the first ones were found on ash trees. In Europe it's usually
known as the pear whitefly or peach whitefly, because of damage to
those crops. Some textbooks call it the pomegranate whitefly.
   Whiteflies were more numerous than usual last year in Arizona.
Is it possible some were ash whitefly?
   ``Not a chance,'' says Langston. ``Once you get this one you'll
know it. Trees turn yellow. Some die. It's not like now, when you
get just honeydew and whiteflies flying around. These aren't
necessarily any bigger in size, but they feed a lot more and suck
large quantities of fluid. So there's major symptoms on foliage.''
   ``California Agriculture'' says, ``Populations grow to enormous
densities ... often covering 100 percent of available foliage and
producing substantial amounts of honeydew and sooty molds.''
   To entomologists, appearance of the species is unique because of
40 to 50 tiny, dorsal, siphon tubes in the pupal stage. But
whiteflies are too small for gardeners to spot this. So damage will
be the clue.
   ``I think this summer we'll see a couple isolated cases in
Arizona where we'll have to treat for it,'' says Langston. ``What
we'll use I have no idea, since I understand nothing works.
Biological control probably is the ultimate answer.''
   Pesticide treatment, in the California experience, may be
successful in small areas, such as nurseries. Sprays or water or
insecticidal soap seem to reduce the population on smaller plants.
However, re-infestation is likely from nearby vegetation.
   Many nursery-trade groups and government agencies, including the
California Department of Food and Agriculture, are participating
with the University of California in the biological control
program. Encarsia wasps supplied by Israel and Italy have been
promising in field tests. The wasps reproduce by laying eggs inside
ash whitefly nymphs, which are eaten by the wasp larvae.
   The ash whitefly probably entered this country on plants sent to
Los Angeles either by air or sea, according to ``California
Agriculture.'' Infestation in Los Angeles County was widespread
when first reported. Just-detectable levels were found then in an
adjoining county. However, between the following spring and autumn,
that infestation grew to nearly equal that in Los Angeles.

<P>
Fred Beams was at the beach in Dana Point when he noticed a mother and her 
daughter near hysterics about a giant, flying green bug. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just panicked," he said. "They were waving their arms up and down 
trying to get it. They thought it was a bee." 
</P>
<P>
But Beams, the assistant manager of the Orange County Vector Control District, 
knew the bug was a harmless green fig beetle. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Please don't be alarmed by what they are,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Beams admitted the creature is "one of the scarier beetles. They have that 
green color. In fact, in Egypt, they once used them as money." 
</P>
<P>
Summer is the prime time for spotting the green fig beetle. At this time of the 
year, when the ground gets warmer and the winds are calm, beetles, bugs, 
spiders and ants seem to be everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes the climate so attractive for people here makes it attractive for 
bugs," Beams said. "All insects are temperature dependent. Here it is warm year 
round so they can survive." 
</P>
<P>
Although bugs are more active and reproduce at a greater rate in the summer, 
many do little to harm people except to scare them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all big and scary and look like they'll take a small child," Beams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Vector Control District's worries are over smaller bugs: 
mosquitoes. Almost any still water outdoors can be a breeding ground. Vector 
Control workers have been spraying areas such as the San Joaquin marshes near 
UC Irvine and salt marshes near Huntington and Seal beaches. 
</P>
<P>
They have a more difficult time tracking places such as unkept pools and golf 
course hazards, which are on private property. So far this summer, they have 
found 3,500 such pools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of control over people's back yards," Beams said. "It's 
really up to the homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
Unkept pools can produce 150,000 to 200,000 mosquitoes a week, Beams said. 
Mosquitoes even have enough room in a coffee can of water to breed 700 to 1,000 
offspring a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For exterminators, most of the problems this summer have been indoors. Fleas 
and ants have been especially prolific. 
</P>
<P>
"It really kind of hit this year," said Phil Naman, the acting manager of 
Terminix's Costa Mesa branch. "When it's hot and dry, they just go crazy. 
Everybody who calls us says they've got the worst cases in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Rankin of Santa Ana, owner of Freckles the dog and Frosty the cat, said 
he has battled fleas with pesticides for so long, "I figure my yard is a toxic 
waste dump by now." 
</P>
<P>
But Rankin's problems go beyond fleas. His big problem this year has been June 
bugs. Rankin recently planted some cherry brush trees, and soon the June bugs 
were out to attack. They created blister-like bumps on the the trees' leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had (lots of) June bugs," he said. "They suck all the goodness out of 
the trees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time of the Year for Ants 
</P>
<P>
This also is the time of the year when ants move from back yards and into 
homes. Lee Clifton, the vice president of Hydrex Pest Control of California, 
said his company is receiving more calls from hot, dry areas such as Anaheim 
Hills, Placentia and Yorba Linda, where ants are fleeing their normal habitats 
for the cool indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Cockroaches also like to infest homes. One of the most common, the Oriental 
cockroach, also known as the black beetle or black water bug, is found in cool, 
damp areas such as water meter boxes and dense vegetation. And Orange County 
has plenty of American and German cockroaches, which can destroy food, fabrics 
and book bindings. 
</P>
<P>
But, Beams said, "I'll take a cockroach any day over a housefly." Houseflies 
carry germs, and can land on exposed food and regurgitate. 
</P>
<P>
Some pests also carry diseases. The most publicized this summer has been the 
Western black-legged tick, a known carrier of Lyme disease. One Laguna Beach 
woman was suspected of having the disease, but a recent test proved negative. 
Even so, the tick has been found in places all over the county that have deer, 
which are known carriers of the tick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ash Whitefly Arrives 
</P>
<P>
Another new arrival is the ash whitefly, first discovered in the county late 
last year. The ash whitefly attaches itself to the underside of leaves and can 
slowly kill trees. The flies secrete a honeydew that causes black, sooty mold 
to form on citrus, peach and other fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
The ash whitefly, which is native to the Mediterranean region, has grown 
rapidly this summer because it has no natural enemies in Southern California, 
said Nick Nisson, an entomologist at the Orange County Agricultural 
Commissioner's Office. 
</P>
<P>
"Being new and being exotic, it doesn't really have the parasites to keep it in 
check," Nisson said. 
</P>
<P>
The ash whitefly also is almost impossible to kill without soaking the entire 
plant in insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wasp Will Be Captured 
</P>
<P>
To combat the ash whitefly, state officials are sending an entomologist to 
France and Italy next month to capture the Encarsia, a smaller than 
pinhead-sized wasp that is the insect's natural enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Rankin isn't particularly fond of any of these creatures. He's having 
enough trouble just identifying them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had these bugs that are green and fly," he said. "Some of these things 
are bigger than baseballs. They'll knock you over. 
</P>
<P>
"Lord knows what can live out there."

<LEADPARA>  THE EXPERTS say don't use pesticides to control those swarms of whiteflies in
your yard because pesticides will kill the good-guy predator insects, too.;  
But what about organic, or natural, controls? And what about the all-important
dormant sprays applied to deciduous fruit trees in winter?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Here are some of the questions our readers are asking, with the answers
from entomologists and other sources:;   Q Can I spray my fruit trees with
horticulture oil, or will this hurt the wasps and parasites?;   A Gardeners
planning to use dormant sprays or chemicals to prevent peach leaf curl needn't
worry about harming the ash-whitefly parasites, says Dr. Tim Paine, assistant
professor with the University of California, Riverside, entomology
department.;   The whiteflies -- and the parasites -- live on tree leaves.
Since dormant oil sprays are applied after the tree drops its foliage, the
insects won't be present.;   The whiteflies and parasites will spend the
winter on trees that don't drop their leaves such as citrus, evergreen pear,
pyracantha and toyon. Those trees shouldn't be sprayed, Paine says.;   Q I've
had good luck with a homemade spray of Ivory soap and water. Now I'm wondering
if this is a good idea?;   A You can use non-detergent household soaps such as
Ivory Snow, Ivory Liquid or Shaklee's Basic H with varying degrees of
success.;   Start with from one teaspoon to one tablespoon of soap per gallon
of water. Rodale's "Chemical-Free Yard and Garden" ($23.95) warns that all
soaps, whether homemade or commercial, will damage plants if used repeatedly
or mixed at high concentrations. Three successive sprays on any particular
plant should be the limit.;   Keep in mind, also, that all soapy sprays are a
type of insecticide, and Paine, for one, isn't thrilled with the method.;  
"Spraying soap works. It's a poison, a chemical. But there are problems with
spraying anything. Like spraying pesticides, they only work for about a week
and then the trees are reinfested. If you spray a lot of plants with soap, you
break down the cuticle and the plant is susceptible to burning," he says.;  
"We don't know if it kills the parasites, but we have no reason to believe
that it doesn't. It's better to let the parasites build up. Let them go to
work," he says.;   Q What's the story on sticky whitefly traps? Are they worth
the effort?;   A We've gotten mixed reviews on this. Whiteflies are attracted
to a specific shade of yellow so they can be trapped on boards painted that
color and coated with a sticky material. The down side is the predator insects
may be trapped, also.;   In "Common-Sense Pest Control" (Taunton Press,
$39.95), the suggestion is to cut cardboard or plywood into 1-by-2-foot pieces
and paint them on both sides with Rustoleum Yellow No. 659. After the paint
dries, coat both sides with a sticky substance such as Tanglefoot, Tack Trap,
or Stickem Special. Then hang the boards as close as possible to the plants
infested with whiteflies.;   John Louzensky of Saratoga says he has had good
luck using yellow Penzoil containers coated with motor oil. He picked up 30
empty containers at a gas station, coated each one with STP motor oil and set
them on the ground around his yard. "I used to have swarms of whiteflies. I
notice my neighbors are doing the same thing now," he says. Once a week he
wipes off the containers and repeats the process.;   An adhesive that is easy
to remove, according to "Common-Sense Pest Control," is two parts petroleum
jelly such as Vaseline, or mineral oil, to one part household detergent or
insecticidal soap. Apply a thin coat on yellow boards or yellow containers.;  
There are also commercial sticky whitefly traps available.;   Whether the
traps really make a difference is another matter. Paine, for one, says, "If
it's satisfying to people to do it, and they want to watch whiteflies die, go
ahead.";   "But," he says, "you're talking about (killing) several thousand
whiteflies with the traps and there are millions or billions in the
population. We can't tell anyone they can't use them, but they aren't going to
make a major impact.";   Q I read about using a vacuum to suck up whiteflies.
Does this work?;   A Like the sticky whitefly traps, vacuuming may work but it
won't make a major impact on the whitefly swarms. There is also the risk of
sucking up parasites and wasps.;   "Common-Sense Pest Control" says vacuuming
should be done in the early morning when whiteflies are cold and slow-moving.
Use a small, hand-held battery-operated vacuum such as Dustbuster Plus.;  
After vacuuming up the adults, enclose the bag in plastic and put it in the
freezer for 24 hours to kill the insects. Don't put the whole vacuum in the
freezer because it will be damaged.;   On the flip side, if the adult
whiteflies have been around awhile laying eggs, vacuuming alone will not halt
the infestation, write "Common-Sense Pest Control" authors William Olkowski,
Sheila  Dear and Helga Olkowski. They are founders of the Bio-Integral
Resource Center (BIRC) in Berkeley.;   Q Whitefly are particularly bad on my
lemon tree. Has the combined effects of the drought and last year's freeze
weakened this tree and made it more likely to be damaged by whiteflies?;   A
The experts say there is no particular link between the two. But common sense
indicates that trees that have had a hard time, especially the citrus trees,
would be unable to combat a whitefly invasion.;   Water these weakened trees,
and once a week blast off the whiteflies with a spray of water.;   Q I've read
about the whitefly's predators. Are they really effective? How long will it
take for them to do their job?;   A The predators, a tiny wasp and a beetle,
were imported from Europe and Africa, home of the ash whiteflies. When the
predator insects were released in Southern California in 1989, the population
"fell 10,000-fold," said Tim Paine, assistant professor of entomology at
University of California, Riverside. "We used to average 100 whitefly nymphs
per leaf. We now average one nymph per 100 leaves.";   If those same predator
insects do their job in the South Bay, Paine said, "Two years from now you'll
be saying, 'Something is different here. We can't find whiteflies.' "  </TEXT>

WORST FIRE SEASON IN DECADES SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prolonged drought, bark beetles and a rare fungus are drying out and killing 
brush and trees that surround many Southern California neighborhoods, creating 
the potential for one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades, fire officials 
warned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A map released Monday by the Los Angeles County Fire Department showed that 
some of the most vulnerable fire zones can be found this summer in 
chaparral-covered foothill and mountain-canyon slopes beside densely developed 
residential districts of Los Angeles and its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
The map was released as the state Department of Forestry officially opened the 
region's 1990 fire season, which means its firefighting crews have been placed 
on higher alert and various fire prevention regulations are now in effect. 
</P>
<P>
While the fire-season announcement came only two to three weeks earlier than 
usual in the vulnerable foothills, it was a full two months ahead of schedule 
in the heavily wooded mountain terrain of Southern California's national 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
"The last really good rainfall was back in '82-83, so our brush really hasn't 
recuperated in seven years," said Gordon Rowley, a fire management specialist 
with the U.S. Forest Service. "Unless we get a hurricane or something -- and 
that's not very likely -- we're going to have a very bad year." 
</P>
<P>
Rowley said other Western states also are experiencing drought, "which means 
they won't be able to send us the firefighting forces they normally can deploy 
out here. . . . It doesn't look good." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, which has an annual average of 14.93 inches of rainfall, has 
received 6.18 inches so far this season, promising to make this the driest 
season in 30 years. The rainfall season, which runs from July 1 to June 30, is 
almost over for 1989-90, and Southern California seldom gets much measurable 
rain in late May and the month of June. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982-83, 31.25 inches of rain fell on the city, more than twice the seasonal 
average. But since then, the annual rainfall here has averaged only 11.57 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
Rowley said the long drought has weakened the vegetation in Southern 
California, making it more vulnerable to disease and infestation by pests. 
</P>
<P>
He said that with normal rainfall, pine trees are vigorous enough to fight off 
bark beetles, which bore into trunks and limbs to lay their eggs. He said 
healthy trees repel the insects with a flow of pitch that suffocates them and 
forces them out of the bark. 
</P>
<P>
But during the current dry spell, the trees haven't been able to produce enough 
sap to rid themselves of the beetles. Rowley said the insects have 
proliferated, killing vast stands of pines and leaving tinder-dry fuel for 
fires. The problem is acute in the Cleveland and San Bernardino national 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
In foothill districts closer to Los Angeles, a fungus that preys upon 
drought-weakened brush has killed as much as 60% of the chaparral in some 
portions of the Santa Monica and San Gabriel mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The fungus, first observed about eight years ago, attacks broad-leafed plants 
such as mountain lilac, manzanita and sumac, some of the more fire-resistant 
species of brush. Officials said large patches of this dead and dying brush now 
mottle the hillsides, ready to burst into flame at the slightest spark. 
</P>
<P>
And because of the drought, even the live brush is more incendiary than usual, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Scott Franklin, a vegetation management officer with the county Fire 
Department, said the dead trees and dry brush combine to form a fuel source so 
volatile that "any ignition now could become a major fire." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials generally have responded to the threat with increased training 
and requests for federal money to pay for extra firefighting personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Each densely thicketed acre of hillside chaparral contains about 60 tons of 
brush, he said, and that 60 tons has about the same fuel energy as 3,750 
gallons of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, if you put 80 m.p.h. winds -- the kind of Santa Anas we get in September 
-- behind all that, a fire can consume 100 acres a minute and keep right on 
going," Franklin said. "You're talking an energy release equivalent to several 
nuclear events, the energy of a number of Hiroshimas." 
</P>
<P>
The county Fire Department map shows that the most threatened residential areas 
include a number of hillside and canyon communities within the city of Los 
Angeles, including parts of Baldwin Hills, Hollywood, the Los Feliz district, 
Tarzana, Encino, Sherman Oaks, Sunland and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Especially threatened suburban communities include portions of Rolling Hills, 
Rancho Palos Verdes, Beverly Hills, Glendale, Pasadena, Altadena, Arcadia, 
Monrovia, Bradbury, Duarte, Azusa, Glendora, Claremont and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Allen, a fire prevention officer with the state Division of Forestry, said 
residents should clear tall grass, brush, trash, firewood and other 
combustibles at least 30 feet from any building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIRE STRESS AREAS 
</P>
<P>
 Map shows largely undeveloped land where dead brush and a lack of leaf 
moisture in live brush create high fire hazards. Fire officials say these are 
areas where blazes can start and expand rapidly, spreading from open land to 
homes and other structures. 
</P>
<P>
What You Can Do 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials have a number of recommendations for residents of areas where 
the wildfire danger is high: 
</P>
<P>
Clear brush and grass a minimum of 30 feet away from any buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Do not not store firewood, trash or other combustibles within 30 feet of any 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Do not smoke, barbecue or build a campfire outdoors until the rainy season 
resumes in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Do not drive motor vehicles in off-road areas where brush and grass grow. 
Exhaust sparks and hot mufflers start many wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
Do not use an indoor fireplace that is not equipped with a spark-arresting 
device. 
</P>
<P>
In case of fire, turn off all tap water unless instructed otherwise. 
Indiscriminate use of water can lower the pressure to those who need it to 
fight the blaze.

MEMO: TREE FARMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only about 1.2 million Christmas trees are grown in California each year, which 
represents about 25% of the statewide market for live trees, according to the 
California Christmas Tree Growers, a trade group based in Alamo. Oregon and 
Washington, by comparison, grow about 5 million trees each, and together supply 
about 25% to 30% of the nation's trees. 
</P>
<P>
The most common Christmas tree grown on California's choose-and-cut farms is 
the Monterey Pine, a native of California's Monterey Peninsula, according to 
the growers association. It isn't generally available on retail lots, according 
to industry sources. It has a deep green color, needles four to five inches 
long and a strong pine fragrance. Growers say it is a fast-growing tree that 
takes four to five years to reach harvest size and is among the longest-lasting 
trees when the stem is recut and the tree is kept in water. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular tree found on retail lots is the plantation-grown Douglas fir. 
Most sold in California come from the Pacific Northwest, but the tree also 
grows in the colder, moister regions of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-priced tree found on California retail lots is the Silvertip or Red 
fir, which grows only in high elevations and takes 12 or more years to reach 
harvest size. The species is available on choose-and-cut farms in the Sierras. 
</P>
<P>
The growers association projects an average tree price this season of $23.65, 
or about the same as last season. Some choose-and-cut farms charge by the foot 
-- in some cases about $5 per foot. Trees are available as tall as 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to pests, tree farms have to worry about thieves who sneak in a 
night and help themselves. Federal officials have come up with a creative 
deterrent to pilfering trees from public lands. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, trees have been sprayed with a compound that is odorless and 
colorless, but produces a horrible smell hours after the tree is cut. It smells 
"something like a reindeer that's been dead in the living room for a few 
weeks," said an official interviewed recently on National Public Radio's 
Morning Edition news program. LINDA WILLIAMS

The state Department of Food and Agriculture has begun releasing a breed of 
stingless wasps in Southern California to combat the devastating ash whitefly, 
officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County, however, has been excluded from the first wave of releases 
because of short supplies, said Peter Stoddard, a research scientist with the 
agriculture department's pest management branch. 
</P>
<P>
The wasps are harmless to humans but act as a biological control against the 
ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
The wasps are being bred in a UC Riverside greenhouse, but reproduction has 
been relatively slow, Stoddard said. Twelve counties from San Diego to Fresno 
are expected to see releases of small colonies of wasps before the summer is 
through. 
</P>
<P>
The ash whitefly was first detected two years ago by suburban homeowners in the 
eastern part of Ventura County where large shade trees have been attacked by 
the pesky insect. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny whitefly attacks a tree by sucking its sap. It produces a sticky fluid 
that coats cars, sidewalks and patio furniture. Left unchecked, the fly 
eventually kills all the leaves on the infested tree. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials say they are trying to stop the spread of the whitefly 
before it threatens commercial crops. PSYCHE PASCUAL

TORREY PINES IMPERILED BY BEETLE PESTS, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The gnarled but picturesque Torrey Pine tree, the rarest species of pine in the 
United States and a revered part of the coastal landscape just north of La 
Jolla, have been jealously guarded from human harm here like a jewel in a 
vault. 
</P>
<P>
But now the Torrey Pines that cling to a 4-mile stretch of sandstone bluffs 
face a new threat. Weakened by two years of drought and several days of hellish 
heat in late summer, they have been hit by a bark beetle infestation which, if 
unchecked, could seriously deplete the Torrey Pines State Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The pest, called the "confused five-spined beetle" because of the aimless path 
it bores under the bark of a tree, has already killed a dozen Torrey Pines at 
the 1,750-acre park and threatens to lay low more than 100 others. State 
officials worry that the problem could spread even further into the park's 
Torrey Pines population, estimated at 7,000 trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Concern 
</P>
<P>
"We're deeply concerned and a bit alarmed at the extent of the infestation," 
said Bob Wohl, supervising ranger at the reserve. "It's located in the heart of 
the park, the areas with the highest visibility and the most prominence." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the pines along the San Diego County coast, the trees exist in only 
one other place in the world -- on Santa Rosa Island, one of the chain of 
Channel Islands southwest of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
State parks officials are hopeful that rain will continue through the winter, 
bolstering the health of the pines and increasing the production of sap that 
typically wards off the pests. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the rain we've had since Thanksgiving Day and the tremendous drop in 
temperature will knock the beetles off," Wohl said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans for Counterattack 
</P>
<P>
If the pests are still prevalent by spring, however, authorities probably will 
begin a counterattack, even though park policy encourages a laissez faire 
management approach to help maintain the reserve's ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Tippets, a state park ecologist, said officials would probably begin by 
thinning out unhealthy trees. Bark on infested pines probably would be stripped 
to create an inhospitable environment for the beetles. If necessary, some of 
the affected pines might be cut up and hauled out of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities suspect that some weakened and fallen trees have served as 
incubators for the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Insecticides would be considered only as a last resort. Tippets said chemicals 
typically prove only partly successful and could potentially kill insects that 
may prey on pests like the beetle. 
</P>
<P>
The beetle, Ips paraconfusus, hardly looks like a feared invader. Less than a 
quarter-inch long, the insect has a dark brown body with tiny rounded antenna. 
The slow-moving, winged insect is capable of wandering among several trees 
during its lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effects of Insects 
</P>
<P>
It devours the cambium layer, the thin coat between the bark and inner hardwood 
that serves as the circulatory system for the tree, processing photosynthetic 
products as well as nutrients tapped from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
A male finds a susceptible tree -- typically one weakened by drought or aging 
-- and sends out a sex attractant that lures female beetles. Together, they 
hollow out a larval chamber in the tree where the female lays eggs. The hatched 
larva do most of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Clusters of needles that characterize the Torrey Pine begin to drop. If the 
larva circumnavigate the trunk, severing the cambium layer connecting roots and 
branches, the pine eventually will die. 
</P>
<P>
On a tour of the grove, Wohl pointed to a graying tree. Reaching up, he grabbed 
a small branch and with an easy twist pulled off a ring of bark, ready proof 
that the tree had been infested. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say what we're talking about here is a doomed tree," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems Noted 
</P>
<P>
Wohl said rangers first noticed problems in April, when the needles on several 
trees began to brown and drop off. The problems persisted through the summer 
and Wohl said several days of 100-degree temperatures produced a "blast furnace 
effect on the trees." 
</P>
<P>
By Labor Day, experts had isolated the beetles as the problem. In mid-December, 
a state forest pathologist conducted tests. He agreed that the drought had 
weakened the trees enough to allow the beetle infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Much like the battle between a human immunological system and foreign bodies, 
Torrey Pines fight a continuous war with the beetle and other pests. A healthy 
flow of sap serves to repel the invading hordes, pushing their eggs out or 
encasing an attacker in a coat of resin. 
</P>
<P>
"The bark beetles are always here, but the trees can normally repel them," Wohl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has spread to several of the most prominent spots in the park that 
feature some of the oldest and most beautiful pines, which can live about 300 
years. Beetles also have spread to several trees surrounding the park 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Given a New Name 
</P>
<P>
Once known as the Soledad Pine, the trees were renamed in 1850 by Dr. C.C. 
Parry, a botanist for the U.S. Mexican Boundary Survey. Parry chose the 
botanical name, Pinus torreyana or Torrey Pine, in honor of his former botany 
professor, Dr. John Torrey. 
</P>
<P>
In 1883, Parry returned to the site and began urging that the land be acquired 
to preserve the species from what he feared would be certain extinction at the 
hands of man. The City of San Diego designated 369 acres as a public park in 
1899. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Browning Scripps acquired adjacent groves in the years that followed, and 
those lands were added to the park in 1924, when it was enlarged to nearly 
1,000 acres. In 1979, a 154-acre extension area was formed on the sloping 
hillside to the north of Los Penasquitos Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous infestations. Most recently, bark beetles killed 18 
trees in 1984 and 1985. Eventually, rains helped bolster the surviving trees, 
and they repelled the beetles. 
</P>
<P>
Some authorities suggest that the Torrey Pines State Reserve's trees have been 
weakened not only by the recent drought, but by increased competition for water 
among the proliferating pines.

<LEADPARA>  MORE than one person is cursing "those damn eucalyptus" as the fuel that
ignited the Oakland hills tragedy. Officials in Berkeley are talking about
banning their planting.;   But thousands of eucalyptus trees grow in hilly
areas throughout the California coastal area. Planted in woodlots in the
1920s, the eucalyptus have gone wild, taking over hillsides and driving out
native plants, much to the dismay of naturalists, who have long opposed their
planting in California.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Alive or dead, drought or not, the trees are serious fire hazards.;   "Most
eucalyptus have highly flammable oil in the branches. They are designed to
burn hot and fast in such a way that the fruit opens and the seeds are
released without burning. That is the way they've evolved and that is why they
keep coming back," says Brett Hall, manager at the University of California,
Santa Cruz, arboretum, where dozens of eucalyptus species are cultivated.;  
Because of the way they grow, getting rid of eucalyptus would be a major job.
Reseeding is just part of the problem. When eucalyptus is cut down, it puts up
new shoots from the stump or roots, which in turn develop into new, full-size
trees in less than 10 years.;   Hall says a drought-stressed eucalyptus "burns
almost as fast and hot as a dead eucalyptus. It's that flammable. The branches
are pure fuel.";   The irony is that eucalyptus is valued as excellent
firewood because it burns at a high temperature and produces a lot of heat.;  
The Blue Gum is the story of a California dream gone awry. The trees where
brought here from Australia in the 1920s as a source for timber. A bad idea,
it turned out, because the wood was too brittle for lumber use.;   But by
then, those first stands of fast-growing trees were spreading seed throughout
the coastal area of California. Now the Blue Gum of the species Eucalyptus
globulus is the most widely grown eucalyptus in the state. There are some 800
species of eucalyptus, and Sunset Western Garden Book lists 57 types for use
in California landscapes.;   Hall is unhappy that the Blue Gum "has given all
eucalyptus a bad name because of the fire.";   Shrub eucalyptus are attractive
to butterflies, bees and birds. In fact, most of the Central Coast's monarch
butterfly population is in partial eucalyptus groves. Small tree varieties,
and shrub types, are used as wind breaks and screens, and some are valued for
their attractive bark and flowers.;   But even Sunset cautions that the Blue
Gum is too messy, greedy and brittle for yard or city use, noting, "They need
deep roots and plenty of room and are best on coastal slopes.";   Which is
just where they were when the wind, blowing from the East, began fanning
Sunday's fire. It was then that their sap began to boil, forcing whole trees
to explode in one big whoosh.  </TEXT>

state that they have nearly the clout of natives. Just try to cut down one,
let alone a grove -- you'll find defenders who couldn't be bothered with a
scrub oak or a stand of madrone.;    Eucalyptus is native to Australia.
Several hundred species grow down under in a variety of soils and habitats --
just about everywhere between the heart of the rain forests and the deserts

<TEXT>     The first eucalypts in California were planted in a San Francisco garden
around 1853. Over the next decade a handful were planted here, a handful
there. Meanwhile a California educator became convinced that the deforestation
of the United States was imminent. With a fitting 19th century optimism,
Elwood Cooper believed there was a man-made solution to this problem.;    On a
ranch north of Santa Barbara he planted 50,000 eucalypts and began to spread
the word.;    What ensued was described as "The Eucalyptus Crusade" by Viola
Lockhart Warren in Southern California Quarterly: "With the naive mixture of
patriotism and acquisitiveness that Ellwood Cooper had inspired, Southern
California began to plant. . . . Cooper had recommended windbreaks planted at
right angles with the prevailing direction of the wind, and windbreaks were
planted. Cooper wanted the highways lined with trees, closely planted and two
or three rows deep, and the inspired landholders edged their property with
belts of little seedlings and watered them carefully for the first year.";   
The crusade hit warp speed after the Forest Service predicted that U.S.
eastern hardwoods would be cut and gone by 1920. Visions of gold eagles danced
in growers' heads, fueled by testimonials from furniture makers, flooring
firms, dry-dock builders -- and that didn't count the byproducts that could be
distilled from the oil and resin.;    The first trees harvested had problems
-- the wood had to be sawn into lumber right away, before it became unworkable
-- but these were thought to be speed bumps. They turned out to be brick
walls. It didn't matter how the wood was cut, or when, or what was done to it
after: It warped, it cracked, it twisted.;    Other drawbacks began to
surface. The roots were as invasive as Saddam Hussein, breaking cisterns and
water pipes as they burrowed for water. As a street tree, eucalypts were a
bust. After any good windstorm you'll still see lanes blocked by leaves, bark,
branches and, in a good season, whole trees. They crack and fall no matter how
well you're tending to them in good times, let alone the conditions that have
freeze-dried so many of them recently.;    Good riddance, you might say.
(Especially if a previous lord of your manor planted one in your back yard.)
And yet, and yet. . . . Woodman, spare that tree! We need the scent, if
nothing else. No one who has walked through a stand of eucalyptus, perhaps
early in the fall when the scimitar leaves have absorbed a summer's worth of
heat, can forget that aroma, or wish never to smell it again.;    They came to
California to take it over, but were humbled by their limitations, the way a
lot of us are. They're good citizens -- new to the neighborhood but learning
its ways. Indeed, a windbreak of these immigrants might tame the odoriferous
wind that threatens a South Bay baseball stadium. "If you mix eucalyptus and
chlorine," says the official stadium odor consultant, "you smell eucalyptus."
And so the team that took the field would have to be not the San Francisco
Giants, not the San Jose Giants, but the Eucalyptus Giants.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Large groups of pines and firs are being killed by the western pine beetle,
mountain pine beetle and fir engraver beetle. The mortality is thought to
result from the drought, which has weakened the trees so that the beetles can
successfully overcome the defense systems of the trees.;    Several other
researchers are developing a computer data bank to help county directors in UC
Cooperative Extension offices around the state to obtain tree diagnoses,
evaluate potential damage and receive treatment options.;  IF YOU'RE

   A year after one of the worst summer fire seasons
this century for the nation's forests, government and timber
industry officials are worried the drought may be bringing even
more devastating conditions.
   In some parts, ``the conditions we are experiencing now are very
similar to what we would expect to be experiencing in August, at
the height of the fire season,'' said Paul Weeden, a U.S. Forest
Service emergency operations specialist in Washington, D.C.
   Although there are ``pockets of wetness'' in some forests,
Weeden said Wednesday, most of the nation has a high fire danger,
with some areas facing very high or extreme risks. Many areas are
in their second year or more of drought, he said, with the
hardest-hit areas in the Pacific Northwest, California and parts of
the Southeast, particularly North Carolina.
   The dry weather also wilts tree seedlings, slows growth and
makes trees more susceptible to insects, especially bark beetles,
Weeden said.
   If dry conditions continue for another month, an estimated 5.7
billion board feet of timber could be lost to the quarter-inch
beetles, which eat the cambium between the tree's bark and wood, he
said.
   ``That's a pretty significant number because the average annual
allowable cut for the Forest Service is about 11 billion board
feet,'' he said.
   Weyerhaeuser Co. expects to lose 15 percent of its 38 million
seedlings in the South because of the drought, said John McMahon,
vice president of timberlands. Last year, McMahon told The Wall
Street Journal in an article published Wednesday, Weyerhaeuser had
to replant 4 percent of its seedlings nationwide.
   Fire is the most immediate threat to the nation's dry forests.
   Last year, fires burned almost 5 million acres of government and
private timber, worth $1.2 billion, Weeden said. It was the worst
fire year for federal lands since 1919.
   One of the largest fires so far this year burned 58,300 acres of
parched timber and grasslands in and near the Custer National
Forest along the Montana-South Dakota border. Firefighters brought
it under control Wednesday.
   In Wyoming, erratic winds hindered 389 firefighters trying to
control a 1,150-acre fire that was sparked by lightning and
threatened critical grizzly bear and bald eagle habitat in the
Shoshone National Forest.
   And Southern California firefighters battled two Riverside
County brush fires that charred 1,125 acres. Authorities hoped to
encircle the largest blaze, 1,000 acres, by tonight.
   Nearly 800,000 acres of California timberland were lost to fire
last year, and officials are edgy. Even though the state's forests
got some rain recently, ``We're still in extreme danger,'' said
Roberta Andersen, vice president of the Timber Association of
California in Sacramento.
   ``The fire season started real early,'' said Brian Barrette,
staff chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection. ``It was running at least six weeks ahead of normal.''
   Temperatures cooled in May, but not enough to affect the
dried-out trees in many California forests, Barrette said. With a
30- to 60-day outlook for above-normal temperatures, ``it's a
pretty good indication that we'll have some real problems,'' he
said.
   In the Northwest, the Cascade Mountains divide the fire danger:
On the wetter west side, conditions are about normal, but to the
east, forests are facing a fourth consecutive dry year.
   ``There was no significant rain this spring. The little bit of
rain we did get gave us good growths of grasses and brush that are
beginning to dry out,'' said Marty Ames, spokeswoman for the
Wenatchee National Forest in central Washington. ``It doesn't look
like the weather is going to bring any relief.''

'NO QUICK FIX' SEEN IN BATTLING GROWING SWARMS OF ASH WHITEFLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Agriculture officials and entomologists said Friday that there is "no quick 
fix" to countering the growing swarms of ash whiteflies in Orange County and 
other parts of Southern California, but the pesky insects could eventually be 
controlled through predators and parasites. 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the California Agricultural Commissioners and Sealers Assn. 
subcommittee on the ash whitefly in Anaheim, Orange County Agricultural 
Commissioner James D. Harnett urged tormented homeowners not to spray 
pesticides in an attempt to kill the flies that have recently infested their 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't work very well and it's not a good idea," Harnett told reporters 
after the meeting Friday. "There is no quick fix. It is a matter of controlling 
the flies, not eradication." 
</P>
<P>
Harnett said he understands why residents in Southern California are upset with 
the infestation of the flying insect, which is about the size of the head of a 
pin. The flies are so numerous in places that people can no longer hold 
gatherings in their back yards, Harnett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduction Expected 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, the ash whitefly will never be eradicated completely, and 
residents should get used to it. Harnett said that when control programs are 
under way the number of the flies will be reduced considerably. 
</P>
<P>
The fly hangs on the underside of the leaves of ash trees and ornamental pear 
trees. There it eats the leaves and lays its eggs. Although the insect was 
spotted for the first time only last year, Harnett said September and October 
seem to be the worst months for the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bellows, UC Riverside associate professor of entomology, said officials 
are studying predators and parasites that are successfully used in Europe and 
Israel to control the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
One of the predators, similar to the orange lady bug but small and bronze 
colored, eats the ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of next year, Bellows said he hoped to be ready to release 
whatever predators or parasites that will control the pest and yet not pose a 
danger to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bellows advised residents to keep the trees that the whiteflies 
infest well watered and be prepared for the leaves to drop off a little sooner 
than usual.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS PROPOSITION 130; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCIAL TRIES TO SHOW SUPPORT IS MAINSTREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of Proposition 130, designed to save California's forests from 
logging, began their advertising campaign Wednesday with a commercial intended 
to show mainstream support for the forestry measure. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second television commercial, which will be aired through Sept. 30 in 
most major media markets, shows a fresh-faced state park ranger in a Smokey 
Bear hat strolling through a grove of trees and bemoaning the loss of giant 
redwoods. The ranger notes that the California State Park Rangers Assn., the 
Audubon Society and the Sierra Club support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial comes at a time when opponents are linking the measure to the 
radical Earth First! environmental group in radio commercials. The group is not 
a sponsor of Proposition 130, although members of Earth First! may support it 
and were hired along with others to circulate petitions to qualify it for the 
Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no involvement with Earth First! whatsoever," said Proposition 130 
spokesman Steven Glacier, accusing opponents of a "smear tactic. . . . We are 
backed by mainstream groups. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 130 would ban clear-cutting on all timberlands statewide. It 
defines clear-cutting as the removal at one time of 60% or more of trees from 
2.5 acres or more, or, in the Sierra Nevada, from five acres or more. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost all of the cutting that is done in California now could be called a 
clear-cut under that definition," said Ross Johnson, chief of forest practice 
regulation for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would put environmentalists on a state forestry board that 
decides appeals to logging plans. Environmental groups charge that the 
governor-appointed board now is dominated by supporters of the logging 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 138, a countermeasure put forth by the forest products industry, 
would ban clear-cutting only of old-growth or ancient forests and reduce by 50% 
clear-cutting in other forests. 
</P>
<P>
But the countermeasure defines clear-cutting differently from Proposition 130. 
Johnson said Proposition 138 follows the state's definition, meaning that all 
but about six sizable trees could be removed from an acre. 
</P>
<P>
In the commercial for Proposition 130, the park ranger notes that only 5% of 
the state's ancient redwoods remain. According to the state forestry 
department, California still has about 1.6 million acres of redwood forests, 
but about 95% of them have been cut down at least once or twice. Some species 
of wildlife depend on virgin forests for survival. 
</P>
<P>
Although the television commercial may reassure voters that the initiative does 
not represent merely the views of an extremist group, the ad also provides the 
opposition with another opportunity to criticize the involvement of a San Mateo 
financial adviser in the anti-logging effort. 
</P>
<P>
As required by law, backers of Proposition 130 note that funding for the ad 
came from H.L. Arbit, as well as from environmental groups. Opponents claim 
that Harold Arbit, the financial adviser, has major holdings in timber and 
paper companies that primarily do business outside California and hence would 
profit by Proposition 130's passage. Forestry workers and their families staged 
a demonstration in front of the Pacific Stock Exchange on Tuesday to protest 
what they said would be huge profits for Arbit if the measure passed. 
</P>
<P>
Arbit, however, says he contributed $940,000 to the measure because of 
long-held concerns about logging practices and not for personal financial gain. 
He says he personally owns no stocks and maintains that timber stocks he bought 
for his clients represent a tiny fraction, about one-fifteenth, of their 
portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to changing logging practices, Proposition 130 would authorize $742 
million in state general obligation bonds to purchase remaining ancient forests 
and save them from logging. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents contend that the measure would reduce logging by 70% and eliminate 
75,000 jobs in California. Supporters argue that it will increase timber 
harvests over the long term because it requires loggers to save more of the 
forest land now.

<LEADPARA>  A GROUP dedicated to saving the disappearing oaks that once spread their huge
canopies throughout the Central Valley celebrated the first California Native
Oak Day by planting a spindly, eight-foot valley oak in Capitol Park.;  
"Tremendous numbers of these trees existed at one time in California," said
Sen. Dan McCorquodale, D-San Jose, author of the resolution passed by the
Legislature naming Nov. 1 as California Native Oak Day.  </LEADPARA>

A HOPEFUL MOVE TO PRESERVE OAKS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Update  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "It is easy to cut a tree. It is very difficult to grow a tree,
particularly an oak tree," said Jane Hagedorn, founder of the California Oak
Foundation.;   Hagedorn, McCorquodale and other foundation members grinned as
they used a gold-plated ceremonial shovel to toss dirt into the hole
surrounding the young tree.;   Hagedorn, former president of the Sacramento
Tree Foundation, and other civil leaders, conservationists and arborists
formed the California Oak Foundation in 1988. She said it was started "knowing
we were losing this precious heritage and there was no one out there to be an
advocate for it.";   California has 15 species of oak, including several
native only to the state. The trees once dominated the Central Valley, their
acorns providing food for California Indians. But many species, particularly
valley oak, blue oak and Engelmann oak, have been greatly diminished by
large-scale clearing for development, farming and flood control.;  
McCorquodale said when the Senate Natural Resources Committee, which he
chairs, held a hearing on the oak several years ago, "it seemed there were
more symbols of oak trees than there were oak trees." He said firms were using
the oak as a symbol and cities used the tree in names, but no one was doing
anything to preserve the trees.;   The foundation now has more than 2,000
members and "I am cautiously optimistic that we will save this resource for
our children," Hagedorn said.;   The foundation's goal is to improve public
knowledge of oaks and promote both saving existing trees and planting new
ones.;   The foundation is publishing a new book, "Oaks of California" by
Bruce Pavlik, Pam Muick and Sharon Johnson, next month. It also has a pamphlet
called "Compatible Plants Under and Around Oaks," and a brochure suggesting
oak-related classroom projects called "Seed to Seedling."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  CALIFORNIA; STATE; TREE; REGULATION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The state Department of Forestry intends to come up with a new plan to
restrict the harvest of immature trees in coastal Northern California, despite
the state Board of Forestry's refusal Tuesday to declare an emergency and
limit the harvest.;    The board, an industry-dominated panel made up entirely
of appointees of former Gov. George Deukmejian, concluded that the rapid
harvest of redwoods and other trees in recent years does not threaten the
long-term supply of timber in California.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  STATE LOOKS AT NEW LOGGING RESTRICTIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, alarmed by an
increasing number of industry proposals to log immature stands of trees, had
asked the board to approve emergency regulations restricting the size of trees
that loggers could cut. But the board voted 6-0 to reject the proposal.;    On
Wednesday, Ken Delfino, the Forestry Department's deputy director for
resources, said he will return to the board with regulations that are similar
but would be implemented on the regular state timetable for adopting rules
rather than the streamlined schedule that requires declaration of an
emergency.;    With the defeat of two rival timber initiatives on the ballot
last year, the issue of over-cutting has emerged as one of the major questions
facing Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature. The governor, who oversees the
Forestry Department, has called for a policy of sustained yield, in which the
timber harvest does not exceed the forests' annual growth rate.;    At the
same time, a group of Northern California lawmakers has pledged to push
through the Legislature a compromise drafted by environmentalists and one
timber company that would place a variety of new restrictions on the logging
industry.;    But Wilson missed an opportunity to promote the emergency
regulations: Since January, the Board of Forestry has had three vacancies,
including the post of chairman, and the governor has yet to fill any of the
seats. Spokesmen for Wilson said he has been too preoccupied with the state's
budget deficit and drought to focus on the appointments.;    For years, the
timber industry has been under pressure from environmentalists to halt logging
of old-growth trees. More recently, industry critics have protested that
loggers are taking trees that are less than 50 years old and have not yet
reached their period of most rapid growth.;    The emergency regulations
proposed by the department would have affected about 1.4 million acres of
immature forest, more than half of the timberland on the North Coast,
department officials said.;    Dozens of landowners and industry
representatives vigorously opposed the proposed logging restrictions.;   
"What business does the state have in dictating when a landowner should
harvest his crop?" argued Jim Holmes, a forester with Simpson Lumber Co.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  One of California's largest timber companies, Louisiana-Pacific Corp., said
Wednesday it would phase out clear-cutting on company-owned land in the
state.;    In a statement from the company's Portland headquarters, Chairman
Harry Merlo said clear-cutting -- the controversial practice of removing all
the trees in an area -- wasn't bad for forests, but was bad for public
relations.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TIMBER GIANT VOWS TO END CLEAR-CUTTING ON
ITS LAND  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News wire services contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "It comes under frequent criticism for the way it looks for the first
several years following a harvest," Merlo said.;    The promise to stop
clear-cutting by 1994 comes four months after California voters narrowly
defeated a sweeping forestry-reform initiative that would have banned
clear-cutting. Referring specifically to the defeated Proposition 130, Merlo
said the company was responding to "genuine interest and concern in California
about how trees are grown, harvested and converted into products.";    But
skeptical environmentalists noted that Louisiana-Pacific traditionally uses
little clear-cutting. They suggested the announcement was timed to head off
forestry-reform efforts in the Legislature and potentially restrictive rules
from the state Board of Forestry.;    "We're not impressed," said Gary Ball,
president of the Mendocino Environment Center, where Louisiana-Pacific owns
most of its 500,000 acres in California. He said the company would continue to
use "shelterwood" cuts, which he described as "a clear-cut done in stages.";  
 Environmentalists complain that clear-cutting is visually unattractive,
contributes to erosion and distorts natural processes, because all the trees
in an area are rarely felled by fires or storms.;    Representatives of other
environmental groups were more favorable. "This is a large, bold step in the
proper direction," said Gail Lucas, head of the Sierra Club's forest-practices
task force.;    However, Lucas said the announcement did little to resolve
concerns about the rate at which trees are being cut along the North Coast, or
Louisiana-Pacific's plan to convert most of its redwood and Douglas firs to
young trees that would be broken down and recombined into "wood products.";   
Lucas is one of three environmentalists who have been meeting with
representatives of Sierra Pacific Co. in hopes of developing a forestry-reform
package -- addressing the same issues but less severely than Proposition 130
-- for the Legislature. The proposal could face opposition from more radical
environmentalists and other timber companies, however.;    Wednesday, other
major timber companies -- including Georgia-Pacific Corp. and Simpson Redwood
Co. -- said they did not plan to eliminate clear-cutting.;   
Louisiana-Pacific, which does not use clear-cutting outside California, said
it would continue to clear-cut in national forests, where the harvesting
method is determined by the U.S. Forest Service.;    Combined with reduced
timber sales in national forests and cutting restrictions to protect the
endangered Northern spotted owl, Merlo said the elimination of clear-cutting
would reduce Louisiana-Pacific's California harvests by 40 percent.  </TEXT>

   Florida's agriculture commissioner announced
Tuesday the state will begin aerial pesticide spraying to combat an
infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies.
   A malathion compound will be sprayed by helicopter beginning
Thursday in a mostly residential, 16-square-mile area, commissioner
Doyle Conner said at a news conference.
   The spraying will continue for four weeks followed by the
release of millions of sterile Medflies over a 75-day period to
break the breeding cycle. Fruit quarantine boundaries have not yet
been established.
   Six of the crop-destroying pests have been discovered near Miami
International Airport, including two on Tuesday.
   Conner said the eradication program has proven successful and is
the best approach, despite environmental concerns raised over
similar sprayings in California.
   Consumer activists and local governments in Southern California
have protested the repeated spraying of malathion-laced syrup on
suburban neighborhoods. The Medfly has spread from suburban back
yards to orange and grapefruit groves in some of the region's
richest farmland.
   ``Those who advocate deviating from accepted scientific
procedures, you run into the grave risk of getting into the
predicament California is in,'' Conner said. ``We don't want to
stay in this program a day longer than necessary.''
   Bobby McKown, executive vice president of Florida Citrus Mutual
in Lakeland, said Monday the 12,000-member growers' organization
supports ``immediate action to control and eradicate the Medflies
so they don't expand beyond residential areas.''
   Medflies, considered one of the world's most serious
agricultural pests, are about half the size of houseflies. They do
not sting and pose no threat to humans, but the larvae hatching
inside more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables can turn it
to inedible mush.
   Conner said the 2.4 ounces of malathion to be sprayed per acre
with a syrupy insect food bait posed no health risk, but an
environmentalist blasted the announcement.
   ``The bad thing about using these kinds of chemicals is that
they wipe out all the insects in an area _ the good and the bad,''
said Lee Emerson, vice president of the environment group Friends
of the Oleta River.
   It's not the kind of balanced, environmentally sensitive
approach we should be taking these days,'' he said.
   The zone to be sprayed covers suburban Miami Springs, Virginia
Gardens, part of Hialeah and unincorporated areas northwest of
downtown Miami. The latest fly was found Tuesday in Virginia
Gardens.
   The Florida Medfly Advisory Group, which includes Medfly experts
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, expanded the area of
intensive trapping Monday from 81 to 106 square miles and beefed up
the inspection staff.
   Traps were set in fruit trees by state agricultural inspectors
around Dade County following the discovery April 16 of a lone male
Medfly near the airport. Two more males were found last weekend in
sour-orange trees in Miami Springs and Hialeah, and one female in a
calamondin tree in Miami Springs.
   Some 60,000 gallons of malathion in a stronger concentration,
about 3.1 ounces per acre, are used annually throughout Florida for
mosquito control.
   The last Medfly infestation in South Florida was in 1987 when
five males were found in Hialeah. The last major outbreak to affect
Florida's commercial groves spread across 28 counties in 1956.

<LEADPARA>  Walking or driving around the West Valley you might not be able to see the
forest for the trees. But it's there -- a huge urban forest.;    And bad
things have entered that forest -- drought, disease and freezing temperatures.
As a result the trees, sometimes called the "lungs of a city" because of their
oxygen-producing capabilities, are wheezing.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The general health is weakened. No question about it," said Bob Bryant,
director of parks, forestry and maintenance for the town of Los Gatos. "It's
the worst I've experienced in 25 years.";    Already stressed by drought and
then punched with a chilly fist last December and January, a large number of
trees could be dead or dying. The extent of the damage won't be known until
the spring.;    "My recommendation is not to do a thing until April to see
what kind of budding and new growth we get and then we will know what trees to
prune and save and what trees will have to be removed," said Bryant.;    The
town has already applied for $130,000 from the state's Natural Disaster
Assistance Act to fund the replanting of trees. That amount would be necessary
if all the town-owned trees that are damaged die, according to Bryant,
representing what he terms a "worse case scenario.";    Officials in all the
West Valley communities say the problem with city-owned trees hasn't yet
become a huge one, but they add that more trees than usual are having to be
removed and that their normal growth patterns are being affected.;    No more
than six to 10 trees have to be removed in a normal year in Campbell. This
season the total is already more than 20.;    Tree removals represent an
extremely small proportion of the thousands of city-owned trees which line the
streets and are in city parks, and the thousands more on private property. But
the aesthetic and environmental qualities of trees make them a priority
concern of both city officials and homeowners. Brown lawns are one thing.
Losing trees that took maybe 50 years to mature is another.;    How much more
serious the problem might become depends on how many trees end up dead or
unsalvageable, coupled with budgetary constraints and whatever water
allocations are available later this year.;    "We'll have to move our water
resources around, but basically the way I'm viewing it is that ground- cover
turf can be easily replaced, but a tree is a 20-, 30- or 50-year investment,"
said Mike DeGroot, Campbell public works superintendent.;    Last summer, the
city stored non-potable (non-drinkable) water secured from the San Jose Water
Treatment Plant and used a city water truck to irrigate critical areas.;   
Most of the trees Campbell plants are Chinese pistachio, Raywood Ash, Bradford
Pear, and flowering plum. The city this season has already lost quite a few
young eucalyptus, some ficus, ash and evergreen pear trees, according to
DeGroot.;    Monterey pines, which dot its hillsides, have proven to be the
biggest problem in Saratoga. The drought-weakened trees are infested with bark
beetles.;    "Monterey pines have been planted extensively on hillsides,
primarily on private property, and a number of them have had to be removed,"
said Bob Rizzo, Saratoga parks superintendent. "There are also a lot of
eucalyptus and California pepper trees I've noticed looking real bad.";    It
was reported last summer that the bark beetle infestation had become
widespread in San Jose, affecting dozens of trees in older parks and
neighborhoods. Particularly hard hit were Rainbow Park in West San Jose and
Butcher Park in the Cambrian area.;    Rizzo said oaks and other
drought-resistant trees are doing fairly well and there isn't a large problem
with city-owned trees in Saratoga. That could change if the drought
continues.;    Riparian trees, those along lakes and creekbeds, have been
stressed as their root systems struggle in dry and compacted soil.;    The
white alders at Vasona Park in Los Gatos have been hard hit, as have
eucalyptus. "I suspect the Australian willow has been badly burned in the
freeze," said Bryant.;    Removing and replanting trees is a big expense for
municipalities. Likewise, homeowners could be faced with large bills dealing
with the trees on their property.;    "Those folks could be in a world of
hurt," said Bryant.  </TEXT>
