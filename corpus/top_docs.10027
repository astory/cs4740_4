controversial milk-boosting hormone bovine somatotrophin (BST) for cows
until the end of the decade following widespread resistance to the product.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, was alone in voting in favour
of the synthetic hormone, despite strong consumer opposition to its use in
Britain.
BST, which is produced by Monsanto and Eli Lilley, the US biotechnology
companies, is an artificial version of a naturally occurring hormone in cows
which enhances milk output.
Mr Waldegrave said scientific evidence supported the use of BST. Consumers
and animal welfare activists are concerned about its effects, including an
increase in the incidence of mastitis in cows.
There was some confusion over the wording of the Council of Agriculture
Ministers' final decision on BST. Monsanto said the council had agreed that
some farmers could make limited commercial use of the hormone in order to
gain practical experience of its effects. UK government officials said this
would be restricted to field trials.
The product received approval in the US six months ago and since then it has
been used by 10,000 dairy farmers on more than 800,000 cows, Monsanto said.
The European Commission was concerned about the economic damage that could
be done by increasing milk output at a time when quotas are in place to
limit production. The ban on its use will now last until the milk quota
restriction runs out at the end of 1999.
The commission has agreed to prepare a report on further scientific trials
by 1998. Consumer groups have called on the commission to prevent any milk
produced as part of the trials from entering the food chain.
Monsanto said there was no reason why milk produced using BST should not be
sold to consumers. The company produces BST near Vienna and Eli Lilley has a
production site outside Manchester.

   BRUSSELS


THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday agreed a report on Bovine Somatotrophin
(BST) that brought to the forefront its concerns that the growth hormone
would run counter to its efforts to reduce farm output.
The interim report follows last month's endorsement by the council of
ministers of a further, two-year moratorium on licensing the hormone, which
boosts the output of dairy cows by between 12 and 25 per cent, according to
different studies.
The report and the council decision together amount to 'a clear signal that
chemically based production improvements are not likely to be a feature of
the future', a commission official said. This is a blow to Monsanto and Eli
Lilly, the two companies seeking authorisation for hormones they have
developed, which some analysts believe could create a Dollars 1bn market
worldwide.
The commission report accepts that BST has no discernible effect on humans
who consume milk and dairy products from cows treated with it. The hormone
meets 'quality' and 'efficacy' criteria as well, though there is an animal
welfare consideration because the need to inject it daily causes swelling
and mastitis.
But the report notes that 'a veterinary medicinal product may not be
authorised. . . if its use would contravene the rules and objectives laid
down by the community within the framework of the common agricultural
policy'.
Plans to overhaul the CAP envisage sharp price and output cuts, to deal with
overproduction, which in the dairy sector is running at 15 per cent, despite
the use of ever more restrictive quotas. Widespread use of growth hormones
would drive a coach and horses through this strategy.

hormone for cows takes a new turn today with three UK scientists accusing
the manufacturer of seeking to suppress research pointing to adverse effects
on the health of cows.
Writing in the weekly scientific journal Nature, the scientists say that
Monsanto, the US biotechnology company, provided them with results of trials
on the incidence of mastitis in cows treated with the hormone, but refused
to let them publish their analyses of the data.
European Union agriculture ministers are due to decide at the end of the
year whether to lift a ban on the use of bovine somatotrophin (BST).
The hormone, an artificially produced version of one that occurs naturally
in cows, increases milk output by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent.
It went on sale in the US in February, but has met opposition from consumer
and animal welfare groups in Europe and from the European Commission, which
says that milk is already in surplus.
The scientists say they pooled the results of eight trials by Monsanto. They
found that BST treatment produced an average 19 per cent increase in the
somatic cell count - associated with an increased risk of mastitis - which
was highly unlikely to be due to chance.
Their request for publication in a veterinary journal was refused by
Monsanto's office in Brussels in 1991 and 1992 on the basis that the raw
material, and any subsequent analysis of it, was confidential, the authors
say.
'Our paper simply seeks to make public results that Monsanto appears to be
making little effort to publicise and that we believe are of importance to
the debate over the licensing of BST,' they say.
The scientists say specialists on intellectual property rights have told
them they are entitled to publish their analyses provided acknowledgement of
the sources is made, which they are happy to do.
Mr Tom McDermott, director of biotechnology communications at Monsanto,
said: 'The assertion (by the authors) that they were somehow entitled to
publish their analyses of other scientists' work, without approval or
acknowledgement, is indefensible.'

THE European Commission said yesterday that approval for the milk-boosting
dairy hormone bovine somatotrophin (BST) in the US would not affect its
plans to extend its ban on the drug.
The Food and Drug Administration in Washington last week approved the BST
drug, Sometribove, manufactured by Monsanto, which will be marketed under
the name Posilac.
Monsanto has spent Dollars 500m developing the drug, which increases milk
output by 6-20 per cent by supplementing the cow's natural BST hormone.
A spokesman for the Commission said there was 'no reason to change' its
plans to extend a four-year ban on BST for a further seven years.
The Commission proposed the extension in the summer on socio-economic and
environmental grounds, saying that use of BST would concentrate milk
production on larger farms, driving smaller producers out of business.
It would encourage the sort of overproduction that the Common Agricultural
Policy reforms were designed to cut, increasing slaughterings of dairy cows.
Commission surveys had shown it would also encounter resistance from
consumers.
The spokesman said the ban was unlikely to lead to the sort of trade war
with the US that was triggered by the EC ban on hormones in beef production
since 'we don't import dairy products from there'.
The entry of BST on to the US market is expected to cost the US government
Dollars 15m in payments to buy up excess supplies of milk from dairy
farmers.
The FDA said milk from treated cows had been found to have the same
nutritional value and composition as milk from untreated cows. 'The public
can be confident that milk and meat from BST-treated cows is safe to
consume,' said FDA commissioner David Kessler.
The agency said Monsanto had agreed to monitor BST residues and carry out
tests on milk produced in 21 leading dairy states for the next two years.

Monsanto, manufacturer of the milk-boosting dairy hormone BST, yesterday
sought to counter fears about its use, saying it had not cut milk
consumption and was reaping dividends for farmers.
BST, or bovine somatotrophin, is a manufactured version of a hormone that
occurs naturally in cows. Monsanto, which is reported to have spent about
Dollars 500m developing BST, began selling it in the US in February after
receiving approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
European Union agriculture ministers are due to consider in December whether
to lift a moratorium on its use in Europe. The European Commission, while
accepting BST is safe for humans, argues that artificially boosting milk
supplies runs counter to EU policy of cutting production.
In Britain, the government's adviser on animal welfare, the Farm Animal
Welfare Council, last week recommended that the hormone should not be
licensed until data were available on a wide range of issues relating to the
welfare of cows.
It said dairy cows treated with BST to induce a high yield were more prone
to mastitis, although it was not known whether the cause was BST or the milk
yield itself.
Ms Lisa Watson, Monsanto's health and consumer affairs manager, said a study
to be published in the US Journal of Dairy Science concludes that 'BST
doesn't affect the relationship between milk yield and the risk of
mastitis.'
During a visit to the UK to promote the hormone, she agreed there was a link
between high milk yield and mastitis but said other factors such as wet
weather and the stage of a cow's lactation had a 'five to 10 times greater
impact on whether a cow gets mastitis.'
Ms Watson also pointed to figures from the US Department of Agriculture
showing consumption of liquid milk was unchanged between February and April
compared with the same period last year.
This was despite the fact that 70 per cent of consumers were aware of BST,
up from around 28 per cent last November. However, only a tiny proportion of
milk is labelled as being produced without BST, so most consumers are
unlikely to have a choice about whether to buy BST-produced milk.
Conscious of milk quotas in Europe, Monsanto was anxious to sell the hormone
as 'a management tool' to help farmers meet their quotas despite output
problems caused by weather or illness, rather than as a way of increasing
milk supplies.
Monsanto's BST customers control about 20 per cent of milk production in the
US, the company says. Contrary to fears that BST could serve large,
efficient farmers to the detriment of smaller ones, the company says more
than half its customers are farmers with 100 or fewer cows.
Mr Jerry Steiner, marketing director, said farmers were getting a return of
Dollars 2 for every Dollars 1 they invested in BST, although some of that
would be absorbed by increased feed costs. 'We have a better than 90 per
cent satisfaction and repurchase rating from our customers,' he said.
Monsanto expects cows injected with BST to produce 10-15 per cent more milk
during their 300-day lactation, although the hormone is used only when
lactation is starting to decline.
The USDA has forecast that about 40 per cent of cows in the US would be
treated with BST by 2000. 'US farmers have a significant advantage in
reducing the cost of producing milk,' said Mr Steiner. 'Farmers in the UK
should have the opportunity for that same advantage.'

Retailers, consumers, farming organisations and animal welfare groups have
come out strongly against the licensing in Britain of a hormone that boosts
milk production in cows.
More than 100 companies, organisations and individuals responded to a
government consultation paper, with 62 expressing concern about bovine
somatotrophin, or BST. Twenty-one favoured licensing it, including the BST
manufacturers Monsanto and Lilly Industries, and the rest expressed no firm
opinion.
BST, an artificially produced version of a hormone that occurs naturally in
cows, went on sale to farmers in the US in February after approval from the
Food and Drug Administration last November.
European Union agriculture ministers are due to decide in December whether a
ban on its use should be lifted or remain in place until the year 2000.
Britain is believed to have been in a minority of two in wanting the ban
lifted when the 12 ministers discussed the issue last December. Germany is
thought to have favoured an indefinite ban, while most countries wanted a
moratorium until the end of the decade.
Although the hormone has met EU and UK licensing criteria of safety, quality
and efficacy, much of the opposition to it is based on fears of a consumer
backlash.
Monsanto last month cited figures from the US Department of Agriculture
showing liquid milk consumption in the US had remained steady since BST was
introduced.
However, the British Retail Consortium said in its submission that 'consumer
concern about BST has reached such a pitch that most, if not all retailers,
would like to be able to guarantee that their products do not come from cows
treated with it'.
Safeway, the supermarket group, said that if BST went on sale it would seek
supplies 'only from non-treated herds for milk and milk products for our
own-brand products'.
Pressure on Mrs Angela Browning, the new food minister, came in a letter
opposing BST from the Conservative party association in her Devon
constituency. In the event of licensing, it insisted on labelling to
distinguish milk produced with BST, saying: 'It is one of the government's
main planks of policy that consumers have the right of choice in a free
market.'
In spite of the generally accepted view that BST-produced milk is safe for
humans, some groups expressed concern about the increased presence of a
growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1).
In a letter last month to The Lancet, the medical journal, four medical
scientists wrote that 'the safety of BST-milk has not been established with
adequate scientific rigour, because of possible adverse effects of
substantially increased concentrations of IGF1 in the milk of BST-treated
cows'. They said evidence was needed about the action on human gut tissue of
IGF1, which is not destroyed by pasteurisation.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals pointed to
problems such as mastitis, injection-site reactions and cystic ovaries which
Monsanto warns farmers about in its product information.
Those favouring BST included scientists and veterinary organisations who
back ministers' views that a decision should be based on scientific
principles and that approval would boost the biotechnology and farming
industries.
The Association of Veterinarians in Industry said approval of BST 'will put
farmers in Europe on an equal footing with their cousins in the US'.

world and the regulations allow casein and other caseinates to be imported from countries where rinderpest or FMD
exists (if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator), Belgium does not
currently export casein to the United States. Consequently, we believe that declaring Belgium free of rinderpest
and FMD will have no significant effect on the amount of casein imported into the United States. 



The effect of declaring Belgium free of rinderpest and FMD on the trade in bovine embryos and semen will probably also
be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine embryos and semen; in 1991, the value of bovine embryo and semen
exports totalled $46.5 million and $10.2 million, respectively, while imports amounted to only $2.7 million and
$89,000, respectively. Though similar trade data was not available for Belgium, we believe that due to the relatively
small size of the Belgium market, any increase in the export of bovine embryos and semen from Belgium will have a minimal
impact on the United States market. 



Five United States importers, all of whom are considered small entities by Small Business Administration standards
(they have fewer than 100 employees), have expressed interest in importing bovine embryos and semen from Belgium.
APHIS expects the value of the anticipated imports to be minimal in comparison to the domestic production of these
entities. 



Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

the United States from any country in Europe during 1992 (USDA, Economic Research Service [ERS], ``Foreign Agricultural
Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Clearly, Europe is not a source of ruminants for
the United States, and it is unlikely that declaring Hungary free of rinderpest and FMD would have any effect on the
existing trade patterns. 



Due to current APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import any uncooked meat or meat products from Hungary.
Total U.S. meat production in 1991 (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while Hungarian meat
production in 1991 reached approximately 115,000 metric tons, about 1 percent of the U.S. total (USDA, National Agricultural
Statistics Service, ``Agricultural Statistics, 1992,'' 1992). Therefore, even if Hungary exported a significant
portion of its meat production exclusively to the United States, which is unlikely, the effect of those exports on
U.S. domestic prices or supplies would be negligible. 



As with the ruminants and meat products discussed above, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports
of milk and milk products from Hungary into the United States as a result of this proposed rule. The importation into
the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Although
the importation of casein into the United States is not regulated by quotas, world prices of casein are competitively
set. The United States does not produce casein, but does import more than half of the casein produced in the world. The
regulations currently allow casein and other caseinates to be imported into the United States from countries where
rinderpest or FMD exists if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator.
The United States imported about 662 metric tons of casein from Hungary in 1992 (USDA, ERS, ``Foreign Agricultural
Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Declaring Hungary free of rinderpest and FMD,
thus removing the requirement for written permission from the Administrator, is not expected to have any effect on
the amount of casein imported into the United States from Hungary because the current restrictions do not substantially
impede imports. 



The importation of bovine semen and cattle embryos from countries affected with rinderpest and FMD is restricted
under 9 CFR part 98. Although this proposed rule would have the effect of removing certain restrictions on the importation
of bovine semen and cattle embryos from Hungary, the economic effect of this proposed rule on the bovine semen and cattle
embryo industries is also expected to be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine semen and cattle embryos.
In 1992, the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo imports was $4 million and $195,000, respectively, while
the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo exports was $49.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively (USDA, ERS,
``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Although it is likely
that a few U.S. importers would be interested in importing bovine semen or cattle embryos from Hungary if this proposed
rule is adopted, the amount of each that might be imported would be minimal when compared to U.S. domestic production.




Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:

Portugal on the list of countries in which BSE exists had the effect of restricting the importation of some animal products
and prohibiting the importation of others. Natural sausage casings were the only affected commodity that had been
imported from Portugal in quantities sufficient to cause any economic impact. 



This rule will remove the prohibition on the importation of natural sausage casings of ruminant origin from Portugal.
About 20 small U.S. entities had been importing natural sausage casings from Portugal prior to the December 1993 interim
rule. None of the companies had been totally dependent on Portugal for sausage casings, as Portugal supplied only
2.5 percent of natural sausage casings imported into the United States. This rule will have a negligible economic

MILK STIMULANT HORMONE FOUND SAFE BY FEDERAL PANEL; 


HEALTH: A GROUP OF DOCTORS AND VETERINARIANS REPORTS THAT THE SYNTHETIC 
MATERIAL HAS NO IMPACT ON THE NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF DAIRY PRODUCTS OR MEAT. 




By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 




WASHINGTON 




Milk and meat from cows treated with a synthetic growth hormone that increases 
their milk production are safe for consumption, a federal advisory panel said 
Friday. 


The experimental use of recombinant bovine somatotropin, a synthetic version of 
a growth hormone that occurs naturally in cows and their milk, has raised 
concerns about the possible health implications for humans who consume products 
from treated cows as well as for the animals themselves. 


"This is a new technology," said Dr. Melvin Grumbach, emeritus chairman of the 
department of pediatrics at UC San Francisco and chairman of the panel. "There 
is a lot of concern . . . about the safety in terms of our food chain and in 
terms of the health of the dairy cows." 


But the panel of medical and veterinary experts, which was convened by the 
National Institutes of Health, concluded that the milk and meat from treated 
cows are safe for humans and that the hormone has no impact on the nutritional 
quality of the products. 


"This is not like an antibiotic. This is not like a synthetic steroid," 
Grumbach said. "This is a variant of a natural hormone we all have circulating 
in our blood." 


The group acknowledged, however, that it based its judgments on available data 
and did not have access to a large body of information involving the drug's 
effect on animal health that is under review by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 


The panel agreed that the hormone "does not appear to affect appreciably the 
general health of dairy cows," but it called for more research in that area, 
particularly on the incidence of mastitis, or udder infection. 


The panel said that use of the hormone "can be a very important management tool 
for American dairy farmers." 


Consumer and public interest groups criticized the panel's findings. 


"We remain unconvinced . . . that the use of bovine growth hormone in dairy 
animals poses no threat to human or animal health," said Michael K. Hansen, a 
research associate with the Consumer Policy Institute, a division of Consumers 
Union. 


Consumers Union earlier this week urged the FDA to reconsider its 1985 decision 
that milk from treated cows was safe. 


"We are seriously concerned that the data now in public hands may not present a 
complete picture of human and animal health problems," Hansen added. 


Food Animal Concerns Trust, a Chicago-based public interest organization that 
deals with issues affecting the livestock and poultry industry, charged that 
use of the hormone would cause more animal disease. This, in turn, would result 
in a greater use of antibiotics to treat the ailments and would further 
increase "dangerous residues" of antibiotics and other veterinary drugs in milk 
and beef, the group said. 


"There is widespread disease throughout the U.S. dairy herd because of the 
demands put on each cow to produce abnormally high quantities of milk," Robert 
A. Brown, president of the organization, said. "If you use (bovine growth 
hormones) to increase milk production even further, you will get more disease, 
more veterinary drug use and more drug residues in our food supply." 


At least four U.S. companies are seeking FDA approval to commercially market 
the drug. Monsanto Co., one of those seeking approval, Friday praised the 
panel's report. 


"We hope this finding will be reported to all American consumers so that they 
continue to feel confident that the milk they enjoy is safe and wholesome," 
said Lee A. Miller, vice president of the company's animal sciences division. 


The panel's decision should "quiet . . . critics who have tried to create 
needless concern among consumers about (the hormone's) safety," Miller said. 


Although the drug is currently in experimental use only, the FDA has declared 
the products safe and has allowed milk from treated cows to enter the regular 
food supply. FDA officials said, however, that milk from treated cows makes up 
about only 1% of the milk supply.

&sect;94.1(d)(1). All countries in which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist that have been declared free of
rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990, must be added to this list. Adding Austria to this list would mean
that no llama or alpaca could be imported or entered into the United States from Austria unless in accordance with 9
CFR 92.435. We are not, however, aware of any llamas or alpacas in Austria that are available for export. 







Miscellaneous







In addition to the proposed changes set forth above, we would make several nonsubstantive editorial changes in &sect;94.13
for the sake of clarity or to correct grammatical errors. 







Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 







This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 



For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.




This proposed rule, if adopted, would amend the regulations in part 94 by adding Austria to the list of countries declared
to be free of rinderpest and FMD and to the list of countries declared free of SVD. This action would remove the prohibition
on the importation into the United States, from Austria, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants,
although those importations would be subject to certain restrictions. This proposed revision would also relieve
restrictions on the importation, from Austria, of milk and milk products of ruminants. 



Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh,
chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from Austria into the United States as a result of this proposed rule. 



The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1992 was $1.24 billion, and the value of total U.S. imports of sheep in 1992
was about $2.0 million. The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from Austria during 1992. In fact, with
the exception of a small number of cattle imported from the former Czechoslovakia, no cattle or sheep were imported
into the United States from any country in Europe during 1992 (USDA, Economic Research Service [ERS], ``Foreign Agricultural
Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Clearly, Europe is not a source of ruminants for
the United States, and it is unlikely that declaring Austria free of rinderpest and FMD would have any effect on the
existing trade patterns. 



Due to current APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import any uncooked meat or meat products from Austria.
Total U.S. meat production in 1991 (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while Austrian meat production
in 1991 reached approximately 230,000 metric tons, about 2 percent of the U.S. total (USDA, National Agricultural
Statistics Service, ``Agricultural Statistics, 1992,'' 1992). Therefore, even if Austria exported a significant
portion of its meat production exclusively to the United States, which is unlikely, the effect of those exports on
U.S. domestic prices or supplies would be negligible. 



As with the ruminants and meat products discussed above, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports
of milk and milk products from Austria into the United States as a result of this proposed rule. The importation into
the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Although
the importation of casein into the United States is not regulated by quotas, world prices of casein are competitively
set. The United States does not produce casein, but does import more than half of the casein produced in the world. The
regulations currently allow casein and other caseinates to be imported into the United States from countries where
rinderpest or FMD exists if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator.
The United States did not import any casein from Austria in 1992 (USDA, ERS, ``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United
States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Declaring Austria free of rinderpest and FMD, thus removing the
requirement for written permission from the Administrator, is not expected to have any effect on the amount of casein
imported into the United States from Austria because the current restrictions do not substantially impede imports.




The importation of bovine semen and cattle embryos from countries affected with rinderpest and FMD is restricted
under 9 CFR part 98. Although this proposed rule would have the effect of removing certain restrictions on the importation
of bovine semen and cattle embryos from Austria, the economic effect of this proposed rule on the bovine semen and cattle
embryo industries is also expected to be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine semen and cattle embryos.
In 1992, the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo imports was $4 million and $195,000, respectively, while
the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo exports was $49.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively (USDA, ERS,
``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Although it is likely
that a few U.S. importers would be interested in importing bovine semen or cattle embryos from Austria if this proposed
rule is adopted, the amount of each that might be imported would be minimal when compared to U.S. domestic production.




Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 







Executive Order 12778 







This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted:
(1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive
effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file
suit in court challenging this rule. 







Paperwork Reduction Act 







In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 



et seq.



), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule have been approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number is 0579&hyph;0015.

   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Last month, international brewers sat down, put their feet up and enjoyed a
beer which had taken nearly 30 years to develop. The 150 bottles of the
premium-quality lager Nutfield Lyte were the first in the world to be brewed
using a genetically-altered yeast.
There was a real 'schoolboy element' among some of the thrilled imbibers on
receiving their bottle of the new beer, reports Bernard Atkinson, director
of BRF International, in Nutfield, Surrey, which carries out pre-competitive
research into brewing. BRF's members account for 25 per cent of the world's
brewing volume.
The eager public, however, will have to wait before being able to taste such
a novel drink. The aim of the exercise, says Atkinson, has been to
demonstrate the possibilities that genetic engineering opens up to the
brewing industry.
If brewers decide to use BRF's genetically-altered yeast, which was approved
for UK use by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes last
month, they could have a beer on the market by the end of the year.
More likely, says Atkinson, is that they will use the genetic engineering
techniques to adapt their own favourite yeasts, which could take several
years. 'We have modified our yeast, not the brewers'. The sensible thing
would be for them to modify their own yeasts.'
Nevertheless, believes Atkinson, the breakthrough has demonstrated to both
brewers and the general public what can be achieved using
genetically-altered food processes. He thinks Nutfield Lyte will help fuel
the debate. 'Science doesn't actually leap into the marketplace. It takes
time for people to accept the developments,' he says. 'People's thought
processes are moving on. The reality is that until you have a hard case the
debate doesn't become focused. The beer is here now; people can drink it.'
The debate about genetic engineering's impact on foods is likely to
intensify this year as milk from cows treated with the manufactured hormone
bovine somatotrophin (BST), which greatly stimulates milk production, and
tomatoes, genetically altered to prevent them turning squashy, appear on
American supermarket shelves.
They could be the first of many such foods, says Robin Jenkins, of Genetics
Forum, the London-based group which argues for the responsible use of
genetic engineering technology. 'There isn't a single fruit, vegetable or
animal that isn't the subject of research of some kind.'
His main concern about genetic engineering is that 'the technology has moved
ahead of the science base'. He believes that until the individual genomes
are mapped out, there could be risks in moving genes from one organism to
another.
He also believes that most genetically-altered foods are produced to suit
food manufacturers, not consumers. 'There is no way the technology can be
market led. The marketing department can't go down to the research
department and ask them to produce spinach which tastes like chocolate,
which children would love to eat and which parents would love them to have
because it's good for them.'
Further, he believes that food companies have spent so much on developing
the products - Monsanto and other chemical companies have spent close on
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) developing the BST hormone - that the technology
will be foisted on an unwilling public, whatever the cost.
Those lobbying against genetically-engineered foods believe they could make
dining a risky process, labelling them 'Frankenfoods'. The
genetically-altered tomatoes, being developed by the Californian
biotechnology company Calgene, and Zeneca, formerly part of Britain's ICI,
use an antibiotic-resistant marker to signal the successful transfer of the
added gene, which blocks the enzyme that makes tomatoes soften and
eventually go squashy. One fear in the long term is that if enough tomatoes
are eaten the consumer could inherit a resistance to that antibiotic.
Calgene responds by saying that the marker is de-activated once it enters
the human digestive system, and therefore cannot produce any unwanted
side-effects.
The tomato has yet to receive approval from the US Food and Drug
Administration, but a spokesperson for Calgene said that once the green
light was given it would take only three to six months to get the new tomato
on to US supermarket shelves.
Atkinson makes a straightforward distinction between the tomatoes and his
beer: in the former, the new gene is part of the food; in the latter it is
only part of the food production process, as is the use of BST in increasing
milk yields. The genetically-altered yeast used in the brewing process is
removed and under current regulations has to be destroyed. 'You're not
tasting genetically-altered beer, you're tasting beer produced by
genetically-altered yeast,' he adds.
The brewers altered a gene in order to produce a low-carbohydrate beer, with
fewer calories than traditional brews. Brewer's yeasts, unlike other strains
of yeast, lack the enzyme which converts the starch from the malt into
alcohol. By adding an enzyme-producing gene from another yeast the same
amount of alcohol can be produced from less starch.
Atkinson believes that genes with different properties could enable beer
makers to produce the required brew more easily. One potential application
he cites is in the production of a better-tasting beer. A particular 'off
flavour' produced by yeasts is a butterscotch taste. Today brewers need to
manipulate the fermentation process in order to eliminate the taste.
Eventually this could be done by altering the yeast.
It could also prove a simpler process to develop new ranges of beer. 'Now,
if you want a new flavour in your beer you have to find a new yeast. Now,
we're talking about taking a yeast you know about and tuning it. It's a very
elegant solution.'
While tomato and beer makers are pondering the potential of such gene
manipulation, some genetically-altered processes are already in widespread
use, in the production of cheese, for example.
Traditionally, the enzyme needed to clot milk and turn it into cheese, is
extracted as rennet from a calf's stomach. Researchers have now cloned the
gene for the clotting enzyme and transferred it to bacteria, which produce
large quantities of rennet in fermenters.
Only the enzyme itself is used in the cheese-making process. And, says Mike
Gasson, head of the genetics and microbiology department at the Institute of
Food Research in Norwich, the enzyme is 'nature identical' to the one
extracted from the stomachs of dead calves.
Gasson describes the laboratory production of the enzyme as 'squeaky clean'.
Jenkins, too, is supportive of this type of genetic engineering, and
believes many of the big food companies are doing innovative work in the
areas of food production.
However, the sale of these cheeses has highlighted the problem of whether
genetically-altered foods, or those produced using gene alteration
techniques, should be labelled. The issue has produced strong reactions in
the US, where milk produced using BST does not have to be labelled to that
effect. In Europe, too, it looks unlikely that such foods will be labelled.
In the UK, the Co-op food chain labels cheeses if they are produced using
the laboratory-created enzyme. But recent recommendations from the
Polkinghorne ethical committee say foods need only be labelled when they
contain a human gene, or if a non-vegetarian gene is inserted into a food
which vegetarians might eat - a fish gene into a tomato, say - or if the new
gene might offend on religious grounds.
As a result, says Jenkins, a beef product which contained a gene from a pig
would be labelled as such; a beef product which contained a gene from a
horse would not be labelled, although many people would find the latter more
distasteful. 'All they did,' he complains, 'was pander to those who
responded loudest.'

This rule adds Germany to the list in part 94 of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. This action removes
the prohibition on the importation into the United States from Germany of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen
meat from ruminants, and relieves restrictions on the importation from Germany of milk and milk products from ruminants.
This action does not relieve restrictions on the importation of live swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of swine
from Germany because Germany is still considered to be affected with hog cholera and SVD.

Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh,
chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from Germany into the United States as a result of this rule.

The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1992 was $1.24 billion; U.S. imports of sheep in 1992 totalled about $2 million.
The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from Germany during 1992. In fact, no cattle or sheep were imported
into the United States from any country in Western Europe during 1992 (USDA, National Agricultural Statistical Service
[NASS], Agricultural Statistics Board [ASB] ``Agricultural Statistics, 1992''). Western Europe is not a source
of ruminants for the United States and we anticipate that any increase in the importation of ruminants from Germany
as a result of this rule would have a negligible impact on existing trade patterns.

Currently, due to APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import uncooked meat or meat products from Germany.
In 1991, total meat production in the United States (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while
total meat production in Germany (excluding pork) was 2.2 million metric tons, about 20 percent of United States production.
It is improbable that Germany would begin to export any significant portion of its meat products to the United States
as a result of this rule. Therefore, we estimate that the effect of this rule on domestic meat prices or supplies would
be insignificant.

Similarily, we do not anticipate a major increase in exports of milk and milk products from Germany into the United
States as a result of this rule. Importation into the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other
caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Furthermore, while the United States imports more than half of the casein produced
in the world and the regulations allow casein and other caseinates to be imported from countries where rinderpest
or FMD exists (if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator), Germany currently
exports only a small amount of casein to the United States. For example, in 1992, the United States imported 95,000
metric tons of casein worldwide, but only about 2,400 metric tons (2.53 percent of worldwide imports) from Germany.
Consequently, we believe that declaring Germany free of rinderpest and FMD will have no significant effect on the
amount of casein imported into the United States.

The effect of declaring Germany free of rinderpest and FMD on the trade in bovine embryos and semen would also be minimal.
The United States is a net exporter of bovine embryos and semen; in 1991, the value of bovine embryo and semen exports
totalled to $46.5 million and 10.2 million, respectively, while imports amounted to only $2.7 million and $89,159,
respectively. Though similar trade data was not available for Germany, we believe that due to the relatively small
size of the German market, any increase in the export of bovine embryos and semen from Germany would have a minimal impact
on the United States market.

It is not likely that many United States importers, all of whom are considered small entities by Small Business Administration
standards (defined as having fewer than 100 employees), will be interested in importing bovine embryos and semen
from Germany. APHIS expects that the value of any imports will be minimal in comparison to the domestic production
of these entities.

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Last week, US supermarkets received the first deliveries of milk produced by
cows which had undergone a new form of hormone treatment that greatly
stimulates milk production.
The hormone, known as bovine somatotrophin (BST) and developed by Monsanto
and other chemical companies at a cost approaching Dollars 1bn, is a
manufactured version of a naturally occurring hormone. Marketed under the
name Posilac, it has been hailed as an important advance in bio-engineering.
According to the US Food and Drug Administration, milk and meat from cows
who have been treated with it are safe and virtually indistinguishable from
the normal product.
But these benefits have not prevented BST being swept up in a storm of
controversy in the US as well as the European Union, where a ban on its use
must be reviewed later this year. Fears about the hormone centre not just on
the possible health effects, but also on the damage that a sudden surge in
milk production could do to the subsidy-laden agricultural economies of
Europe and North America.
Use of the hormone in the US was finally approved last November after
decades of study and debate. At the same time the White House ordered a
study of the potential impact on a market already struggling with milk
surpluses. This showed that BST could boost US milk production by 1 per cent
a year over the next six years. Unless BST triggered a big change in milk
consumption patterns, the US government would be obliged by its dairy
support programme to buy up almost all of the additional production at a
cost over five years of more than Dollars 500m, an increase of 40 per cent
in its annual dairy outlays.
Although farmers who are quickest to use the drug would enjoy a short-term
profit boost, the study suggests that, as a result of larger and fewer dairy
farms and increasing rural depopulation, the net economic effect over five
years would be to reduce farm income by 1 per cent and shrink dairy herds by
up to 30 per cent. Nor would the consumer benefit, because the subsidy
payments would ensure that the retail price did not fall noticeably.
Resistance to BST has been building up for some time. Consumer and farm
groups, led by Washington-based activist Jeremy Rifkin who heads the Pure
Food Campaign, have staged protests and milk dumpings throughout the US. Ms
Robin Douthitt, professor of consumer science at the University of
Wisconsin, says that, while other bio-tech projects aim to produce a better
tomato or a tastier potato, BST-treated milk brings no benefit to consumers;
and because BST-treated milk is perceived as unnatural, it is seen as adding
risk to a product generally considered as pure.
Fearing a consumer backlash, nearly 200 US food companies, including large
grocery and convenience store chains and 14 dairy co-operatives, have asked
their suppliers not to deliver hormone-enhanced milk for three months to
give them a chance to assess the market impact. In the two top dairy states,
Wisconsin and California, six school districts have asked that milk
delivered to their cafeterias come from untreated cows.
However, consumers have few ways of ensuring that the milk they receive is
from BST-free herds, and the US government, keen to support biotechnology,
is making it difficult for processors to label their milk free of artificial
hormone treatments by requiring them to prove their claims with detailed
documentation. Monsanto is also suing two small dairy processors for using a
BST-free label and has sent warning letters to others.
The launch of BST in the US raises doubts about whether the European
Commission can continue to resist its use in Europe, where it is the subject
of a four-year-old moratorium. Its use could also erupt into a transatlantic
trade dispute, highlighting the potential clash between the ethics of food
production and the pressure for unrestricted commerce under the new General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
'The European Union emphasises quality, wholesome products rather than
quantity,' said a Commission official. 'We're stronger on that than the US.
The US tends to be more geared to market forces, competitiveness, economies
of scale and technological innovation.'
Brussels has no quarrel with the safety of BST for human consumption, but it
is concerned about its use on environmental and economic grounds. It
believes that consumers would see dairy products from cows injected with BST
as adulterated and would respond by cutting down on all milk products. A
German survey showed that dairy consumption would drop by 11 per cent if BST
were introduced.
Mr Steve Emmott of BST Concern, a UK campaign representing farmers,
environmentalists and animal welfare groups, says: 'This is the first
flagship of the biotechnology industry coming to the market. But we don't
think BST is a useful way of using the technology . . . It's a product no
one wants or needs apart from the manufacturers. We don't need surplus milk.
And we don't need milk with genetically engineered hormones.'
Until recently, Mr Rene Steichen, the agriculture commissioner, indicated
that BST-produced dairy goods would not be allowed into the European Union
while the moratorium remained in force. But US officials say any such ban is
likely to be challenged, just as the US fought the EU's 1989 ban on imports
of US meat produced with growth hormones. US dairy exports to the EU amount
to only Dollars 45m a year. 'But it's an issue of principle,' said a US
official. In any case, the US will have greater access to the European
market for its dairy goods under the Gatt agreement.
The Gatt view is that an import ban would be difficult to justify, because
products may in future only be challenged on strictly scientific criteria as
opposed to social or ethical considerations.
However, the matter does not stop at an import ban. The White House report
suggests that the US might challenge any extension of the EU moratorium.
'For countries to ban BST use, after the hormone has been scientifically
found to be safe, would undermine efforts to eliminate unfair trade barriers
to US exports,' it says.
At the end of the year, farm ministers must decide the future of BST in
Europe. Last December, the Commission lost its battle to keep the moratorium
on BST in place until 2000. The ministers agreed only to extend it until the
end of this year, saying they wanted to monitor its impact in the US, the
trade implications and the effect on European competitiveness.
To strengthen its hand, the Commission has assembled a long list of
arguments against BST. It says that using the drug is not compatible with
Common Agricultural Policy reforms designed to reduce milk output, and is
likely to accelerate the trend towards bigger and fewer dairy farms and to
lead to more cows being slaughtered and more beef cattle raised instead,
adding to the beef mountain.
US officials counter that, if fewer cows are needed to produce a given
amount of milk, BST helps the environment by cutting manure and methane
production and the amount of water, land and chemicals used. They say a
small well-managed farm could benefit as much or more from BST use as a big,
poorly managed one.
However, the Commission is polishing up a new weapon in its armoury to keep
the moratorium going. It argues that guaranteeing its dairy products free of
BST could give the EU a competitive advantage over US exports - and even a
chance to charge a premium - in world markets where BST is either not used
or not appreciated such as in Japan.
'We didn't think of that,' admitted a senior US agriculture official
ruefully.

Kevin Gilmore, executive chairman, said Sikorski - son of a Polish immigrant
and one-time professional footballer with Swindon Town - was 'ideally
placed' to push the products forward.
'Jurek will not only accelerate our development programmes but help us
replace our entrepreneurial style with the kind of structured line
management we now need,' he added.
John Pool, Proteus's 50-year-old managing director, has been named deputy

of Sciences, Yerevan; UDC 575.1] 
  [Abstract] The genus specificity of the human 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (AKTG)--a peptide consisting of 39 
amino acids which is produced and secreted in the hypophysis and 
which stimulates biosynthesis of secretion of corticosteroids in 
the adrenal cortex--and the desire to avoid unnecessary immune 
reactions as well as the expense and tediousness of chemical 
synthesis of the human adrenocorticotropic hormone prompted a 
study of the expression of the human adrenocorticotropic hormone 
in the form of a hybrid with S. aureus protein A. 
This hybrid protein can be easily isolated from 
Escherichia coli proteins. This system was used to 
obtain the insulin-like growth factor IFH-I and to produce the 
bovine adrenocorticotropic hormone. The plasmids containing most 
of the S. aureus protein A gene as well as the 
plasmids containing the bovine adrenocorticotropic hormone pUC 
19/1, pUC 19/7, and pUC 19/Pro were used to construct 
recombinant plasmids. The experiment procedure is outlined. The 
hybrid gene sequence constructed as a result contains the 
sequences which encode protein A of S. aureus and 
human adrenocorticotropic hormone located in the same reading 
frame. Synthetic adapter sequences whose specific cleaving will 
eventually make it possible to isolate the end product from the 
fused protein are built in between these sequences. The fused 
protein synthesis detection procedure is described and the 
possibility of protein A secretion by E. coli cell 
derivatives is established. The conclusion is drawn that the 
constructed plasmids direct the human adrenocorticotropic 
hormone-containing fused protein synthesis in E. 
coli. The authors are grateful to A.A. Shulga for help with 
mutagenesis. Figures 1; references 9: 4 Russian, 5 Western.

MOVIES SITING SETS IN STATE OF WASHINGTON 




By TERENCE FINAN, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 




SEATTLE 




When Steven Spielberg brought his movie production company to the small eastern 
Washington towns of Sprague and Moses Lake for the filming of "Always," he had 
planned to stay less than a week. 


But after seeing the diversity of the landscape and the possibilities for the 
film, he wound up staying 20 days. 


The story of Spielberg's discovery of Washington is becoming a common one, and 
Hollywood moguls, television crews and producers of commercials are turning the 
state into one of the most popular spots in the country for filming. 


"If you look back at the state's history, there were some years when there was 
a lot (of film production) going on," said Lynn Murphy, assistant manager in 
the state's Department of Trade and Economic Development's Film &amp; Video 
Office. "But our reputation as a film center has really grown in the past three 
or four years." 


The Film &amp; Video Office recently released statistics showing a dramatic 
jump in the money spent by out-of-state production companies. 


In 1985 a total of $5.5 million in direct spending was generated by 
out-of-state film companies. A spate of commercials boosted that number to $12 
million -- a 118% increase -- in 1986. In 1987 and 1988 the total grew to $14 
million and $16.9 million respectively, and last year production companies 
spent $20.2 million. 


Feature films such as "Always" brought the most income to the state in 1989, 
with producers spending $10.8 million. Direct spending by commercial production 
companies was $7.6 million, while documentary, industrial, television and other 
projects brought in $1.6 million. 


In-state production companies have also grown significantly, contributing $33.7 
million last year to the state economy, a 48% increase over 1988's spending. 


In all, last year there were 14 feature films and television movies made in the 
state; 27 video and television episodes; more than 80 commercials; and about 37 
industrial videos, documentaries and other projects. 


"We don't have any hard numbers right now, but I am confident we are in the top 
10 production states based on the number of film days and the dollars spent on 
production," Murphy said. 


In-state companies obviously know what the state has to offer, but what is the 
attraction for out-of-state producers? 


Murphy said one big plus is the availability of experienced crew staffers -- 
such as gaffers, camera people, special effects and wardrobe experts. 


"That means producers don't have to bring in a lot of people and pay for their 
housing and per diem expenses, so they can really keep their production costs 
down," she said. 


Just as important, however, is the combination of terrain that offers virtually 
any kind of landscape needed -- from seascapes to mountains to deserts, from 
small farm communities to All-American suburbs to sprawling urban areas. 


"In the past when you said Washington state people thought just of forests. But 
they're finding there's a lot more," Murphy said. 


" 'I Love You to Death' needed a Pennsylvania coal mining town, and it was 
filmed in Tacoma. 'The Fabulous Baker Boys' wanted seedy night spots, so we 
found them in downtown Seattle. 'The Hunt for Red October' was filmed in Port 
Angeles, Bremerton and around Puget Sound -- they needed a lot of water. 


" 'War of the Roses' wanted a New England setting but didn't want to go to New 
England, so we took them to Coupeville," Murphy said. "We do New England very 
well."

The company said its test confirmed the BSE diagnosis in a sample of 169
dead cattle brains and suggested it could be used in other body organs, and
blood, to provide a test for use on live animals.
Mr Jurek Sikorski, Proteus' business development and marketing director,
said it was in talks with an animal health company about developing,
manufacturing and marketing the test, which it expects to be available by
1997.
The potential market for a BSE test for live cattle and carcasses destined
for human consumption is estimated at Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) in Europe.
There is currently no test for BSE on live cattle. About 5 per cent of
suspected animals destroyed are found, on post mortem, not to have it.
The incidence of BSE has fallen dramatically this year and farmers are
hoping it will be virtually wiped out by the end of the decade.
