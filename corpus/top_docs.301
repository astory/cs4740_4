CARSON FIRED BY BROWNS AFTER 42-0 DEFEAT TO BILLS

The Cleveland Browns, off to their worst start since 1984, fired Coach Bud 
Carson on Monday, the day after their worst home loss ever. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Art Modell, who promised last year that Carson would be his last head 
coach, changed his mind after Sunday's 42-0 loss to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an embarrassment for all of us," Modell said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, the first coaching casualty of the season, was replaced by offensive 
coordinator Jim Shofner. 
</P>
<P>
Modell asked Shofner to take over for at least the rest of the season. He 
becomes the Browns' ninth head coach. Carson's three-year contract runs through 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Carson said Monday he thought the Browns (2-7) were back on track when they 
lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 20-17, on a last-minute field goal a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected to play well last night, and we did not do it," Carson said. "Not 
only did we not do it, we played as badly as we can play." 
</P>
<P>
Carson gambled by starting Mike Pagel at quarterback against the Bills, instead 
of Bernie Kosar. Kosar will start when the Browns play again on Nov. 18 against 
Houston, Shofner said. The Browns have a bye this week. 
</P>
<P>
Including playoff games, Carson was 12-14-1 with the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, 59, replaced Marty Schottenheimer as the Brown coach on Jan. 27, 1989, 
after Schottenheimer left in a dispute with Modell over coaching styles. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns were 9-6-1 and AFC Central champions under Carson last year, making 
it to the AFC title game before losing to Denver. But 1990 has been a 
nightmare, with injuries, retirements and holdouts wiping out Cleveland's 
offensive line and fouling up the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel Bud was given a fair shake," said safety Felix Wright, who staged 
a bitter holdout before the season. "I'm disappointed. Who knows what would 
have happened if we were all together during training camp, and happy?"

EX-RAM YOUNG IS A CATCH FOR BRONCOS

<P>
Once again, the Rams and Raiders won't be meeting in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
How about an ex-Raider vs. an ex-Ram? 
</P>
<P>
OK, there's ex-Raider linebacker Matt Millen of the 49ers vs. ex-Ram and 
ex-UCLA Bruin receiver Michael Young, who helped quarterback John Elway and the 
Broncos break up Sunday's AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Young, left unprotected by the Rams last winter and signed by the Broncos as a 
Plan B free agent, caught two passes -- one for 70 yards and a touchdown, the 
other for 53, setting up another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Was he surprised? 
</P>
<P>
"Coming here, I thought that if I made the team, I'd have a chance to 
participate and do some things," Young said. "But never to this extent. I never 
would have dreamed of having a game like this." 
</P>
<P>
Mad at the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
"They just had a change in philosophy," Young said. "There was a new offensive 
coordinator (Ernie Zampese) coming in and I wasn't his type of player. Hey, 
everybody has their opinion. I'm not upset at all at them. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could say I had animosity toward 'em but I'd be lying if I said that. 
I almost stayed there because I knew I had a secure job as a backup receiver. 
But I knew that being a backup receiver on the Rams was like being a tackle. I 
mean, I knew I was never going to see any kind of action unless someone got 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't leave because I liked it so much. But I tell you what, I like 
it a hell of a lot better here." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos played the second half without rookie running back Bobby Humphrey, 
and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Sammy Winder took over and gained 37 yards -- in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Will Humphrey be ready for the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Reeves said he has two broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," said Humphrey, who will be X-rayed again today. 
</P>
<P>
Eight different Denver receivers caught passes, but when asked if Cleveland's 
secondary could have done anything differently to stop them, cornerback Frank 
Minnifield failed to come up with answers. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't pay me to make that evaluation," Minnifield said. "I'm the CB, not 
the HC." 
</P>
<P>
HC? 
</P>
<P>
"Head coach." 
</P>
<P>
OK. But what about . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
"Don't even ask me," Minnifield said. "I didn't sit and watch the game. I 
played it. There was no thought process. They just pay me to cover wide 
receivers. You ask me to evaluate something, you ain't doing me no service 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
It was Minnifield who slipped and fell, freeing Young for his 70-yard touchdown 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Carson, despite the loss, was satisfied with his first season coaching the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were down and out, everybody said we were finished," Carson said. "But 
we came back, week by week, every day except today. I'd say we made a hell of a 
run at it." 
</P>
<P>
What did Elway think of the crowd noise that drowned out Cleveland counterpart 
Bernie Kosar's signals? 
</P>
<P>
"I had trouble hearing when we had the ball," Elway said. "I can only imagine 
what it was like for Bernie." 
</P>
<P>
Denver radio station KHOW played a new tune all week, sung to the tune of the 
old Coasters hit, "Charlie Brown." It went: 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 They're real clowns, those Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 They're gonna get beat, gonna miss the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the Denver Broncos always pickin' on us?

MIAMI BEATS BROWNS WITH FIELD GOAL IN OT

<P>
Miami Dolphins rookie Pete Stoyanovich may have saved more than a game with his 
35-yard field goal in overtime Sunday against the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
He also may have saved his job. 
</P>
<P>
Stoyanovich missed a 46-yard field goal in the third period and a 45-yarder 
with three seconds left in regulation time, but gave the Dolphins a 13-10 
victory when he connected on Miami's first possession in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big, big kick in his career," Dolphin Coach Don Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
Stoyanovich, an eighth-round draft choice who became Miami's kicker when 
veteran Fuad Reveiz was injured in training camp, said he was confident about 
the final kick despite his earlier misses. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that far out," he said. "I had no doubt I was going to make it. I'm 
just really fortunate that the team gave me a second opportunity to win it for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland took the kickoff to start overtime and drove 46 yards, but Matt Bahr 
was wide left on a 44-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"We all miss," Stoyanovich said. "Nobody's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The winner, with 8:32 left, capped a 55-yard drive that included two 
third-and-10 passes from Dan Marino to Fred Banks. On the first pass, Stephen 
Braggs was called for a 26-yard pass interference penalty at the Cleveland 47. 
The second pass was a 20-yard completion to the Cleveland 27. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's previous home games this season, both losses, also were decided on the 
game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been two games we should have won at the end, but we didn't," 
Marino said. "This will be a big boost for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (2-3) and Browns (3-2) both had a chance to win the game in a wild 
final minute in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Felix Wright returned an interception to the Miami 37 with 1:08 
left, but Louis Oliver intercepted Bernie Kosar's pass two plays later. Marino 
completed two passes for 23 yards before Stoyanovich missed. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns drove to Miami's 45-yard line with five minutes to go in the fourth 
quarter. Two penalties set them back, and safety Jarvis Williams broke up a 
third-down pass at the Miami 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do it when we had to," Browns Coach Bud Carson said. "We had our 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland was hampered by eight penalties for 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy football," Carson said. "Ten points don't win many 
football games."

TELEVISION: MADDEN, WALSH TALK NOW, THEN LATER ON GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a pro football fan, it's pretty hard to beat today's fare. Not one 
but two championship games. 
</P>
<P>
You're going to be hearing analysis before, during and after both games, and 
the main men are Bill Walsh and John Madden. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, the NBC newcomer, knows a lot about the San Francisco 49ers, but 
circumstances dictate that he works the AFC game between the Cleveland Browns 
and the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has Madden, a former AFC coach, on the NFC game between the Rams and the 
49ers at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Both commentators were interviewed last week. First, Madden's views. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Can the Rams beat the 49ers? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Rams are going to have to come up with their best defensive game of 
the year. If they don't, they're in trouble. Then it becomes a shootout, and 
they're going to have to score a hell of a lot of points. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, the Rams can score a lot of points. They're capable of doing that. But 
I really believe the Rams, defensively, are going to have to play above their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Might the 49ers, who manhandled Minnesota last weekend, be a little 
overconfident and maybe a little complacent? 
</P>
<P>
A: If it was anyone but the Rams, they could be. If the Giants had won, they 
could be. But they know first hand what the Rams can do. They have too much 
respect for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
I've been working on my All-Madden team and have talked with some of the 49ers, 
and when I ask what team, besides the 49ers, is the best, every guy says the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Should the Rams try to put a lot of pressure on Joe Montana? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're going to have to pressure him to stay in the middle, like they did 
(Philadelphia's Randall) Cunningham. I don't think sacks, either way, are going 
to be a big thing in this game. What the Rams have to do more than anything 
else is tackle the receivers as soon as they catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
What they can't do is let Jerry Rice break away for a 70-yard touchdown after 
he catches a short pass, like he did against the Vikings. They can't let John 
Taylor break away like he did against them in that Monday night game. The Rams 
look like they're tackling better since that game. 
</P>
<P>
You're not going to shut out Rice and Taylor. But when they do catch the ball, 
you've got to tackle them, put the clamps on 'em. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You grew up with John Robinson in Daly City, Calif. He has been your 
lifelong friend and he once coached your running backs when you were coaching 
the Oakland Raiders. Last week, Robinson said, despite his reputation for being 
a running coach, that he has really been a passing coach all along. 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't believe that. I say that respectfully. It's just that I know John as 
well as anybody. He is a running coach. He knows more about runners and running 
backs than any coach in the league, maybe more than anyone who has ever coached 
in this league. 
</P>
<P>
But he's not dumb. He's smart enough to know that with the personnel he now 
has, passing is the way to go. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out, not 
when you have guys like Jim Everett and Flipper Anderson and Henry Ellard. 
They've even been working Ron Brown into the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Looking at it from another point of view, what must the 49ers do to win? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think it's the same for the 49ers as the Rams. The team that tackles the 
best is going to win this game. The 49ers aren't going to get a lot of sacks. 
</P>
<P>
What the 49ers have to do is help Montana get into his rhythm. If he does that, 
the 49ers are going to be hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not saying it can't be done. Once the Rams beat Philadelphia, all they had 
to do to get to the Super Bowl was beat two teams they beat during the season, 
the Giants and 49ers. And they've already done half of that. 
</P>
<P>
And now from Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The last two times Denver and Cleveland met for the AFC championship, the 
Broncos won both times, first on a 15-play, 98-yard drive and then when the 
Browns' Earnest Byner fumbled on the three-yard line. Might the Browns be a 
little gun-shy? 
</P>
<P>
A: That's a good point. If they have to measure every step and worry about 
making a mistake, they'll be in trouble. In a game like this, you have to let 
it fly. It's up to (Coach) Bud Carson to keep the team loose, and it's up to 
(owner) Art Modell not to put any extra heat on them publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You were a passing coach. What's your opinion of the two quarterbacks in 
this game, Cleveland's Bernie Kosar and Denver's John Elway? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're two of the best quarterbacks in football. Elway is more active. 
Kosar has a quicker release and is more accurate on shorter passes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And the receivers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Both teams also have a lot of talent in this area. It's really a tossup. 
Webster Slaughter, Reggie Langhorne, Ozzie Newsome and Eric Metcalf coming out 
of the backfield for the Browns is a very talented group. 
</P>
<P>
We talked to Elway about his receivers before the Pittsburgh game. He knows his 
people so well. He said Mark Jackson is the quickest and Vance Johnson is also 
quick, and more dependable. Michael Young has the best hands and runs the best 
routes. He is extremely good. When it's third down and they need the yards, 
Young is the guy Elway likes to go to. They don't use Ricky Nattiel that much, 
but he's good going downfield. And Steve Sewell, like Metcalf for the Browns, 
is good coming out of the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The consensus seems to be the Super Bowl winner will again come from the 
NFC. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, Cincinnati came close to the 49ers last year (the Bengals lost, 
20-16), so that shows anything can happen. But there is no question the NFC is 
the stronger, more physical conference.

AFC LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, BUT WILL IT BE SUPER?; 
</P>
<P>
PREVIEW: BENGALS AND OILERS, WITH HIGH-TECH OFFENSES, HAVE BEST CHANCE TO 
OVERCOME SIX SUPER BOWL LOSSES IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In each of the past six years, the American Football Conference has resembled 
an express train moving smoothly through the countryside toward the end of the 
line, where it spectacularly derails. 
</P>
<P>
AFC teams have played the NFC on even terms each season since 1984, winning 
their share of the annual interconference series. Then each time, their 
champions have gotten untracked on the last afternoon, losing six consecutive 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can really explain it," Cincinnati Bengal Coach Sam Wyche said the 
other day, reviewing the AFC's record slump. "But I can't see it going on much 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
Wyche's team, in fact, could reverse the momentum. The Bengals and Houston 
Oilers seem to be the best in their conference, and one or the other can be 
expected to represent the AFC in Super Bowl XXV, Jan. 27 in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
Both are modern offensive teams. The Bengals play football the San Francisco 
49er way -- with a major new component, Wyche's no-huddle approach -- and the 
Oilers have converted to the run-and-shoot formation, which makes use of four 
wide receivers at all times. 
</P>
<P>
But they converted only a few weeks ago. The run and shoot is a radical 
departure from conventional football, and the Oilers may need a season of 
seasoning. The Bengals don't. 
</P>
<P>
Their time-proven offense took Wyche to the Super Bowl only 18 months ago, and 
that day, Cincinnati quarterback Boomer Esiason led Joe Montana's team until 
the last minute, when Montana, ending a 20-16 rouser, did what he usually does. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Cincinnati's problem is the potency of its own division, the AFC's 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals are looking for big trouble from all three of their Central 
Division rivals -- the Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Oilers and Cleveland 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
They also expect trouble from the evenly matched top four in the AFC West: the 
Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs, Denver Broncos and San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
These are the AFC's big eight -- of whom only five can make the 1990 playoffs 
along with an Eastern entry, the New York Jets or Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
Under a revised playoff system, three wild-card teams from each conference will 
compete with the six division winners, starting Jan. 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches expect Denver to be one of the AFC's six. The Broncos are a more 
solid group than they seemed in Super Bowl XXIV, where Montana led the 49ers to 
a 55-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
That was the third of four jolts that Denver Coach Dan Reeves has taken in the 
past four years. His recent heart attack followed three Super Bowl losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Bouncing back is what life is all about," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
He's right about that, although this season, it will be either Cincinnati or 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The AFC top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1) CINCINNATI BENGALS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Boomer Esiason 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Sam Wyche (51-47) 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals and 49ers are both led by Bill Walsh-trained coaches, Wyche and 
George Seifert, and their modern offenses are similar. A possibly decisive 
difference is that the 49ers spend heavily for talent. In contrast, one of 
Cincinnati's best two linemen, Max Montoya, went to the Raiders in the kind of 
Plan B exodus that San Francisco avoids by outbidding everyone else. Nor have 
the Bengals replaced injured back Ickey Woods. They can still win with Wyche's 
no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
2) HOUSTON OILERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Warren Moon 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jack Pardee (first year) 
</P>
<P>
Their opponents describe this team's talent as the best that ever lined up in 
the run-and-shoot formation, which Pardee previously brought to two other 
Houston winners: the United States Football League's Gamblers and the Southwest 
Conference's Cougars. The Oilers' unsurpassed blocking starts with Bruce 
Matthews, the receiving with Drew Hill and Ernest Givins. A defensive 
specialist, Pardee will address the problems on that side. The question is how 
fast they can adjust to a strange new offense. 
</P>
<P>
3) DENVER BRONCOS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: John Elway 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dan Reeves (91-55-1) 
</P>
<P>
Their Super Bowl wipeout last winter is still held against the Broncos by the 
same people who seem to forget that in Montana's three-game playoff parade, the 
49ers rolled over the Vikings and Rams the same way. Last year, when the 
Broncos' ancient weaknesses evaporated with a new defense and runner, Bobby 
Humphrey, they were 6-0 over the AFC in oxygen-thin Mile High Stadium. Nobody 
in the NFL comes close to matching Denver's home-field edge. 
</P>
<P>
4) PITTSBURGH STEELERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Bubby Brister 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Chuck Noll (193-140-1) 
</P>
<P>
Having survived the winning '70s and slumping '80s, Noll hits the '90s with a 
good, young offense and improving defensive personnel. His Merrill Hoge-Tim 
Worley backfield became the NFL's best last year, and new coordinator Joe 
Walton will help the offense. The two questions: Is Brister an NFL comer? Can 
the defense hold the edge it got last year with coordinator Rod Rust, the new 
coach at New England? The defensive standout is cornerback Rod Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
5) SAN DIEGO CHARGERS 
</P>
<P>
QB: Mark Vlasic, Billy Joe Tolliver 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dan Henning (6-10) 
</P>
<P>
With either youngster pitching for San Diego, the question is whether the 
Broncos, Chargers, Raiders or Chiefs will break out of the pack in a year when 
Denver has the only established quarterback. At most other positions, San Diego 
could be slightly ahead with runner Marion Butts, receiver Anthony Miller, 
linebacker Billy Ray Smith and the depth stored by former General Manager Steve 
Ortmayer and the incumbent, Bobby Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
6) RAIDERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Jay Schroeder 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Art Shell (7-5) 
</P>
<P>
See paragraph above for a more exact placing of the Raiders, who, in various 
media surveys, have been ranked from first to last in their division -- and who 
have been mentioned by others for both the Super Bowl and the AFC cellar. They 
seem clearly stronger defensively and in the offensive line, and they have the 
fastest receivers in football. All they want from Schroeder is occasional 
accuracy on their favorite missile, the long, long pass to one of those 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
7) KANSAS CITY CHIEFS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Steve DeBerg 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Marty Schottenheimer 
</P>
<P>
(8-7-1) 
</P>
<P>
If for once DeBerg could play like Bernie Kosar or Jim Kelly, the Chiefs would 
jump to the head of the class in the AFC and even worry the NFC in the Super 
Bowl. They're sound enough elsewhere. They have a few receivers and a big 
running back, Christian Okoye, and at linebacker they line up an MVP-type in 
Derrick Thomas who would make any defense look good. When they have all their 
players, their secondary is among the finest. But it's really all up to DeBerg. 
</P>
<P>
8) CLEVELAND BROWNS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Bernie Kosar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bud Carson (10-7-1) 
</P>
<P>
Carson was 58 last year when they finally gave him an NFL team, and he won a 
division title. Then the Browns beat Buffalo in the playoffs before losing the 
AFC title game again in Denver. Although their quarterback ranks with the NFL's 
best, the Browns may otherwise be a touch short in talent. Still, some people 
say they'll win again with running backs Eric Metcalf and Kevin Mack, and with 
Clay Matthews and Michael Dean Perry on defense. 
</P>
<P>
9) BUFFALO BILLS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Jim Kelly 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Marv Levy (31-26) 
</P>
<P>
In a slumping division, this team hasn't taken charge as surely as its fans 
thought it would with its intellectual coach, belligerent quarterback, diligent 
general manager, Bill Polian, and its assortment of defensive stars -- Bruce 
Smith, Shane Conlan, Cornelius Bennett and others. They say in Buffalo that 
Kelly's talent has been diluted by abrasive relationships with teammates, but 
there's probably nothing wrong with the Bills that more consistency wouldn't 
cure. 
</P>
<P>
10) NEW YORK JETS 
</P>
<P>
QB: Ken O'Brien, Tony Eason 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bruce Coslet (first year) 
</P>
<P>
A new general manager, Dick Steinberg, has brought in a new coach from the Bill 
Walsh school. And although the Jets in a rebuilding year might be over their 
heads in other divisions, they can make a run for it in the East if either 
passer is up to it. Some NFL club executives are predicting that in time, 
Steinberg and the AFC's other new general managers -- Beathard and Kansas 
City's Carl Peterson among them -- will end the NFC's Super Bowl dominance. 
</P>
<P>
THE OTHERS 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WEST 
</P>
<P>
After Denver, San Diego, the Raiders and Kansas City line up one through four, 
there is only one place left for the Seattle Seahawks. It is improbable, 
though, that they'll actually finish fifth. Their coach, Chuck Knox, has a way 
of hanging tough against any odds, and his defense will improve when he gets in 
his first draft pick, flashy lineman Cortez Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
In Knox's offensive backfield, John L. Williams has the look of a run-and-shoot 
triple threat -- runner-receiver-blocker -- which is one reason the Seahawks 
may be in that formation more extensively than they now expect. 
</P>
<P>
Top to bottom, the AFC West has been called a strong division that would be one 
of the NFL's strongest if it had more quarterbacks of proven worth. The Elway 
contribution can be measured in one statistic: Of the AFC's 14 teams, the 
Broncos alone played in three 1980s Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Many scouts reason that the Chiefs and Chargers are set at most positions and, 
with Carl Peterson and Bobby Beathard rounding up talent, both soon may stand 
with the NFL's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL 
</P>
<P>
In this division last year, in one of the NFL's closest races of all time, 
Cleveland finished 9-6-1, Houston 9-7, Pittsburgh 9-7 and Cincinnati 8-8. It 
will come as no surprise to most in the AFC Central if the standings are the 
same this year -- or if they're just the reverse, with the Browns a half-game 
behind the others. 
</P>
<P>
Few NFL teams match the quality of the Cincinnati nucleus: blocker Anthony 
Munoz, receiver Eddie Brown, tight end Rodney Holman, runner James Brooks, 
passer Boomer Esiason, nose tackle Tim Krumrie and safety David Fulcher. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland quarterback Bernie Kosar will have a fourth offensive coordinator in 
four years, Jim Shofner. 
</P>
<P>
The primary AFC Central question is how much Warren Moon will shake things up 
in Houston's run and shoot, and the mystery team is Pittsburgh, which, to many 
AFC critics, seems to be on the way up again. But Pittsburgh's Brister is the 
least experienced quarterback in a division with three giants, Moon, Esiason 
and Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EAST 
</P>
<P>
Some of the NFL's most famous winners have come out of the franchises in this 
division -- the Jets with Joe Namath, the Dolphins with Bob Griese and Dan 
Marino, the Colts with John Unitas and Eric Dickerson, the Bills with O.J. 
Simpson, and, most recently, a New England Super Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
But to many in the AFC East, their division is in disarray -- although the 
Bills could still come back this year, and the Jets could come up. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Dan Marino keeps asking to be traded. Maybe he's saying something 
more. At 29, he's still the world's best passer. The question is whether Coach 
Don Shula, 60, has enough help besides receiver Mark Clayton and cornerback Tim 
McKyer. 
</P>
<P>
When the Colts drafted Jeff George last spring, they disclosed that they had 
the NFL's next great quarterback -- but he won't prove it this year. With Eric 
Dickerson out, Coach Ron Meyer has been left with not much but a linebacker, 
Duane Bickett, who can't run the ball or pass it. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots are stocked with above-average players, none of them at 
quarterback. Though well-coached by rookie Rod Rust, 61, they are unlikely to 
overtake anyone except Indianapolis.

<P>
In light of the chaos caused by the Buffalo Bills' unexpected no-huddle offense 
last week, Cleveland Brown Coach Bud Carson spent the week preparing for more 
of the same today from the Denver Broncos in the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bills found a couple weak spots, and they exploited them. We didn't do a 
very good job adjusting to them," Carson said. "They not only used a hurry-up 
game on us, they used an even more effective hurry-up game in that they weren't 
even audibling at the line of scrimmage. They were getting lined up and running 
plays quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's Jim Kelly passed for 405 yards and four touchdowns against Cleveland 
and nearly won the game before Clay Matthews intercepted a pass at the goal 
line with three seconds left to preserve the Browns' win. One play earlier, a 
potential touchdown pass glanced off the hands of Ronnie Harmon in the left 
corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's first touchdown came on a no-huddle play that created confusion among 
Cleveland's defenders. Matthews was feverishly trying to call a timeout as the 
ball was snapped, and Kelly proceeded to hit a wide-open Andre Reed over the 
middle for a 72-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
Though Denver attempted to use a hurry-up offense without much success in a 
16-13 loss to the Browns in Cleveland on Oct. 1, Carson said he'd be surprised 
if the Broncos didn't try of it today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anticipating 90,000 no-huddles. Our whole practice has been no-huddles," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns are seeking their first Super Bowl appearance. The Broncos are after 
their third appearance in four years and fourth overall. They are 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Denver had a 1,000-yard rusher and a 3,000-yard passer in the same season for 
the first time. Its attack is more balanced than Cleveland's. 
</P>
<P>
John Elway will supplement the passing game with Bobby Humphrey, who rushed for 
1,151 yards as a rookie and scored eight touchdowns. He is effective inside and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Elway did not have an outstanding season, but he did pass for 3,051 yards and 
18 touchdowns. He also threw 18 interceptions and was the team's third-leading 
rusher with 244 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's defensive backs excel at going for the ball -- the Browns led the 
AFC with 27 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The only snow fans at the game are likely to see will be capping the mountains 
in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast for today is mild and breezy, with increasing afternoon clouds and 
high temperatures in the low 50s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfect football weather," said weather service meteorologist Joe Baskin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cool enough for the players to enjoy it, and enough breeze to blow all 
the smoke out of the stands. Just a really nice day." 
</P>
<P>
Baskin said snow could follow on the heels of the game, however, perhaps on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe for the ticker-tape parade," he said.

<P>
If you were from Struthers, just outside Youngstown, Ohio, you didn't take to 
the folks from neighboring Boardman. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking the Hatfields and the McCoys here," said Jim Fox, a Boardman 
High School teacher. "The kids from Struthers always had something to prove to 
the rich kids from Boardman." 
</P>
<P>
"Boardman had a better band, better shopping malls, better everything than 
Struthers," said Chuck Perazich, sports editor of the Youngstown Vindicator. 
"Except for sports -- when it came to sports, you never knew who was going to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"In sports it was the cake-eaters from Boardman, against the blue-collar tough 
guys from Struthers. Bitter rivals," Perazich said. "That's why I imagine 
(Chargers' defensive coordinator) Ronnie Lynn has got to have a funny feeling 
about this game. I got to believe he's going to try a little harder. After all, 
he's from Struthers." 
</P>
<P>
And Bernie Kosar is from Boardman. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar also is the starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns (1-1), and 
today in front of a sellout crowd of 80,000 he will match brawn and wits with 
Lynn's not-so-neighborly Charger defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known the guy for a long time," Lynn said. "His high school adviser (Fox) 
was my college roommate. I even tried to recruit Bernie to play at Cal." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar went on to prosper for the University of Miami, but today Lynn will be 
coming after him again. And he won't be alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie knows he's going to get the good pass rush, maybe the great pass rush," 
Cleveland coach Bud Carson said. "Maybe the best in the AFC." 
</P>
<P>
This cannot be good news for Kosar. In two games, he has been sacked 10 times; 
on 10 other occasions, he has released the ball and then has been decked. Four 
of his passes have been deflected by pass rushers. 
</P>
<P>
He wears an elastic wrap around a painted black plastic cup used to protect the 
elbow on his throwing arm, Maybe he should be padded from head to foot. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely a tough guy," linebacker Gary Plummer said. "As much as he's 
been knocked around in the last two weeks to still be standing -- you got to 
admire the guy." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, however, do not come to Cleveland Stadium to praise Kosar. They 
come "to bury him," as defensive tackle Lee Williams pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the target," Williams said. "We know where he's going to be, and we're 
coming after him. Full throttle." 
</P>
<P>
Protected by an offensive line that doesn't make the Chargers' offensive line 
look so bad anymore, Kosar has struggled to be effective, and as a result, 
Cleveland's offense ranks 26th in the NFL. The Browns feature four new starters 
up front, and to hear the folks in Cleveland, they'd be just as happy to go to 
war with the four old starters. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Browns seven quarters of play to record their first offensive 
touchdown this season. They now have two. Their longest run from scrimmage has 
been 16 yards by Kevin Mack, who is now sidelined with a broken finger; their 
longest pass play is 27 yards, to Reggie Langhorne. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had their problems, and they may do some things to keep extra 
protectors in there for Bernie," Lynn said. "But we're going to rush him. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie's a courageous guy. But he may throw some away, and if you get hit a 
number of times, I don't care how tough you are, you start to hurt and flinch. 
I can see some of that happening if we do what we're capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
Now if the Browns are capable of doing what they do best, then nobody scores, 
and these two teams go into overtime for the third time in their last five 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Chargers, the Browns try to construct a victory via defense. Their 
head coach is a former defensive coordinator, who was the architect of 
Pittsburgh's "Steel Curtain." Their big-play linebacker, Clay Matthews, has 
been to five Pro Bowls. Their top pass rusher, Michael Dean Perry, leads the 
AFC in sacks, with four. 
</P>
<P>
In two games, they have yet to surrender a second-half touchdown, and as the 
Chargers are often reminded, they have yet to score in either the third or 
fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I know. I know," quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said. "I'm sure they've got to 
feel pretty good about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're looking to change that. Not necessarily to score in the fourth 
quarter, but to score if we need to score. That's our goal." 
</P>
<P>
Bring on Fuad Reveiz. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the blindfold?" said the Charger kicker, whose job is on the line. 
"Coach (Dan) Henning hasn't made it easy for me putting me on the spot like 
this, but it's something that is part of the business." 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz, one-for-three in field-goal attempts, has been informed that future 
employment with the Chargers rests solely on how he does today. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be panicking after two games," Reveiz said. "You've got a lot of the 
season to go, and you can't be looking after two games and think it's the end 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but an 0-3 start would be the first for the Chargers since going 
0-11 in 1975. It would also put an end to all those high-flying expectations 
that greeted a fifth-place schedule and Bobby Beathard's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The last time, however, the Chargers sought victory in the Browns' ramshackle 
backyard, they were waylaid, 47-17. 
</P>
<P>
"We got no allies there," Lynn said. "We're gonna be warming up in front of the 
'Dawg Pound' (the dog bone-tossing section of Browns fans), and they'll be 
throwing things at us and calling us everything but free men. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an avid fan, a rabid fan. This is important to the people in Cleveland. 
These are the guys who come out of the mills wearing hard hats who just don't 
take them off Friday till Sunday. They live for their football. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean I got a ticket for my college roommate," Lynn said, "and he's rooting 
for Bernie."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, the New York Jets waived Freeman McNeil, the team's 
all-time leading rusher with 7,146 yards. 
</P>
<P>
When the former UCLA standout went unclaimed by another team, the Jets brought 
McNeil back for his 10th season. 
</P>
<P>
The move paid off Sunday against the Cleveland Browns as McNeil rushed for 62 
yards and caught three passes for 80 yards as the Jets beat the Browns, 24-21, 
to give Bruce Coslet his first victory as the team's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Freeman's too old," Coslet said with a big smile creasing his face after his 
successful home debut. "He can't do it anymore. You saw that." 
</P>
<P>
McNeil has been a starter in both of the Jets' games this season because Blair 
Thomas -- the Jets' No. 1 draft pick -- has been slowed by a hamstring injury, 
and Johnny Hector is just approaching peak shape after arthroscopic knee 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil and quarterback Ken O'Brien connected on a 59-yard pass play in the 
first quarter that was the longest of McNeil's career. He ran all the way to 
the one and Brad Baxter got the touchdown two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets' defense was stingy in the first half and pressured Bernie Kosar 
throughout the game. Cleveland, which had only 80 yards rushing last week, was 
limited to 44 against the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar completed 24 of 41 passes for 233 yards. O'Brien completed 13 of 21 
passes for 218 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns (1-1) got off to a fast start when Eric Metcalf returned the opening 
kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But the Jets (1-1) came right back with a 68-yard, four-play drive highlighted 
by Thomas' 55-yard run with a screen pass that set up McNeil's two-yard scoring 
run. 
</P>
<P>
New York went ahead, 14-7, with a 90-yard drive that took just six plays. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Thomas was a key figure with a 25-yard run. On the next play, Anthony 
Blaylock was called for pass interference at the Cleveland 27. 
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Hector scored from the six. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Leahy added a 47-yard field goal after the Jets recovered a Metcalf fumble, 
giving the Jets a 17-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised at how they came back after Eric's touchdown," Browns 
Coach Bud Carson said.

BILLS' DISCORD IS MUSIC TO THE EARS OF BROWNS

All anybody here seems to want to talk about is an anticipated showdown for the 
AFC championship next week between the Cleveland Browns and the Denver Broncos, 
who twice in the last three years kept the Browns out of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Up first for the Browns, however, are the embattled Buffalo Bills, their 
opponents today in an AFC playoff game at Municipal Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The underdog Bills (9-7) staggered into the postseason, losing three 
consecutive games before closing the season with a 37-0 rout of the New York 
Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Kelly, whose abrasiveness was tolerated when the Bills were at 
their best, has been criticized by the fans, the media and his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
And in an even more surprising development, Kelly has raised questions about 
his confidence, once thought to be unshakable. 
</P>
<P>
In-fighting among the Bills started in the second week of the season, when 
Kelly exchanged words with a receiver who was later released, and heated up 
three weeks later, when Kelly suffered a separated left shoulder in a 37-14 
loss to the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference the next day, Kelly blamed the injury on a missed block by 
tackle Howard Ballard. Angering his teammates further, Kelly also said that 
Ballard was the weak link in the Bills' offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, while watching a videotape of a 34-3 victory over the Jets, 
assistant coaches Nick Nicolau and Tom Bresnahan got into a fistfight. Nicolau 
reportedly punched Bresnahan, opening a cut on his chin, and also drove 
Bresnahan's head through a plasterboard wall, opening a cut on his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly returned after being sidelined for three games, leading the Bills to a 
24-7 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 12 that established the Bills 
among the elite in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
All seemed well, or well enough. 
</P>
<P>
But after Kelly played poorly the next week in a 17-16 loss at Seattle, running 
back Thurman Thomas told a cable television audience that quarterback was the 
Bills' weak link. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after Kelly saw three of his passes intercepted the next week in a 22-19 
loss to the New Orleans Saints, Kelly was asked if his confidence had been 
shaken. 
</P>
<P>
"You might say that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he was pulled aside for a pep talk by Coach Marv Levy, who had 
always defended Kelly's brashness, calling it more than mere bravado. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly threw three more interceptions in a 21-10 loss to the San Francisco 
49ers, but none in the romp over the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Asked this week about the bickering among the Bills, Levy said: "That's behind 
us, and I'm not talking about it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Browns (9-6-1) endured hard times of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Or some did, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bernie Kosar has weathered his most trying season, being asked to 
lead an offense that was without Kevin Mack, the Browns' leading rusher in each 
of the previous five seasons, for all but the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
When Kosar was pulled in the fourth quarter of a 21-0 loss to the Bengals in 
Week 13, the Browns had scored 37 points in four games. 
</P>
<P>
In a poll conducted the next week by a Buffalo TV station, only 51% of the 
record 28,500 respondents said they favored Kosar as the Browns' quarterback 
over his backup, journeyman Mike Pagel. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar, who has led the Browns into the playoffs in each of his five NFL 
seasons, was angered by the lack of support from the fans and also was troubled 
by Coach Bud Carson's refusal to support him publicly. Carson didn't announce 
his starter for the next week's game against the Colts until moments before the 
kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
Carson later claimed he was only trying to keep the Colts guessing and that 
Kosar's job never was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reasoning, Kosar threw for 353 yards against the Colts. But the 
Browns lost, 23-17, when Mike Prior intercepted a pass by Kosar in overtime and 
returned it 58 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Winless in four games, the Browns then closed the season with victories over 
the Minnesota Vikings, 23-17 in overtime, and the Houston Oilers, 24-20. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, jailed for a drug conviction during most of the season, then suffered a 
knee injury. He gained 27 of his 62 yards in the game-winning drive against the 
Oilers, scoring on a four-yard run with 39 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Browns were AFC Central champions. 
</P>
<P>
Only a more troubled team stands between them and another AFC title game.

THE DRIVE FINALLY GOES THE BROWNS' WAY, 30-29

Quarterback Bernie Kosar finally turned the tables on the team that has so 
often tormented him, leading Cleveland to 10 points in the final 3:21 and a 
30-29 victory over the Denver Broncos Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The winning points came on Jerry Kauric's 30-yard field goal as time expired 
after a 48-yard drive engineered by Kosar. A few minutes earlier, Kosar had 
completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Brian Brennan that cut a 29-20 deficit to 
29-27. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns had scored only three offensive touchdowns in their four previous 
games. But Kosar completed 24 of 38 passes for 318 yards and three touchdowns 
against the Broncos and could have had a fourth. A five-yard flip to Eric 
Metcalf for a touchdown was ruled a lateral and scored as a rushing touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (2-3) ended a three-game losing streak that had left Coach Bud 
Carson's job in jeopardy. It came against a team that had beaten the Browns 
three times in the last four AFC title games. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say one game is the season, but if we had lost we would have been so 
far in the cellar we couldn't have dug ourselves out," said cornerback Frank 
Minnifield, who ended his holdout last week and had an interception Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"This meant a lot to a lot of people," Kosar said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost a 'must' win for us." 
</P>
<P>
Denver (2-3), which suffered five turnovers in a loss to Buffalo last week, 
took advantage of two Cleveland turnovers to overcome a 20-19 deficit early in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Kosar. He completed a 24-yard pass to Vernon Joines on fourth and two 
from midfield, then threw his third touchdown pass of the game, a 24-yarder to 
Brennan with 3:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
The final drive started with 2:04 left. Kosar completed passes of 15 yards to 
Joines, 20 to Reggie Langhorne and 15 to Brennan on a third-and-eight play to 
set up the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of heat on the team this year, and to come back in the 
fourth period the way we did is a tribute to a lot of guys," Carson said.

BROWNS SHOOT BLANKS IN BATTLE OF OHIO; 
</P>
<P>
CINCINNATI: IT HANDS CLEVELAND ITS FIRST SHUTOUT AT HOME SINCE 1977.

The Cincinnati Bengals didn't realize how badly things were going for the 
Cleveland Browns until they saw it in person Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would have told me that we would shut out the Browns, I would have said 
it was impossible," Cincinnati receiver Tim McGee said after catching four 
passes, including one on a 38-yard touchdown pass play, as the Bengals blanked 
Cleveland, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, McGee hadn't been paying attention to the Browns' offensive problems 
in recent weeks. Their three-game total of 20 points is the lowest for any 
three-game span in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's shutout was Cleveland's first at home since 1977, and it came against 
a Bengal team that hadn't blanked anyone since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense lately has not been playing up to its potential," Cincinnati 
linebacker Reggie Williams said. "This week, we managed to turn it around. We 
got some hits on Bernie Kosar early in the game. When you do that, it can be a 
long day for the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar was benched after three quarters, more because of his ineffectiveness 
than his sore right elbow. Kosar, who completed 15 of 30 passes for 130 yards, 
hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in 14 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It starts with the quarterback, and I want to take responsibility for the 
football team," said Kosar, who bruised his elbow three weeks ago in Seattle. 
"I was disappointed. But I don't play the coach, and that's their decision to 
make. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple hits out there and the arm was a little sore, but I don't 
think it was anything of any significance." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar, who was warming his elbow on the sidelines between possessions because 
of the 18-degree temperature and minus-10 wind chill factor, was booed heartily 
by the sellout crowd of 76,236 throughout the third quarter. The stands were 
nearly empty by late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati quarterback Boomer Esiason completed 14 of 32 passes for 197 yards 
with two touchdowns and two interceptions as the Bengals (7-6) put themselves 
back in the AFC Central Division race, one game behind Houston (8-5) and a half 
game behind the Browns (7-5-1). 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Bengals their first two-game sweep in the annual "battle 
for Ohio" since 1984. Cincinnati beat Cleveland, 21-14, Sept. 25 at Cincinnati.

4 QUARTERBACKS, 1 SUPER BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN MURRAY, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the time of year that can make or break a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Bradshaw couldn't spell "cat" until he starred in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Simms was never good enough in New York until he was perfect in a Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Williams never got the payday he deserved until he broke down barriers in 
a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
If this is January, then the NFL spotlight must be on the quarterback. Heading 
into the AFC and NFC championship games, this year's roll call of Final Four 
quarterbacks is typical of the times. 
</P>
<P>
There's Bernie Kosar and John Elway -- the unorthodox, side-arming flinger 
against the once golden boy -- in Sunday's AFC showdown between Cleveland and 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
There's Jim Everett and Joe Montana -- the new kid on the block against the 
master -- in the NFC's matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in that group is a Super Bowl winner: if it's Montana, a repeat 
winner, waiting the call of fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Elway and Montana know a little about the territory. Elway is a two-time Super 
Bowl loser with the Broncos, born of expectations that at times have been 
surrealistic. Montana is a three-time winner whose former coach was ready to 
phase him out as recently as November 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, of the four, only Everett has not been drummed through the NFL's school 
of hard knocks. Kosar was booed this season in Cleveland. All he did was win 
four division titles in five years as a pro. Elway was booed in Denver. All he 
did was win a pair of AFC championships. 
</P>
<P>
"There (were) some unpleasant things said and John hasn't had an easy year," 
said Dan Reeves, Elway's coach in Denver. "But he has performed well, and he 
showed last week he still is able to do great things." 
</P>
<P>
Elway, 29, became the third player in NFL history to have five straight 
3,000-yard seasons. Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason are the others. Counting last 
week's come-from-behind win over Pittsburgh, he has brought the Broncos back 16 
times with last-minute rallies. It was Elway's crucial 36-yard completion to 
Vance Johnson on a flea-flicker that set up the Broncos' winning touchdown in a 
24-23 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
If there's one thing Marty Schottenheimer appreciates in Elway, it's his 
competitive fire. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about his mobility and strong arm, the one thing people fail to 
recognize is that he probably is as great a competitor as there is," said 
Schottenheimer, head coach in Kansas City who lost two AFC title games to Elway 
while in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I've coached him in the Pro Bowl, and I've seen enough of him to know the guy 
is a great competitor. And if you look at all four of these quarterbacks, 
that's one common thread they all have." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar's competitiveness helped him endure a year of insult and injury in 
Cleveland. The Browns' quarterback bruised his right elbow in a Week 10 victory 
over Seattle. He played through the pain, and in the next four games the Browns 
went 0-3-1. When he went 20 quarters without a touchdown pass, he was booed at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask Bernie how he is, he won't ever say he's hurting," said Bud Carson, 
who replaced Schottenheimer in Cleveland. "But we've discussed it with the 
doctors and they say he isn't in any career-threatening situation. He just has 
had some different arm problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When the time comes to throw the ball, especially in a big game when we have 
to have it, Bernie comes through. We were much more concerned about him last 
week, health-wise, than this week." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar, 26, has had elbow, shoulder and finger ailments this year. Last week, 
with various parts of his anatomy hurting, he completed 20 of 29 passes for 235 
yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Despite the injuries, Kosar still 
passed for 3,533 yards and 18 touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't surprise Schottenheimer. "The thing that stands out is that at a 
point in time when everybody thought he would be at his worst, he got the job 
done," his former coach said. "That speaks volumes about Kosar as a winning 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
At a point in time when then-coach Bill Walsh was ready to pass the 49ers' 
quarterbacking torch from Montana to Steve Young last season, Montana responded 
with some of the best football of his life. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers won seven of their last eight games a year ago, and with Montana 
showing the way, capped the season with a dramatic 20-16 victory over 
Cincinnati in Super Bowl XXIII. His 92-yard drive at game's end produced the 
winning touchdown, a 10-yard scoring pass to John Taylor. This year, the 49ers 
are 15-2 going into Sunday's showdown, and Montana has elevated his game still 
another notch. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, 33, completed a staggering 70.2 percent of his passes this season and 
posted the highest passer rating in NFL history, 112.4. His 
touchdown-to-interception ratio of 26-8 is the best of his 11-year career. 
Montana was named the NFL's MVP for his superior season. 
</P>
<P>
Said first-year 49ers Coach George Seifert, "Any superlative you can use to 
describe him fits." 
</P>
<P>
Montana's next playoff touchdown pass will tie him with Bradshaw for the league 
record of 30. 
</P>
<P>
As fate would have it, there are those who compare young Everett to the veteran 
Montana. In his second full season as the Rams' starting quarterback, Everett 
passed for 4,310 yards and an NFL-high 29 touchdowns. He has a strong arm, 
quick release and soft touch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great compliment," Everett said of the comparison. "He (Montana) has 
proven time and time again he's a Super Bowl winner, and I think that's the 
judgment on quarterbacks. Comparisons are great, but I don't have a Super 
Bowl."

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Sports: Mediocrity's the Word Around NFL </HL>
<AUTHOR> Frederick C. Klein </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> Denver  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politics has its Misery Index, which combines unemployment and inflation to gauge how well or poorly off we the people are. 
A similar measure can be applied to the National Football League. 
Call it the Mediocrity Index, if you will. 
It measures how many teams are within a game of .500, a workable definition of the common stew. 

   A perusal of the standings at the cessation of hostilities Sunday revealed 11 of the 28 NFL teams to have been mediocre after 11 weeks, sporting won-lost records of 6-5, 5-5-1, 5-5 or 5-6. 
If that figure holds for the season as a whole, it would be the third highest of this decade, trailing only 1983's 16 and 1981's 12. 
That would make it a better than fair-to-middling year for mediocrity. 

   As the winter winds begin to sting the nose, the identity of the mediocre is as interesting as their number. 
The rank includes the defending Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins, who were embearrassed on Sunday by Chicago, 34-14, in their own park, to drop their record to 6-5 and imperil their chances for a repeat. 

   The ever-popular San Francisco 49ers find unexpected mediocrity gravy on their jerseys as a result of a Sunday beating by their old neighbors, the Los Angeles Raiders. 
Four of the five teams in the American Conference's Eastern Division qualify. 
So do the Seattle Seahawks, who haven't been getting their Boz-worth out of their much-injured linebacker, Brian. 

   But whether your MI glass is half full or half empty depends on your perspective. 
The Denver Broncos, party of the second part in the past two Super Bowls, were smiling ear-to-ear over their 6-5 record at dusk here Sunday, while the Cleveland Browns were in the dumps over the same numbers. 
That's because the Broncos had just gobbled up a plateful of turnovers to dump the Browns, 30-7, and boost their playoff hopes at the Browns' expense. 

   The last time these two teams met, the only "m" word anyone was using was "marvelous." 
That was last season's AFC championship game in Mile High Stadium. 
The Broncs won it, 38-33, but not before the Browns had come back from a 21-3 deficit and were an Earnest Byner stride from a tying, last-minute touchdown before a fumble thwarted them. 
Given the run of recent Super Bowls, it wouldn't have been a bad idea to end the season right there and decide the league champ by ballot. 
Alas, they played the thing, and Washington beat the Broncs in a 42-10 ho-hummer. 

   Cleveland impressed enough to become a lot of people's pre-season title choice, and to put its tall quarterback, Bernie Kosar, on many a magazine cover. 
Storky Bernie, however, was casualty No. 1 in this year's quarterback injury plague by sustaining a sprained knee in game one, and spent the next six leaning on crutches while his mates relied on stout defense (the best in the conference before Sunday) to acquire a 4-3 mark. 

   Kosar returned on Oct. 23 and led two victories, causing the Lake Erie faithful to joyfully conclude that all was well. 
But the bad-boy Houston Oilers whopped the Browns country-style a week ago Monday night, and the Broncos followed suit Sunday. 

   Not surprisingly, the supposed after-effects of the bruising administered by the Oilers came up frequently in the losers' dressing room here. 
Cleveland coach Marty Schottenheimer declared it had "absolutely nothing" to do with the latest setback, but some of his troops demurred. 
"We could have been a little drawn out from that game," said defensive end Carl Hairston. 
"They hit pretty hard." 

   The situation on the Broncos' side was a bit different. 
This gang had managed to retain a scrappy, underdog image while compiling the AFC's best regular-season record over the 1983-87 campaigns (54-24-1) and winning conference titles the past two years. 
But, perhaps surrendering to angst, they came out flat early this season and lost three of their first four. 

   Three wins perked things up, but the team surrendered 94 points in losses to Pittsburgh (!) and Indianapolis, and had all it could do to edge a Kansas City Chiefs team that's so bad it has been denounced on the editorial page of the Kansas City Times. (Danders up, the Chiefs beat the 8-2 Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. 
That's the kind of season it's been.) 

   "I don't know the reasons, but we weren't playing together the first couple months of this season. 
Nothing much was in synch," confirms veteran Denver guard Keith Bishop. 

   So unpromising was the Broncos' outlook (and so porous their worst-in-the-league defense against the run) that they entered Sunday's fray a three-point underdog even though they'd beaten the Browns nine straight times going back to 1974. 
Cleveland's game plan was to run straight at the Broncos' 260-pound defensive linemen, who are teeny weeny by NFL standards. 
Fullback Tim Manoa got the first call. 

   But -- oops! -- Bronco nose tackle Greg Kragen butted the ball from Manoa's hands, defensive back Dennis Smith recovered on the Cleveland 22-yard line and, in the course of time, a Rich Karlis field goal gave Denver a 3-0 lead. 
The Broncos possessed the ball six times in the first half -- four times on Cleveland turnovers -- and each time they scored. 
The Browns went oh-for-seven, and took their half-time ease on the short end of a 30-0 count. 

   The second half was pro forma, with the Denver fans amusing themselves by floating paper airplanes onto the field and the Broncos finding sport in chasing Kosar, who runs like he's on stilts. 
They caught him six times, for 35 yards in losses. 

   As usual, the Denver offensive star was quarterback John Elway, who flipped, zipped and darted as in days of yore, which is to say last year. 
It was, he said later, "a good win, maybe one we can build on. 
It was nice to have a cushion for a change." 

   In the Browns' boudoir, veteran tight end Ozzie Newsome was saying that, perhaps, adversity would rally his team where high hopes had failed. 
"Maybe we'll circle the wagons, like the cowboys did when the Indians attacked," he said. 
I considered telling him about Custer, but thought better of it.

Only a decade ago, defensive coaches in the National Football League were a lot 
like Dan Quayle -- fine in their place but not generally considered chief 
executive officer material. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1979 we went to (Ray) Perkins as the head coach," New York Giants General 
Manager George Young said. "He was an offensive coordinator, one of the golden 
boys. (Bill) Walsh, (Joe) Gibbs and later (Dan) Reeves and (Mike) Ditka were 
the guys people were hiring. At the time, the defensive coaches in the league 
did not think they had a chance of becoming head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Boy Syndrome, as Young calls it, no longer prevails. Now, the 
league's owners are increasingly turning their teams over to defensive wizards. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's 28 head coaches are split; 14 are offensive specialists and 14 are 
defensive specialists. But of the six newcomers this season, five have a 
defensive resume. Three teams -- the Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions and San 
Francisco 49ers -- made the switch from offense to defense. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are prevailing circumstances surrounding most new hires (for 
instance, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was the roommate of Coach Jimmy 
Johnson at the University of Arkansas), defense has become fashionable again in 
the fickle NFL. 
</P>
<P>
The laundry list: Johnson, Dallas; Marty Schottenheimer, Kansas City; Wayne 
Fontes, Detroit; George Seifert, San Francisco; Bud Carson, Cleveland Browns; 
Dan Henning, San Diego Chargers. Only Henning has extensive experience on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"In the NFL, we copy success and believe in reincarnation," said Ernie Accorsi, 
Cleveland's executive vice president of football operations. "That's why so 
many of Vince Lombardi's assistants were hired over the years. That's why 
people are loading up on defense after the (Chicago) Bears and Giants won the 
Super Bowl. It's true with players and it's true with coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Accorsi says he interviewed seven defensive coordinators after Schottenheimer 
was fired over philosophical differences with owner Art Modell. With a 
successful quarterback, offensive coordinator and receivers coach already on 
board, Accorsi wanted to maintain offensive continuity. 
</P>
<P>
Most team executives interviewed for this story said that offensive or 
defensive expertise meant less than the character of the individual coach. 
However, most agreed that the bias toward offense that existed early in the 
1980s has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling has never changed," Young said. "You have to run and play defense. 
Sure, there's a trend there, but it comes down to the individual. There were 
some non-football people at the beginning of the decade who thought getting an 
offensive coordinator, a fancy passing game, would solve everything. 
</P>
<P>
"The myth has been exploded. (Don) Shula, (Tom) Landry, (Chuck) Noll, (Weeb) 
Ewbank ... they all came from defense, but people forgot about it because that 
was a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to open up the game, the NFL liberalized pass-blocking rules in 
1977 and 1978. The immediate result was more points. The long-term effect was a 
new premium on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Overmatched by offenses, defenses were forced to respond. As teams began to 
become more aggressive through blitzing in 1983, defensive touchdowns increased 
sharply as offensive touchdowns began to decline. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, 1983 was the year two defensive coordinators were elevated to 
head coaching jobs by their teams, Bill Parcells with the Giants and Marion 
Campbell with the Philadelphia Eagles. Just after the announcements had been 
made following the 1982 season, the two men met at the Senior Bowl in Mobile, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure on us," Campbell told Parcells. "A lot of defensive 
guys are looking to us. If we fail, they'll never get hired." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Carsons and Seiferts of the world, Parcells and Campbell 
made generally favorable impressions. At the same time, some of the league's 
defenses began to emerge as dominant. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a finesse label traceable to Walsh and quarterback Joe Montana, the San 
Francisco team that capped the 1984 season by winning Super Bowl XIX had a 
ruthless defense directed by Seifert. The Chicago Bears of 1985 allowed three 
playoff opponents a ridiculous total of 10 points on the way to victory in 
Super Bowl XX. The Giants' savage defense was a chief factor in a 17-2 season, 
including a victory in Super Bowl XXI. 
</P>
<P>
And so, owners were not afraid to give defensive coaches a chance. Chicago 
defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan accepted the Eagles' head coaching job Jan. 
29, 1986, three days after his defense shredded the New England Patriots in the 
ultimate game. He has prospered in Philadelphia and last season gave the Eagles 
their first division title in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Following that 1986 season, the Houston Oilers promoted defensive coordinator 
Jerry Glanville and the New Orleans Saints hired Jim Mora, a successful U.S. 
Football League coach who once served as the Patriots' defensive coordinator. 
Gene Stallings, Landry's defensive backs coach for 14 seasons in Dallas, was 
the choice of the St. Louis Cardinals. Glanville and Mora, who have led their 
teams to the playoffs, are considered saviors in their respective areas. 
</P>
<P>
This past off-season brought more turnover than usual at the top of NFL teams. 
Walsh and Landry retired, and Schottenheimer, Kansas City's Frank Gansz, 
Detroit's Darryl Rogers and San Diego's Al Saunders were all fired. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hire Marty just because he was a defensive coach," said Carl 
Peterson, Kansas City's general manager and chief operating officer. "But you 
win with defense. It's logic. If you can build a good defense, you always have 
a chance to win. I've always believed that. That's why I hired Jim Mora for the 
(Philadelphia) Stars (of the USFL)." 
</P>
<P>
Carson, the creative defensive coordinator of the New York Jets, was the first 
choice of the Browns. Accorsi was impressed with Carson's knowledge of offense. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been defensing offenses for years," Accorsi said. "He knows which 
offensive schemes give him the most trouble and how to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea that an offensive guy is that different from a defensive guy is 
the most overblown, ridiculous theory. People think they're different sports. 
Look at Shula and Landry ... they were defensive guys and they were still 
calling the plays on the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
Carson devotes 100 percent of his time to defense, something evident in 
Cleveland's 51-0 bombing of the Pittsburgh Steelers in last week's opener. He 
is content to let Marc Trestman, who tutored starter Bernie Kosar as well as 
Jim Kelly and Vinny Testaverde at the University of Miami, run the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Fontes was the defensive coordinator under John McKay at Tampa Bay, but when he 
was passed over in favor of Leeman Bennett on McKay's retirement, he joined the 
Lions in 1985. When Rogers was fired with five games left last season, Fontes 
was named interim coach. He was retained by owner William Clay Ford because he 
won as many games as Rogers (two) in six fewer tries. 
</P>
<P>
One of Fontes' first acts was hiring Mouse Davis, creator of the run-and-shoot 
offense, as his offensive coordinator. Although it is too early to call, 
Detroit is more likely to win games with its young defense this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Fontes might never have gotten the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Saying that defensive guys can't be head coaches is like saying men make 
better engineers than women," Young said. "It's only because you see more men 
as engineers. Now that more women are in the field that mold has been broken. 
That's what's happening with defensive coaches in the NFL." 
</P>

   ABC television will try to soothe bruised
feelings in Cleveland stemming from a joke in a promotion for the
situation comedy ``Coach,'' the mayor's office says.
   Robert A. Iger, president of ABC Entertainment, promised to air
an apology the night of Oct. 22, when ABC broadcasts the Cleveland
Browns' home game against the Cincinnati Bengals, a statement by
Mayor Michael R. White's office said Saturday.
   When the Browns played in Denver against the Broncos on Oct. 8,
the network broadcast a brief promotion for ``Coach.''
   Actor Jerry Van Dyke, who plays an assistant college football
coach on the series, commented that even if the Browns beat Denver,
they would still lose ``because they have to go back to
Cleveland.''
   White sent a letter to ABC, calling the remark insensitive and
disrespectful to the city.
   ``Any comedian or comedy show that uses Cleveland as the punch
line for a joke has never visited our city and is relying on what
has been for years the crutch of feeble comedians,'' White said in
his letter to ABC.
   Iger's letter explained that Van Dyke's joke was done ``in
character'' and that no malice was intended. Iger noted that two
weeks earlier, during a Monday Night Football broadcast, Van Dyke
made the same comment about Buffalo, N.Y.
   ``We firmly believe this incident should be kept in the proper
perspective, and given the problems existing in the world today, we
urge you and the citizens of your fine city to take this in the
lighthearted spirit in which it was meant,'' Iger wrote.

Bernie and the Brown in the Pink

<TEXT>
   The Federal Communication Commission well might consider taking legal action against the Cleveland Browns for misleading labeling. 
A team named the Browns has no business playing exciting football. 
The Cleveland Magentas or Aquamarines, maybe. 
But never the Browns. 

   No team named the Browns, for instance, should be able to rally from a 20-10 deficit with just over four minutes left to win a double-overtime, 23-20, victory, but that's what the Clevelanders did against the New York Jets here Saturday in an American Football Conference semifinal that had more climaxes than a Jackie Collins novel. 
Even some of the winners expressed surprise at the outcome. 

   "When we were down near the end, Bernie Kosar {the Browns' quarterback} told us not to worry, that we still had time to get it done," said Cody Risien, a veteran offensive tackle. 
"My heart said 'Yeah,' but my mind found it hard to believe." 

   So, too, did the 23-year-old Kosar, in his mind of minds. 
"Things looked bleak," he admitted in a post-game interview. 
Then again, "this team has character, and if there's a way to win, I knew we'd find it," said he. 

   Thus, the Browns will find themselves in the AFC final here Sunday against the winner of yesterday's late-afternoon Denver-New England game. 
That's the furthest they've gone in the NFL post-season tournament since 1969. 
They have had five other shots at playoff glory since then, but all have come up ashes. 
The one that hurt most came six years ago minus a day when, trailing Oakland 14-12 in below-zero weather here, their drive for a winning score was thwarted within hand-shaking distance of the goal line by an interception of a poorly advised pass by quarterback Brian Sipe. 

   The shade of that defeat haunted ramshackle Municipal Stadium on Saturday. 
"No Red-Right-88" read a fan's sign in footballese reference to that ill-fated play. 
And -- hey! -- it was "deja vu" time in the fourth quarter, when, with his team at the Jets' two-yard line and trailing 13-10, Kosar flipped a little pass into the waiting arms of Jet cornerback Russell Carter. 

   This, however, is 1987, not '81, and the 6-foot-5 Kosar isn't the shortish Sipe. 
Bernie, you might recall, was the Vinny Testaverde of 1984, leading the University of Miami team to national recognition. 
In fact, if it wasn't for Kosar's leaving the sheltering palms for the pros two years before his college eligibility ran out (he actually graduated early), Vinny might never have had his chance to shine. 

   Kosar is an Ohio boy who wanted to play for the Browns, and the team was so flattered it traded about everything but its yard-line markers to Buffalo for his draft rights. 
Last season was his first, and the team protected his tender psyche with a heavily run-oriented attack. 

   Kosar appreciates offensive balance ("I don't want to throw 50 times a game," he told his coaches), but the scanty rookie employment of his arm chafed. 
This season he has been allowed to throw more, and the Browns have prospered. 
Their 12-4 won-lost record in the regular campaign compares to 8-8 last season, and gives them the home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. 

   On Saturday, however, Brown balance went out the window in the direction of the pass. 
Thwarted by the Jets' sturdy rushing defense until the overtime periods, Kosar set team records for passing attempts (64) and yards (489), and tied one for completions (33). 
In one third-quarter stretch, the Browns attempted to pass on 16 consecutive offensive plays, not including kicks. 

   Such one-sidedness bodes ill for the team's outlook in the games ahead, as Kosar well knows. 
"We did what worked today, but we wouldn't like to make a habit" of all that passing, he allowed. 

   The Browns also wouldn't like to make a habit of squandering scoring chances the way they did during this strange afternoon. 
They visited Jets' territory on 13 of their 18 ball possessions, but were able to score just five times, on two touchdowns and three field goals. 

   That was partly the fault of placekicker Mark Moseley, who missed on three of his six field-goal tries. 
One of those misses -- from just 23 yards in the first overtime -- provoked a moan from the 78,000 Brownie faithful that could have caused a seiche on Lake Erie. 
But the old-fashioned toe-firster got the winner, a 27-yarder, two minutes into OT II. 

   The real drama of the game came in the last period of regulation, though. 
The gutsy, opportunistic Jets went into the quarter ahead 13-10, and made it 20-10 with 4:14 remaining on a 25-yard run by Freeman McNeil on their first play from scrimmage after their second interception of a Kosar pass. 
Things looked browner yet for the Browns after a couple of penalties put them in a second-and-24 situation from their own 18. 

   A questionable roughing-the-passer penalty on Jets lineman Mark Gastineau got them out of that hole, however, and starting on third-and-10 from his own 33 Kosar completed six straight passes for a touchdown with 1:57 left. 
The Browns stopped the Jets on downs and took over again at their 33 with 51 seconds and no timeouts left. 
A pass interference penalty advanced the ball 25 yards and Kosar hit Webster Slaughter for 37 more to the 5. 
Moseley's 22-yard field goal tied it at 20 with 11 seconds to go. 

   In the overtime, the Browns did what they couldn't do before, which is run the ball. 
Forty five of their 75 yards rushing for the day came on their winning drive. 
"We kept dialing the same number 'til someone answered," said weary lineman Risien. 

   The day, however, was Kosar's, and everyone knew it. 
"BERNIE 1:25:87" read a balcony sign. 
That's the date of Super Bowl XXI (1/25/87), not one of those ubiquitous biblical citations. 
But if Bernie gets the Browns to Pasadena, he'll be Saint Bernard hereabouts.

Nick Lowery rarely misses, but he doesn't often kick on the sloppy turf in 
Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, one of the most accurate kickers in history, missed two long field 
goals in the final four seconds of regulation and another with three seconds 
left in overtime Sunday as the Kansas City Chiefs and the Cleveland Browns 
played to a 10-10 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough stadium to kick in," Lowery said. "The last kick in overtime 
was like trying to kick out of a sand trap." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Stadium has a grass field that take nearly a year-round beating from 
football and baseball, so the footing is rarely good. 
</P>
<P>
Any moisture makes it a mess. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sandy in places and muddy in other places," said Cleveland's Matt Bahr, 
who made a 40-yarder in the first half. "You've even got turf seams. You never 
know what you're going to get when you go out there. Other kickers have empathy 
for me, that I have to kick on this field all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, who began the year as the NFL's second-most accurate kicker behind New 
Orleans' Morten Andersen, tied the game with a line-drive, 41-yard field goal 
with 3:48 left in regulation time. 
</P>
<P>
He was wide right on a 45-yarder with four seconds left in regulation, but an 
offside call against Cleveland (7-3-1) gave him a second chance from 39 yards. 
That one was wide left. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery's 47-yard try with three seconds left in overtime was short. 
</P>
<P>
The game lived up to its billing as a grudge match between the Browns and their 
former coach, Marty Schottenheimer, head coach of the Chiefs (4-6-1). 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland put Kansas City quarterback Steve Pelluer out of the game with a 
sprained knee in the first quarter. The Browns held Christian Okoye, the NFL's 
leading rusher, to 40 yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Metcalf scored on a one-yard run to give Cleveland a 10-7 lead in the 
third quarter after Chiefs scored on the second play of the second half when 
Neil Smith ran Mike Oliphant's fumble three yards to score.

BROWNS SHOW DITKA THE FLIP SIDE, 27-7

<P>
Now Mike Ditka knows how the other half lives. 
</P>
<P>
Make that the other 99%. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Ditka's seven years as head coach, the Chicago Bears are 
on a three-game losing streak, courtesy of a 27-7 drubbing administered Monday 
night by the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a day of reckoning -- not a day of atonement, but a day of 
reckoning." Ditka said after Bernie Kosar completed 22 of 29 passes for 281 
yards, including a 97-yard touchdown pass to Webster Slaughter and a three-yard 
toss to Eric Metcalf, who also ran seven yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It's the first such streak for the injury-ravaged Bears, who started four 
rookies on defense, since Nov. 15-26, 1981, the year before Ditka took over and 
turned the team into one of the National Football League's most dominant teams. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, their 4-3 record drops them a game behind Minnesota in the NFC Central 
Division, the first time they've been out of first place in the division since 
the final game of the 1983 season -- 85 games ago. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike last week, when he exploded after a loss to Houston and suggested 
the Bears might not win again, he was more optimistic, praising his defense, 
which has allowed 102 points the past three weeks after surrendering just 61 in 
the opening four wins. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in them and I believe we can turn it around," said Ditka, whose team 
plays the Rams at home next week in a game that could have huge playoff 
ramifications for a team that's made the playoffs the last five years. "I'm 
more encouraged today than I have been the last two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
They also have respect. 
</P>
<P>
"When you beat a team like Chicago on a Monday night, that's something," said 
Michael Dean Perry, who led the defensive effort for the Browns, who broke 
their own two-game losing streak and moved into a three-way tie at 4-3 with

Perry, whose brother, William, plays for the Bears, led a defense that knocked 
Mike Tomczak from the game late in the third quarter after he went four of 14 
for 76 yards. They also stopped the Bears on Cleveland's two-yard line midway 
through the third quarter. One play later, Kosar hit Slaughter on the 97-yard 
scoring pass play that was the longest play from scrimmage in Brown history. 
</P>
<P>
The call was made by offensive coordinator Marc Trestman, who was under fire in 
the past two weeks as the Browns scored just 17 points in two defeats. And it 
redeemed Kosar, who last week had four passes intercepted in a 17-7 loss to 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter had eight catches for 186 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's only touchdown came on a five-yard pass from Jim Harbaugh to Wendell 
Davis with 3:47 left.

REEVES BLASTS TAGLIABUE FOR A 'ROOKIE' MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Dan Reeves of the Denver Broncos criticized a decision by the NFL to 
allow the Cleveland Browns to arrive in Denver later than usual for Sunday's 
AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"They took advantage of a rookie commissioner (Paul Tagliabue)," Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
League rules require visiting teams to arrive at least 48 hours before a 
championship game, but the Browns sought and were granted a waiver from 
Tagliabue allowing them to arrive on Saturday, 24 hours before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland team physicians believe the Browns will be less bothered by Denver's 
mile-high altitude if they arrive only 24 hours before game time. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went to Cleveland three years ago, we had to get in there two days 
early," Reeves said. "Part of the reason was media accessibility, even though 
the only Broncos at a Friday press conference were me and one player. 
</P>
<P>
"Traveling on Friday is definitely disruptive. It's a disadvantage. You 
practice at home before you leave. You have to meet at your hotel on Saturday. 
In Cleveland, our players couldn't sleep at night because their fans kept 
driving around our hotel, honking their horns. "It's disruptive having to go on 
the road, but that's the way it's supposed to be. That's why you play for the 
home-field advantage. I agree that the rule is antiquated. But to all of a 
sudden have it changed the week before the game is a mistake, in my opinion. I 
don't agree with the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves continued to needle the Browns over their apparent preoccupation with 
Denver's thin air. 
</P>
<P>
"The altitude is going to be a factor whether they come in here 45 minutes 
before the game or 45 days before the game," he said. "They went to Albuquerque 
for a whole week one year. Another time they came here the day before. It 
doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of our crowd and the altitude, I think most people around the league 
would agree that we have the biggest home-field advantage of any team. The thin 
air does have an effect. Our record at home proves that." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to muzzle any ideas fans might have about starting up a Denver "dawg 
pound," officials say they plan to clamp down on rowdy people who throw objects 
during Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Fans caught tossing items on the field at Mile High Stadium during the AFC 
championship game will be arrested, and could lose rights to season tickets, 
officials say. In addition, security will be beefed up. 
</P>
<P>
During an Oct. 1 game in Cleveland when the Browns defeated the Broncos, 16-13, 
fans pelted players and officials with dog biscuits, eggs and even radio 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Tom Dooley had the Broncos switch ends of the field during the game to 
avoid the "Dawg Pound," after he was hit on the head with an AA battery. The 
"Dawg Pound" is the nickname given to the east end of the Browns' stadium where 
the rowdiest fans sit. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bud Carson dreams of having his Cleveland Browns run through the Denver 
defense the way the Pittsburgh Steelers did for half a game last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But he says it won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't duplicate Pittsburgh's running game," Carson said. "There are a few 
things that they do that we also do with our running game, but we don't do them 
as well. We're a different team than they are."

Ozzie Newsome, the NFL's all-time reception leader among tight ends, said today 
that he will return for one more season with the Cleveland Browns. Newsome, who 
has been the subject of retirement speculation for several years, said he had 
decided to leave the game after last season but changed his mind after an 
overhaul of the Browns' coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Marty Schottenheimer quit the Browns at the end of the season over 
philosophical differences with owner Art Modell, and most of Schottenheimer's 
assistants also left. Newsome decided to wait until a new head coach, Bud 
Carson, was chosen, and the veteran tight end then had a long talk with Marc 
Trestman, Cleveland's quarterback coach last season, who has been elevated to 
offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
During his career, Newsome has had 610 receptions for 7,416 yards and 44 
touchdowns. He hasn't fumbled in his last 505 receptions and has caught at 
least 30 passes in each of his 11 seasons. Newsome, who celebrates his 33rd 
birthday Thursday, had 35 catches for 343 yards last season and extended his 
consecutive game reception streak to 143 games.

   This is a democracy, where the majority rules, so what say we take a vote about ending the National Football League season now, sans Super Bowl? 

   All in favor of awarding the championship to the Washington Redskins, the National Conference titlists, raise your hands. 
Let's see, Jack Kent Cooke is one, Joe Gibbs is two, and those two dozen folks wearing pig snouts make it 26. 
Anyone else? 
OK. 

   Now everybody for the Denver Broncos. 
Oooh, better not get impatient, because this count is gonna take awhile. 
Two hundred twenty million and one; 220,000,002; 220,000,003 . . . my calculator just gave out. 
No matter, though. 
I think it's safe to say that the Broncs squeaked through. 

   The Denverites are the people's cherce because here on Sunday in the SB semieye, a.k.a. the American Conference final, they helped give us the kind of game we always want from a Super Bowl, but never get. 
They and the Cleveland Browns, who are growing accustomed to being the party of the second part in these gridiron affairs of the palpitating heart, posted 71 points in Mile High Stadium. 
The Broncos got 38 of 'em to win. 

   It wasn't so much how many points were scored as how. 
Denver quarterback John Elway passed, ran and even punted in as good an impersonation of Frank Merriwell as you'll see in these specialized times, and Bernie Kosar, his Cleveland counterpart, almost bested him in his own tall, cool fashion. 

   The Brownies trailed by 18 points as late as the third quarter, but came within a swipe of sending the game into overtime. 
Down 38-31, Kosar moved his team 67 yards to the Denver eight with 1:12 left in a drive reminiscent of the Elway-engineered one that set up the Broncos for an overtime win in this same event last year in Cleveland. 
The Browns' bowling-ball running back, Earnest Byner, then swept left to within a tantalizing stride of the end zone, only to have Bronco reserve cornerback Jeremiah Castille knock the ball from his grasp and fall on it at the three. 
Denver ran out the clock from there, contributing a harmless safety to the Cleveland point cache. 

   Later, in a switcheroo worthy of this out-of-whack season, the goat of that play met the press while the hero took a shower and a powder. 
"I tried to slide between two tacklers, and I felt one of them grab the ball," Byner manfully said later. 
"My first thought was to find it, but I guess somebody beat me to it." 
Castille's version of the heist will have to await Super Bowl Hype Week, because he said he ain't talking until then. 

   His stance reminds us that, anticlimactic or not, we'll have an SB, numero 22, in San Diego on Jan. 31. 
The Broncos will meet the Redskins, whose 17-10 home win over the Minnesota Vikings in Sunday's early game at least gave the nation a chance for a nice nap before the Broncos-Browns thriller. 
And who knows? 
Historical evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, it could even be a good one. 
Possibly. 

   I mean, anything's possible, especially with young Mr. Elway on the scene. 
Here's a guy who looks like he's having fun on the NFL's corporate gridiron, scratching plays in the dirt and improvising when they don't develop as planned. 
No less a throwback is the formation from which he runs many of his plays. 
They call it the "shotgun," but close one eye and you could swear it was the single-wing of Merriwell's day. 

   Elway's helter-skelter talents were displayed best Sunday in the touchdown that should have put away the Browns. 
After Cleveland had scored on its first possession of the second half to cut the Denver lead to 21-10, Elway faced a third-down and 10 from his own 20 yard line. 
He escaped two Browns tacklers, rebounded off one of his own blockers, sprinted to the right and, finally, found Mark Jackson open for a pass on the sideline five yards up field. 
Jackson, one of the Broncos' corps of small, speedy receivers, proceeded to dash 75 yards into the end zone to make it 28-10, Denver. 

   "There was the primary receiver on that play, the secondary receiver, and me," Jackson later noted. 
"But with John scrambling the way he does, there's always a chance you'll get the ball." 

   Cleveland might have packed it in right there, or earlier after an interception and fumble led to first-half Bronco scores, but it didn't. 
Instead, its Bernie-and-Earnie show took over. 
On the Browns' next possession, Kosar hit passes of 12, 30 and 32 yards, the first and third of those to fullback Byner, to pull his team to within 11 points. 
After his mates stopped the Broncos on downs, Kosar connected on three straight passes and handed off to Byner for the final four yards in another touchdown drive. 

   A Denver field goal made it 31-24. 
Kosar passed for 72 of 86 yards in a drive that tied it at 31. 
Denver got the lead back on five Elway passes from the single-wing (oops, shotgun), capped by a 20-yarder to Sammy Winder with four minutes left. 
Then the final, fatal, Cleveland thrust. 

   Byner, a rugged sort who picked up little press ink at college (East Carolina) or in four useful pro seasons, ran for 67 yards and caught seven passes for 120 yards Sunday. 
So great was his contribution that his teammates, to a man, sought to shield him from the onus of his fumble. 
"Without him, we wouldn't have been close," declared Kosar. 
The QB might have said as much for himself. 
He passed for 356 yards on the day, to Elway's 281. 

   In the contest's aftermath, the winners counted their blessings and the losers counted their disappointments. 
"I'm numb," said Denver coach Dan Reeves. 
"The good Lord smiled on us today." 
"I'm frustrated, mad, disappointed," said Browns tackle Cody Risien. 
"After last year's game {a 23-20 Denver win in overtime}, I'm beginning to think Somebody Up There doesn't like us." 

   But Risien was fan enough to acknowledge the drama and quality of the fray, and wish for a rematch. 
One would certainly be fun. 
All in favor of staging it in San Diego in two weeks raise your hands.

Jerry Van Dyke, in his role as dimwitted Luther Van Dam from "Coach," 
apologized on the air for having knocked Cleveland two weeks ago in a 
promotional spot for the ABC comedy, and the mayor accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The apology came in a promo as well. 
</P>
<P>
It was aired during the "Monday Night Football" game between the Cleveland 
Browns and the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to say that I'm sorry, Cleveland, and I love Cleveland and I love 
the people in it," Van Dyke said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Michael R. White replied: "The Cleveland of today and the Cleveland of 15 
years ago are vastly different places. I think the apology frankly recognizes 
that there has been a major improvement." 
</P>
<P>
The joke that got Cleveland so mad was broadcast Oct. 8 during a Monday night 
game between Cleveland and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dyke, a football coach in "Coach," said in the promo, "I think the problem 
with Cleveland is, even if you win, you lose. You still got to go home to 
Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the football season, a "Coach" promo made the same joke about 
Buffalo, incensing residents of that city.

Interim Coach Jim Shofner, who will lead the Browns against the Rams in 
Cleveland Sunday, said he hasn't really concerned himself with whether he will 
be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't even thought otherwise, really," Shofner said. 
</P>
<P>
"You start doing the job, you just assume you're going to do it from now on, 
and that's the way I'm thinking. And how it'll work out, I don't know. But no 
one has said 'This is your job' by any means." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bernie Kosar, who worked closely with Shofner when Shofner was 
former coach Bud Carson's offensive coordinator, made it clear where he stands. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the players are looking for some stability and respect Jim Shofner," 
Kosar said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson said there is no reason to fear the chilly weather in 
Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Supposed to be in the 40s," Robinson said. "I think when it's bad is when it 
gets down to the 20s. Thirties are not bad. Forties aren't bad. I don't think 
we anticipate problems there with the weather." TIM KAWAKAMI

HE GETS GREAT RECEPTION; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: BROWNS RECEIVER WEBSTER SLAUGHTER CAN FAKE AND TALK AND DANCE AND 
EVEN RUN -- ANYTHING TO GET OPEN.

<TEXT>
<P>
His California license plates read "WEB-STAR," and they deliver a significant 
message about Webster Slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after completing an outstanding career at San Diego State, Slaughter 
is the big-play man of the Cleveland Browns -- a player of Pro Bowl stature. He 
will pose big problems for the Chargers when they meet the Browns Sunday in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Lynn, the Charger defensive coordinator, talked about the task of 
containing Webster, a 6-foot, 170-pounder whose 19-yard average per catch last 
season was the best in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a marvelous player," Lynn said. "He makes tough catches, he makes 
acrobatic catches, he makes catches in a crowd. He catches balls he should 
catch and he catches balls he shouldn't catch. 
</P>
<P>
"He isn't a 4.2 guy (for 40 yards) -- only about 4.5 -- yet he's a deep threat, 
for several reasons. He has good timing with the quarterback (Bernie Kosar), he 
sets up the defenders well, and he explodes out of the break. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll talk trash with you, and that's part of his competitive nature. He's 
such a competitive guy that you can't let up on him. We'll probably double-team 
him a lot Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn called Slaughter and teammate Reggie Langhorne "probably the most 
underrated pair of receivers in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Charger cornerback Gill Byrd compared Slaughter to a former teammate, Wes 
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a faster version of Chandler," Byrd said. "Wes had that knack of getting 
open all the time. Slaughter reminds me of him. He always knows where the 
defensive back is going to be, and he has great quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Gary Plummer said that when the Browns use a so-called gadget play, 
it's a good bet that Slaughter will be the key man. 
</P>
<P>
"They go to him for big yardage," Plummer said. "He'll run reverses and 
flea-flickers, and he'll catch halfback passes." 
</P>
<P>
Strong safety Marty Bayless cited another side of Slaughter's competitive 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
"He can be a showboat," Bayless said. "As small as he is, he's not afraid to 
take a lick, and when he gets up, he'll let you know he's around. He'll show 
the ball in your face or pat you on the butt or something like that. He can get 
you teed off. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, though, he's an underrated receiver. He's deceptive. He'll put 
you to sleep, maybe take a play off, but on the next play he'll be in the end 
zone dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, who will be 26 on Oct. 19, has reached the end zone 20 times since 
the Browns made him their second-round draft choice in 1986. He has caught 188 
passes for 3,164 yards, including six for 83 yards this season, after catching 
122 for 1,647 yards in two seasons at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a burner, but I can get by anybody," Slaughter said by telephone from 
Cleveland. "The 4.2 guys usually don't have good hands. I'm fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
Fast enough, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
En route to leading the AFC in average per catch last year, Slaughter had 
receptions of 97, 80 and 77 yards. His 97-yarder against the Chicago Bears was 
a league high, and his 1,236-yard total set a club record. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, who has been hampered this season by what he calls a tender knee, 
appeared close to his old self when he caught five passes against the New York 
Jets last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been basically nicked up since training camp," Slaughter said. "The only 
thing that will help is rest, and there's no time for that." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter's physical problem is one of the reasons for the anemic production of 
the Browns' offense in their first two games, one of which they won. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as important as anybody we have," Coach Bud Carson said. "He made as many 
big plays last year as anybody in the league except maybe San Francisco. We 
need him 100%." 
</P>
<P>
One can grasp the degree of Slaughter's importance by the fact that many 
veteran observers consider him the Browns' best receiver since the days of Hall 
of Famer Paul Warfield, who retired in 1977. In an interesting twist, it was 
Warfield, then scouting, who recommended that the Browns draft Slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
As good as he is on the football field, Slaughter's talents are anything but 
one-dimensional. In fact, he is so adept at playing a saxophone that he didn't 
even try out for football until his senior year at Franklin High School in 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
"I played in the band," he said. "We were No. 1 in the nation in the music 
Olympics in Anaheim. I played alto sax, then I switched to tenor. I was no 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
"Then before my senior year, one of the coaches saw me in a pickup basketball 
game and asked me to come out for football. Even after I made the team, I 
stayed with the band. I just couldn't march at the games. 
</P>
<P>
"I still play the sax whenever I get a chance, but I miss it sometimes. I like 
jazz and top-40 pop." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lack of a football background, Slaughter was named to the 
all-conference team in his only high school season. Then he made such a good 
impression at San Joaquin Delta Junior College in Stockton that he received a 
flock of scholarship offers. 
</P>
<P>
"I narrowed it down to Illinois and San Diego State," he said. "I picked San 
Diego State because it was closer to home and it was warmer. I had great 
coaching there, and I worked with an excellent quarterback in Todd Santos. Todd 
and I had great rapport." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter's musical bent doesn't end with tooting a saxophone, either. He and 
Eric Metcalf, the Browns' game-breaking running back, were featured at halftime 
of NBC's Thanksgiving Day game last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was rapping, and Eric was dancing," Slaughter said. "The reviews were pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the gig was written for 10 Cleveland players, but eight failed to 
show up. Slaughter improvised. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter adapts so easily to situations that a former Cleveland columnist, Bob 
Kravitz, wrote recently, "He represents the very essence of cool. Cool shades. 
Cool duds. Cool car." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter is even cool when he recalls the two times he fell asleep at the 
wheel of his car. 
</P>
<P>
"In my rookie year, we watched a highlight film downtown at night," he said. "I 
left early because I was sleepy. All the way home, I kept nodding off, and 
finally I fell asleep and hit the stone divider on a bridge. The car was 
totaled. 
</P>
<P>
"The following year, when we broke camp, I was going home, and the same thing 
happened. Luckily, I just hit a couple of mail boxes and no damage was done." 
</P>

Obviously, Slaughter does things his way. A year ago, he dreamed up an idea so 
drastic in the NFL's eyes that it led to a new rule. Hereafter, all players on 
a team must wear solid-color shoes and all must be the same color. You might 
call it the Webster Slaughter Rule. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Monday night game in which he was to make his 97-yard reception, 
Slaughter painted his shoes orange and Metcalf did the same. Most of the Brown 
players were wearing shoes that were all or partially orange by the end the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We painted just about everybody's shoes one way or another," Slaughter said. 
"Nobody put a stop to it, so we kept on painting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're wearing white now, but we've been working on a secret plan, so don't be 
surprised if you see orange again."

GARY FUMBLING AWAY STARTING ROLE

Don't look now, but the role as the Rams' primary tailback is beginning to slip 
out of Cleveland Gary's hands as swiftly as those footballs have been the past 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After Gary fumbled one away in Sunday's first quarter -- his third lost fumble 
in three weeks -- Coach John Robinson yanked him in favor of little-used Gaston 
Green, and then after the Rams' 38-23 victory over the Browns, the coach had 
much praise for Green. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson didn't have quite so many kind words for Gary, however, who saw 
limited post-fumble time. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what you call on-the-job training," Robinson said of the Gary hook. "He 
can't fumble the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been negligent, I guess you'd almost say, in (not) playing Gaston. And he 
has earned the right to play on this football team." 
</P>
<P>
Green, who had only 31 carries all season before Sunday, rushed 13 times for 57 
yards and caught one pass for a 16-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I really haven't had the chance too much in my career, so it felt good to get 
in there early and get some carries," Green said. "Coach Robinson decides who 
plays when, and I just wanted to do everything I could in this opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
With Gary's fumbles bothering Robinson, could Green begin to challenge for the 
starting spot? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're both good players," Robinson said. "I don't want it to be one 
of those teeter-totters where one's up, the other's down, but they're both good 
players. Gaston has proven that he can do some things." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Greene said he was just as surprised as everybody else when the referee 
waived off his apparent forced fumble on a sack of Bernie Kosar, Browns 
quarterback. Greene came at Kosar from the blind side, and the ball appeared to 
spring loose on impact. It was recovered by defensive tackle Alvin Wright, but 
the referee ruled Kosar was in Greene's grasp and blew the play dead as a sack. 
</P>
<P>
"In the grasp?" said Greene, who had three sacks Sunday. "I hit him. I hit him. 
OK, I can understand if I was pulling him to the ground and then he fumbled. 
OK. But I thought I put a pretty good shot on him." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams and Browns were involved in some pushing and shoving in the final 
moments of the game when the Rams were deep in Cleveland territory and trying 
to get their newest running back, Marcus Dupree, an NFL touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After Dupree dived into the line, several Browns appeared to take swings at him 
in the pile, and one player seemed to be twisting his leg after the play was 
blown dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I was saying, 'What's going on? What's going on?' " said Dupree, who got 
his first playing time since the Giants' game and gained eight yards in two 
carries. "I had to get up fighting, get a little respect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Carson is gone, fired as the Browns' coach four weeks ago, and in Cleveland 
they're campaigning for a similar fate for owner Art Modell. 
</P>
<P>
Two T-shirts were making the rounds at Cleveland Stadium Sunday. One read: 
Losing Is A Work of Art. The other featured mug shots of the Three Stooges with 
the following inscription: Larry, Curly and Moe-dell. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger messages were reserved for the bedsheet banners hanging all over the 
stadium. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 Art + Modell = 2 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Santa, We Want A New Owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Must Go. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey Art, Stop The Maddness. 
</P>
<P>
Hey Dawgs, check your spelling.

EAGLES USE GIZMO TO BEAT BROWNS IN LONDON

In a game filled with errors common to exhibition openers, Philadelphia 
quarterback Don McPherson and wide receiver Gizmo Williams came up with a 
picture-perfect play that helped the Eagles beat the Cleveland Browns, 17-13, 
in the fourth annual American Bowl played Sunday in front of 73,677 at Wembley 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
An interception by safety Tom Gerhart four plays after McPherson failed to 
scored on a fourth-and-goal play gave the Eagles the ball at their 48 and set 
up a 34-yard McPherson-to-Williams touchdown pass play that gave Philadelphia a 
17-6 lead with 10:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
The loss spoiled the coaching debut of Cleveland's Bud Carson, former Ram 
defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson, a second-year pro from Syracuse, replaced Eagle starter Randall 
Cunningham at the beginning of the second quarter with the Eagles leading, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
After his missed opportunity at the goal line, McPherson made the most of the 
second chance that Gerhart's interception gave him. McPherson passed nine yards 
to Robert Drummond for a first down. Then after Cleveland was called for 
holding, negating a sack, McPherson looped the ball into the right corner of 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who signed with the Eagles in the off-season from the Canadian 
Football League, dove for the ball and made a fingertip catch, ending the play 
with a forward roll. He tossed the ball to an official, then did a forward flip 
in the air -- a move that cost the Eagles five yards on the ensuing kickoff for 
showboating. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to learn to play NFL football. He can get away with that in Canada," 
Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan said. "The jury is still out on Gizmo Williams."

RAIDERS WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR ADOLPH; 
</P>
<P>
NEW DEFENSIVE COACH WILL FIND THINGS DIFFERENT FROM CLEVELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Dave Adolph's dog days are over. 
</P>
<P>
Or are they? 
</P>
<P>
Adolph, defensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns the last 3 seasons, was 
hired by the Raiders Friday to perform the same function. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the 51-year-old Adolph will coach the linebackers along with Sam 
Gruneisen and "organize the defense." The Raiders don't use the term defensive 
coordinator, but Adolph will be calling the defensive signals. 
</P>
<P>
He thus jumps from a team with the third-best defense in the league and those 
wild fans in the Dog Pound to one of the worst defenses in Raider history and 
those wild rumors of a team split by a power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders finished the 1988 season at 7-9 with their defense in a shambles. 
The team surrendered 369 points, its highest total since 1962 in the old 
free-wheeling days of the American Football League. With a shot at the playoffs 
remaining on the final Sunday of the season, the Raiders gave up 43 points and 
490 yards in total offense in losing to the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
And then the real blood bath began. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive coordinator Charlie Sumner: Fired. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive backfield coach Willie Brown, an Al Davis favorite: Fired. 
</P>
<P>
Receiver coach Nick Nicolau, a Mike Shanahan guy: Fired. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive line coach Earl Leggett: Resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive backfield coach Jimmy Warren: Reportedly cleaned out his desk, went 
home to Louisiana and was said to have been fired by one of the news services, 
but remains employed according to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Warren's status is relatively stable, however, compared to the off-again, 
on-again position of assistants Tom Walsh and Joe Scannella, pawns in an 
apparent struggle between Davis, the managing general partner, and Shanahan, 
the head coach. Shanahan reportedly fired Walsh and Scannella at season's end 
only to have Davis turn around and reinstate them. 
</P>
<P>
Into this steps Adolph who brings with him 27 years of coaching experience. 
Some skill as a mediator probably wouldn't hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
Adolph was a defensive assistant in his first tour of duty with Cleveland, 
1979-84, went to the San Diego Chargers for a year, then returned to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
A guard-linebacker at the University of Akron, in his hometown, Adolph began 
his coaching career in Cleveland at the high school level in 1962. After a 
year, he moved into the collegiate ranks, spending time at Akron, Connecticut, 
Kentucky, Illinois and at Ohio State under Woody Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
"The addition of Dave Adolph to our staff couldn't please me more," Shanahan 
said. "Dave is an extremely knowledgeable coach who has the reputation of being 
an excellent teacher as well as a motivator."

RAIDERS GAIN ON DEFENSE, LOSE ON OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Raiders found one of the missing pieces in the puzzle of their defense . . 
. but lost one from their offense Friday, as the signing period for 
unrestricted free agents moved into its final hours. 
</P>
<P>
From the Cleveland Browns, they signed Bob Golic, the 31-year-old, three-time 
Pro Bowl nose tackle they've been looking for since the departure of Reggie 
Kinlaw in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
To the San Diego Chargers, they lost tight end Andy Parker, the starter last 
season after Todd Christensen was hurt. The little-known Parker is a better 
blocker and was expected to retain the starting job this season even with 
Christensen back. 
</P>
<P>
Golic's agent, Ralph Cindrich, confirmed that his client had been "signed, 
sealed and delivered," and after a day of inquiries, the Raiders announced it, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
The team made no mention of Parker, but he signed a Charger contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Golic story is a big one in Cleveland, where he was born and became a local 
star and community leader. An All-American linebacker at Notre Dame, he was a 
No. 2 pick of the New England Patriots in 1979 but was waived in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
He was then picked up by the Browns, who converted him to nose tackle. 
Free-spirited and fun-loving, he gave new style to the position he picked up so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "A nose tackle is like a fire hydrant." 
</P>
<P>
And: "I'm 6-3 on Saturday nights, but 6-0 on Sunday nights." 
</P>
<P>
Golic is best known as a run defender, which will come in handy for the 
Raiders, whose rushing defense fell apart last season. 
</P>
<P>
Since waiving Kinlaw, a star of the '84 Super Bowl, they had tried the 6-5 Bill 
Pickel, a natural defensive tackle, at the nose, with progressively worse 
results. Last season, the Raiders largely abandoned their old base defense for 
a four-man line -- at the order of Al Davis, who wanted more pressure. 
Meanwhile, other players petitioned the coaches to bring back the 3-4, since it 
was the only run defense they knew how to play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "With two great pass rushers, they need someone with a big butt in 
the middle to tie up the guard and the center and stop the run." 
</P>
<P>
The signing was precipitated by changes on the Raiders and the Browns. The new 
Raider defensive coordinator, Dave Adolph, comes from Cleveland. The new Brown 
head coach, Bud Carson, the former New York Jets' defensive coordinator, plans 
to put in a four-man line. 
</P>
<P>
Golic signed a two-year contract, which will pay him $600,000 and $650,000, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
His welcome to the Raiders seems well on its way. While visiting the Raider 
facility, he stayed at the home of Howie Long. 
</P>
<P>
Parker signed a two-year contract which, with makeable incentives, reportedly 
will pay him $400,000 a year, a big increase over the $175,000 he made last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, under new Coach Dan Henning, the former Washington Redskins 
assistant, are expected to go to a double tight-end alignment, and Parker is 
expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
A No. 5 pick from Utah in 1984, the 6-foot-5, 245-pounder played on special 
teams until Christensen was hurt last season. Coach Mike Shanahan's preference 
for the better blocker led him to Parker, rather than the smaller, faster Trey 
Junkin, a better pass receiver. Christensen's listed weight is only 230, and, 
despite his years of pass receiving prowess, Shanahan was thought to be leaning 
toward keeping Parker No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The signing period ends today. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have added Golic; linebackers Otis Wilson from the Chicago Bears, 
Jackie Shipp from the Miami Dolphins and Emanuel King from the Cincinnati 
Bengals; offensive lineman Dale Hellestrae of the Buffalo Bills, and 
placekicker Jeff Jaeger of the Browns. They were talking with Chicago 
cornerback Mike Richardson, who is in the Bears' doghouse, but haven't made a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have lost Parker; linebacker Reggie McKenzie to the Phoenix 
Cardinals; kick returner Chris Woods to the Browns; running backs Chris 
McLemore to the Seattle Seahawks and Reggie Ware to the Denver Broncos. Only 
Parker and McKenzie were on the active roster throughout last season, and only 
Parker figured prominently in Raider plans.

<LEADPARA>  National Football League legend Paul Brown, who founded the Cleveland Browns
and Cincinnati Bengals and built them into pro football powerhouses, died this
morning. He was 82.;    Bengals spokesman Allan Heim said Brown died at his
home in Cincinnati from complications caused by pneumonia.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NFL LEGEND PAUL BROWN DIES AT 82  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "He's certainly one of the key figures in professional sports," former
Bengals quarterback Ken Anderson said. "Football would not be what it is
without him. He was always concerned about his guys after football. Football
was just a steppingstone. He wanted you to prepare for your life's work.";   
Brown began his coaching career in 1930 after graduating from Miami (Ohio)
University, where he was a star quarterback.;    After coaching at a high
school in Massillon, Ohio, and at Ohio State, Brown formed the Browns of the
All America Conference in 1946 and coached the team. The Browns captured all
four titles in the league's existence before entering the NFL in 1950. They
won championship that year -- the first of their three titles in the 1950s.;  
 The 1960s saw Brown get fired in Cleveland, win election to the Pro Football
Hall of Fame and form the Bengals expansion franchise that he coached until
1975. He continued to run the Bengals' operations as vice president and
general manager.;    "I couldn't go back (into football after Cleveland)
unless I was in complete charge," he said. "I had it both ways -- when the
Browns started -- and for a long time after -- I was in complete charge. . . .
And that's the way it must be. . . . The history of all successful teams shows
how authority concentrated in the coach.";    Former Bengals offensive lineman
Dave Lapham praised Brown's organizational skills.;    "I think that the real
key to the success of Paul Brown was his organizational ability," Lapham said.
"He basically structured his football team as a CEO would his company.";    It
was as a coach that Brown made his biggest mark on the game. He was known for
his innovations -- introducing classroom techniques that are commonplace
today, using film to grade players, calling plays from the sideline.;    He
ran his team with a seriousness that shaped his image.;    "I was a
serious-looking guy," he said. "Of course, you can't exactly do much about how
you look. They formed images of me.;    "Every time we'd go to New York to
play the Giants -- and were beating them pretty regularly -- I'd get a new
term. The first one was 'the cold, calculating Brown.' Then I got to be
'deadly'; we were winning too much," he said, laughing. "Cold, deadly,
calculating.";    And a winner. Brown had a 213-104-9 record as a
professional.;    He is survived by his wife, Mary, and two sons, Mike and
Pete. Mike is the Bengals' assistant general manager, and Pete is director of
player personnel. His first wife, Katy, died in 1969. Another son, Robin, died
in 1978.;    Heim said a funeral is scheduled Wednesday morning at St.
Timothy's Episcopal Church in Massillon.  </TEXT>

CHARGERS SIGN RAIDERS' PARKER, RAMS' COLLINS

<P>
The Chargers announced Friday the acquisition of two more unrestricted free 
agents, both from Southern California neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The signings of former Raider tight end Andy Parker, a San Dieguito High 
graduate, and former Ram linebacker Jim Collins gave the Chargers seven under 
the National Football League's new free agent policy. The deadline for such 
signings is 9 o'clock tonight. 
</P>
<P>
While losing Parker, the Raiders signed 31-year-old Bob Golic, a three-time Pro 
Bowl nose tackle for the Cleveland Browns. The Rams also lost former Charger 
tight end Eric Sievers, to New England. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 6-feet-5, 245 pounds, signed a two-year Charger contract that, with 
attainable incentives, reportedly will pay him $400,000 a year, a big increase 
over the $175,000 he made last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, under new Coach Dan Henning, are expected to go to a double 
tight-end alignment, and Parker is expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
A No. 5 pick from Utah in 1984, Parker played on special teams until Todd 
Christensen was hurt last season. Parker, 15 pounds heavier and a better 
blocker than Christensen, was expected to retain his starting job despite 
Christensen's years of pass-receiving prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 27, has just six catches in his NFL career, including four for 33 yards 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
He attended San Dieguito after two years at Dana Hills High in Dana Point. At 
San Dieguito, he was first-team All-Palomar League and the team's most valuable 
player in football and also participated in basketball, baseball and track. He 
was Utah's leading receiver as a senior with 33 catches for 395 yards in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, 30, appeared in just four games for the Rams last season after 
spending the first 12 weeks on injured reserve with a knee injury. Once perhaps 
the team's top defensive player, Collins has been slowed in recent years by 
serious injuries. He missed all of 1986 with a neck injury and underwent 
arthroscopic surgery last summer to repair a chronically damaged right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, 6-2, 233 pounds, has no cartilage in the knee, but played well after 
returning to the lineup late last season. His best season was 1985, when he led 
the Rams in tackles with 140 and was named to the Pro Bowl. He has started 67 
of 80 career games. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams claimed Sievers on waivers from the Chargers last December and had 
plans for him as a blocking tight end this season. Sievers appeared on special 
teams in the Rams' season-ending win over San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Golic story is a big one in Cleveland, where he was born and became a local 
star and community leader. An All-America linebacker at Notre Dame, he was a 
No. 2 pick of the New England Patriots in 1979 but was waived in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
He was then picked up by the Browns, who converted him to nose tackle. 
Free-spirited and fun-loving, he gave new style to the position he picked up so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "A nose tackle is like a fire hydrant." 
</P>
<P>
And: "I'm 6-3 on Saturday nights, but 6-0 on Sunday nights." 
</P>
<P>
Golic is best known as a run defender, which will come in handy for the 
Raiders, whose rushing defense fell apart last season. Since waiving Reggie 
Kinlaw, a hero of the '84 Super Bowl, they had tried the 6-5 Bill Pickel, a 
natural defensive tackle, at the nose, with progressively worse results. Last 
season, the Raiders largely abandoned their old base defense for a four-man 
line -- at the order of Al Davis who wanted more pressure. Meanwhile, other 
players petitioned the coaches to bring back the 3-4, since it was the only run 
defense they knew how to play. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "With two great pass rushers, they need someone with a big butt in 
the middle to tie up the guard and the center and stop the run." 
</P>
<P>
The signing was precipitated by changes on the Raiders and the Browns. The new 
Raider defensive coordinator, Dave Adolph, comes from Cleveland. The new 
Browns' head coach, Bud Carson, the old Jets' defensive coordinator, plans to 
put in a four-man line. 
</P>
<P>
Golic signed a two-year contract, which will pay him $600,000 and $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
His welcome to the Raiders seems well on its way. While visiting the Raider 
facility, he stayed at the home of Howie Long.

The San Diego Chargers earned their first victory of the season, beating the 
Cleveland Browns, 24-14, Sunday, and Coach Dan Henning gave credit to Dennis 
Conner, of all people. 
</P>
<P>
Henning used the yachtman's 1978 book, "No Excuse to Lose," for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Dennis Conner should take a bow for this win," Henning said. "I met 
him on a flight back from New York in July and asked him to send me his book. 
We got to talking about some of the things he goes through to put a crew and 
challenge together, and I thought they were very poignant in relation to our 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"The media and fans give you all kinds of reasons and excuses, like you're too 
young, you haven't been together long enough, your quarterback is not 
experienced enough. All those things are true, but it's probably true for 20 
other teams, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked with the team about it," Henning said. "I told them I wasn't going to 
give them any excuses, and they shouldn't give themselves any. And I got that 
commitment from them." 
</P>
<P>
He also got: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Touchdown passes of 19 and 23 yards from Billy Joe Tolliver to Anthony 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A game-turning 67-yard interception return from linebacker Henry Rolling to 
set up a one-yard scoring run by Rod Bernstine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A doggone good pass rush on the Dawg Pound's kennel master, 
quarterbackBernie Kosar, who threw three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 42-yard job-saving field goal to open the game's scoring from Fuad 
Reveiz. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kickoff coverage that buried the Browns' Eric Metcalf, who was averaging 34 
yards a return, to 12.8 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Individual outstanding performances from Marion Butts, Craig McEwen and 
Ronnie Harmon on offense, and Lee Williams, Martin Bayless and Sam Seale on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"No excuses, that's what Coach Henning stressed to us the night before the 
game, and then again in the morning," cornerback Gill Byrd said. "He said it 
was just time to win." 
</P>
<P>
Down 14-10 at halftime, the Chargers posted their first second-half points of 
the season against a defense that had not allowed a score in either the third 
or fourth quarters this season. 
</P>
<P>
And they did it by sticking with an erratic Tolliver at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been asked, when Billy's struggling, do you change the quarterback?" 
Henning said. "Well, Billy wasn't the only one struggling out there. We had 
some young people make some errors in movement, and we had some young people 
make some errors in routes, and even a veteran quarterback is going to look 
shaky under those conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver finished 12 of 29 for 139 yards with a pair of interceptions. At 
halftime he was eight of 22 for 86 yards with those two interceptions, and no, 
Henning said, he never gave a thought to warming up Mark Vlasic. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver's first two passes Sunday were incomplete and his third was 
intercepted by linebacker Mike Johnson and returned 64 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But things got better, particularly in the second half after Tolliver's 23-yard 
strike to Miller put the Chargers ahead to stay.

<TEXT>
   Jerry Van Dyke, in his role as dimwitted Luther
Van Dam from ``Coach,'' apologized on the air for having knocked
Cleveland two weeks ago in an promotional spot for the ABC comedy,
and the mayor accepted.
   The apology came in a promo as well. It was aired during the
Monday night football game between the Cleveland Browns and the
Cincinnati Bengals.
   ``I just want to say that I'm sorry, Cleveland, and I love
Cleveland and I love the people in it,'' Van Dam said.
   Mayor Michael R. White replied: ``The Cleveland of today and the
Cleveland of 15 years ago are vastly different places. I think the
apology frankly recognizes that there has been a major
improvement.''
   The joke that got Cleveland so mad was broadcast Oct. 8 during a
Monday night football game between Cleveland and Denver.
   Van Dam, a football coach in ``Coach,'' said in the promo, ``I
think the problem with Cleveland is, even if you win, you lose. You
still got to go home to Cleveland.''
   Dale R. Finley, president of the Cleveland Convention and
Visitors Bureau, said the joke reflected an image created when the
city's oil-slicked Cuyahoga River caught fire 20 years ago and the
city went into default in 1978.
   The city has since changed, he said.

WALSH REPORTEDLY QUITS AS COACH OF 49ERS

Bill Walsh will give up the head coaching job of the Super Bowl champion San 
Francisco 49ers, published reports today said, and there were strong 
indications that he will be replaced by defensive coordinator George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who reportedly will take another job in the organization, has supported 
Seifert as his replacement and Seifert reportedly cut short a trip to Cleveland 
to discuss the Browns coaching job and returned to San Francisco on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A source told The Associated Press today that Cleveland was now leaning toward 
hiring New York Jets defensive coordinator Bud Carson. Browns owner Art Modell 
said he would meet with Carson tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the New York Daily News reported today that sources close to the 
situation said San Francisco owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. wanted a high-profile 
coach like Jimmy Johnson of the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, DeBartolo and their attorneys met Wednesday for two hours in the villa 
DeBartolo is occupying this week while playing in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf 
tournament, the San Francisco Examiner said today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment 
</P>
<P>
Neither Walsh, DeBartolo nor Johnson, reportedly out of his office Wednesday on 
a recruiting trip, was available for comment. DeBartolo had said Tuesday that 
it may be three weeks before a final determination is made on Walsh's status. 
</P>
<P>
However, Miami Sports Information Director Rich Dalrymple, who said he spoke 
with Johnson today, quoted the coach as saying: "It's just a rumor. I have had 
no contact with the San Francisco 49ers." 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Mercury News, citing a source close to the 49ers, reported today 
that Walsh has told his assistants that he will not return for an 11th season, 
but will remain with the team in the front office. 
</P>
<P>
The Examiner quoted 49ers Vice President and General Counsel Carmen Policy as 
saying a meeting of team officials would be held today -- after DeBartolo 
finishes his golf commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Walsh definitely is leaving as coach and whether Seifert would be 
elevated to replace him, Policy on Wednesday night responded: "I can't say, but 
all parties are on the same page." 
</P>
<P>
Seifert, a leading candidate for the Cleveland Browns' vacant head coach 
position, was en route to Cleveland on Wednesday and booked a room in a hotel 
there. But after arriving in Dallas to change planes, he canceled the second 
leg of his trip and booked a return flight to San Francisco.

RAMS: L.A. BEATS CLEVELAND, 38-23, BUT TEAM KNOWS BETTER THAN TO GET OVERLY 
EXCITED ABOUT SUCCESS.

<P>
Revived, relieved and reluctant to jinx their little run of success by 
recklessly predicting even greater things, the Rams Sunday settled into their 
first winning streak of the season calmly and without the normal chortles of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Having lived through their abysmal 3-7 start, they knew better. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody who has watched this team stagger into December knows better than to 
start plotting rosy playoff scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
Are they back? Are they the poltergeist of this weird NFL season, coming back 
to haunt the NFC contenders? Or is playing the curiously atrocious Cleveland 
Browns (2-10) merely a temporary cure for all ills? 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, after methodically dismantling the Browns, 38-23, all the 
Rams knew was that a 5-7 record is better than 4-8; and that a loss in a city 
that knows about wasted seasons would have been tantamount to throwing in the 
towel for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
They knew because Coach John Robinson, in the days leading up to this game -- 
and after the Rams' adrenaline-high victory over the San Francisco 49ers last 
Sunday -- told them so. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't beat the Browns.... 
</P>
<P>
 "What I was trying to say was that we've screwed this thing up pretty good 
before last Sunday," Robinson said. "This, now, is kind of a last chance to get 
back to being the kind of year that we want to feel proud of ourselves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If it's just going to be from the San Francisco game to the end of the year, 
that's what we're trying to do. If we reverted back to being the other kind of 
football team today, then that would've been really tough for us in terms of 
just our self-respect." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' self-respect was safe almost from the outset on Sunday, but it 
appeared that the Browns' might be a lost cause. The Ram offense, after 
tailback Cleveland Gary's third fumble in as many games, jumped out early and 
hard, and the Browns' defense did not have the talent, scheme or heart to 
respond. The Browns have lost seven in a row and show signs that seven might 
turn into 11. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett, who had thrown only one touchdown pass in his last 
five games and who declared his team out of the playoff hunt three weeks ago, 
threw four against the Browns -- who, oddly, found no reason to cover the Ram 
running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who was 22 for 29 for 261 yards, retired his crystal ball and threw 
his team's fate into the chill Ohio wind. It was a day for that. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before that I thought we were out of the playoff picture," Everett 
said. "But if something happens and we're in it, great. If not, we know that it 
was what we did early in the season that kept us out of it." 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams do poke their heads back into playoff contention, it was clear 
Sunday that the offense will have to take them there. 
</P>
<P>
They stirred memories -- particularly of those Everett-led shoot-'em-ups of a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are starting to roll for us," said tailback Gaston Green, who got the 
bulk of action after Gary's fumble and used the opportunity to run for 57 yards 
on 13 carries, catch a 16-yard touchdown pass and generally impress anyone who 
has seen him stand on the Ram sideline his whole career. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Rams gained 411 yards, made seven of 11 third-down tries, held the 
ball for 36:38 and gained an average of 6.5 yards each offensive play. They ran 
for 150 yards to set up the pass. They passed to score. And their defense had 
to hold on. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of offense we think we are," Robinson said, "or thought we 
were going into this season. We have been sporadic offensively, and after that 
first fumble, we executed things pretty darn well today. That's kind of what we 
anticipated our team being. We're pretty hard to stop when we get that kind of 
a thing going." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland started the day in proper fashion when punt returner Brian Brennan 
muffed Keith English's short punt right into the hands of Ram safety Pat 
Terrell. But Gary fumbled right after that, and thoughts of a true football 
Titanic were in order. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams capitalized on a big Darryl Henley punt return with a 30-yard Mike 
Lansford field goal and a 3-0 lead. Cleveland tied it on the next possession, 
but then the Rams revved up the engine. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Pete Holohan scored the first touchdown on a fourth-and-goal 
touchdown pass from Everett inches from the goal line to culminate a 12-play, 
65-yard drive. It was Everett's first touchdown pass in four games, and after a 
tough goal-line stand, the play seemed to deflate an already rattled Brown 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Green capped the second drive with an easy 16-yard scoring reception when 
nobody covered him in the right flat. Ram running backs, who caught eight 
passes and scored on three of them, seemed to be open every time Everett wanted 
them to be. The Browns' linebackers blitzed a lot to try to stir up the 
intensity, but that simply made it easier for the backs to get open. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to be thankful we have a chance to go play again," Brown Interim 
Coach Jim Shofner said. "We have a chance to play somebody and play better than 
we played. That's the only way you can look at it." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' defense began to find out why Cleveland offense has struggled all 
season long. Linebacker Kevin Greene, who had three sacks, stormed in on Brown 
quarterback Bernie Kosar on consecutive plays in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had about four or five three-sack days," Greene said. "When I feel right, 
they start to come." 
</P>
<P>
On the first one, he hit Kosar clean from the blind side, popping the ball 
loose. It wasn't ruled a fumble, but it set the tone. 
</P>
<P>
On the Rams' first possession of the second half, they nearly put the game away 
with an eight-play, 67-yard touchdown drive straight through the Browns' 
defense. Everett was four for five, and at one point hit on three consecutive 
passes for 15, 18 and 15 yards. The last two were to receiver Henry Ellard, 
pushing him past Hall of Famer Tom Fears and making him the Rams' all-time 
receptor with 401 career catches. Ellard finished with six catches and 402 in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
As the crowd of 61,981 murmured its obvious disapproval with the 24-3 score, 
the Browns showed a little life by scoring a touchdown on their next drive. But 
the resurgence was temporary. 
</P>
<P>
Everett found Robert Delpino drifting free down the left side of the field for 
a 21-yard touchdown and a 31-10 Ram lead a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the "Jump Art/2-14" balloon floated around the stadium in front of 
much-loathed Brown owner Art Modell's box, and the message got the most rousing 
response of the windy day. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-play, 70-yard drive, resulting in a three-yard dump pass from Kosar to 
fullback Kevin Mack, cut the lead. But The Rams came back with one last 
touchdown, Everett throwing his fourth of the day, 10 yards to McGee. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will play the Saints Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think New Orleans is a very good team, had a start something like ours and 
now is rolling along pretty good," Robinson said. "I think that's going to be a 
big game." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams deactivated tight end Damone Johnson and receiver Aaron Cox, both of 
whom have hamstring injuries. Pat Carter started in Johnson's place and running 
back Robert Delpino often was used as the team's third wideout. . . . Ram 
injuries listed: cornerback Bobby Humphery (lower back) and safety Michael 
Stewart (concussion).

Don't expect Ram quarterback Jim Everett to emulate Cleveland quarterback 
Bernie Kosar, who went into a tirade Sunday after the Browns' sixth consecutive 
loss. Kosar criticized his teammates for lack of concentration, and this week 
said the Browns appear to have benefited from the lashing as they head into 
this Sunday's game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it was out of frustration; I'm sure it's one way he wants to try to 
motivate his troops," Everett said. "They've had a coaching change, and the 
leadership probably is not there, so he's probably trying to take it upon 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fortunate that we have some team leaders that are very solid individuals 
here, who through thick and thin make the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson, while straining to make it clear he wasn't specifically 
talking about Kosar's action, said he would never want an individual player 
taking his teammates to task in the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you feel betrayed when somebody does something like that, when in 
essence it's behind your back, it's to the press," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also held an on-field meeting to make sure the Rams don't have a 
letdown Sunday against the Cleveland Browns (2-9) after upsetting the San 
Francisco 49ers. TIM KAWAKAMI

<LEADPARA>  It's the question the Houston Oilers have been eager to answer since Coach

<TEXT>     "We reacted pretty well to that today.";   Moon drove the Oilers 82 yards
through a Cleveland snowstorm to the winning touchdown with two minutes left
as Houston beat the Cleveland Browns 17-14. The loss mathematically eliminated
Cleveland (6-9) from playoff possibilities. Houston (11-4) matched a team
record for wins and kept alive its hope for a first-round bye.;   Moon
completed six passes on the winning drive and in the process set a
single-season NFL record for completions. His 2-yard touchdown pass to Haywood
Jeffires with 2 minutes, 19 seconds to play gave the Oilers their first and
only lead. It was Moon's 382nd completion this season, surpassing the mark of
378 set by Dan Marino in 1986.;   The run-and-shoot is a proven offense
indoors, but doubters say it can't be relied upon when snow, wind and cold are
added to the mix.;   Though Houston had trouble getting into the end zone, it
moved the ball well despite 29-degree cold and occasionally heavy snow --
particularly when it mattered most. Moon completed 26 of 40 passes for 250
yards and overcame an interception that killed a fourth-quarter drive.;  
"It's just a matter of making the big plays when you have to, regardless of
the weather," Moon said. "Coach Pardee said we had to go into this game not
making an issue of the weather. We've made some big drives before, although
this was maybe under worse conditions.";   The conditions became the Oilers'
ally at the end. After Bernie Kosar took the Browns to the Houston 1-yard line
with four seconds left, Matt Stover hooked a 19-yard field-goal attempt wide
of the left upright.;   "I think I may have slipped a little bit, but it
wasn't enough to make me miss a field goal," Stover said. "I felt it was,
like, solid. There are no excuses."; VIKINGS 20, RAMS 14: Reggie Rutland's
97-yard interception return led Minnesota (8-7) to a victory over Los Angeles
in Minneapolis, but the Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention
because of victories by Atlanta and Dallas.;   Rutland's franchise-record
interception return added to the Vikings' 13-7 lead. The Rams had driven to
Minnesota's 9-yard line when Rutland stepped in front of receiver Henry Ellard
at the 3, picked off the pass and was escorted along the sideline, past the
Rams' bench, by Audray McMillian for the touchdown.;   "The receiver tried to
lure me inside, then broke outside," Rutland said. "(Rams quarterback Jim
Everett) pretty much threw it on rhythm, without looking. . . . I anticipated
the route and got inside him. I was between the passer and receiver, and no
matter where he threw it, I would have had it.";   The Rams' loss was their
ninth straight, the most for the franchise in Los Angeles. The 1937-38
Cleveland Rams lost 12 in a row.;   "We're going through a hard time," said
Everett, who had four interceptions and a fumble. "It's Week 15, and we're
still making Week 5 mistakes."; PATRIOTS 6, JETS 3: New England used two field
goals by Charlie Baumann to beat New York in East Rutherford, N.J., nearly
ending the Jets' playoff hopes. But San Diego's victory over Miami kept the
Jets, who have lost three straight, still in the AFC wild-card hunt.;   The
Jets (7-8), losing their third game in a row, missed two short field goals,
and quarterback Ken O'Brien's passes often sailed in gusts of up to 30 mph.;  
"I don't know if the pressure got to us or what," New York's Brad Baxter said.
"We had the ball and we had the opportunities. Somebody has to make a big
play.";   Nobody did for the Jets. And New England, 1-15 last year, moved to
6-9 in its first season under Coach Dick MacPherson.; REDSKINS 34, GIANTS 17:
Mark Rypien passed for three touchdowns and NFC East champion Washington
pushed its record to 14-1 with a wipeout of the defending Super Bowl champions
in Washington.;   Gary Clark's 65-yard TD catch started the rout for the
Redskins, who opened a 24-10 halftime lead.;   Fears that the Redskins might
be complacent seemed unfounded. "I was really proud of our guys, because they
had a good attitude," Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs said. "They have a tremendous
amount of respect for the Giants, and they played them hard.";   The victory
marked the first time since 1983 that the Redskins had swept their season
series against New York (7-8).;   Rypien completed 9 of 19 passes for 230
yards and three touchdowns before leaving the game in the fourth period with a
torn fingernail on his passing hand.; BILLS 35, COLTS 7: Kenneth Davis,
playing for the injured Thurman Thomas, rushed for 90 yards and one touchdown
and caught one of three touchdown passes by Jim Kelly as Buffalo (13-2) won in
Indianapolis and clinched the home-field advantage throughout the AFC
playoffs.;   Buffalo scored on its first three possessions and set club season
records for points (444), passing yardage (3,747) and total offense (6,168
yards).;   The only consolation for Indianapolis (1-14), which matched a
franchise record for the most losses in one season, was the guarantee of the
No. 1 pick in next spring's college draft as the worst team in the NFL.;   The
only touchdown for the Colts was on a 1-yard run by Tim Manoa early in the
fourth quarter. Manoa started in place of Eric Dickerson, out with the flu,
and set up his first TD of the season with a 44-yard run, the Colts' longest
rush in two years.;   Thomas, who went in as the NFL's leading rusher this
season, sprained his left ankle on his sixth carry of the game's first
series.; STEELERS 17, BENGALS 10: Bubby Brister threw touchdown passes to
rookie tight ends Adrian Cooper and Keith Cash as host Pittsburgh (6-9)
withstood five turnovers to beat Cincinnati.;   The loss assured the Bengals
(2-13) of the worst season in the franchise's 24-year history.;   The 17
points allowed were the fewest by an NFL-worst Bengals defense that has
allowed 30 or more points nine times. The Steelers, who earlier won in
Cincinnati 33-27 in overtime, swept the Bengals in the season series for the
first time since 1987.  </TEXT>

NEW PLACES 
</P>
<P>
Some familiar faces who made their debuts in new surroundings Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charger quarterback Jim McMahon, acquired from the Chicago Bears on Aug. 18, 
had a 35-3 record as a starter in regular-season games since 1984. But he 
completed only 7 of 18 passes for 91 yards without an interception against the 
Raiders and was replaced by David Archer midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning's debut as Charger coach was equally inauspicius. The Raiders 
scored first and trampled the San Diego defense for 418 yards in total offense 
in a 40-14 win. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Johnson downplayed the significance of his regular-season debut after 
Dallas' 28-0 loss. "I didn't think of it as a first game," said Johnson, who 
replaced the fired Tom Landry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
George Seifert guided the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers to 
a 30-24 victory over Indianapolis, then confessed: "There's a lot more pressure 
on that sideline than I realized." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bud Carson fielded a revamped Cleveland defense that forced eight turnovers and 
produced the most one-sided game in the history of the Browns' rivalry with 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denver converted four Kansas City turnovers into 24 points to continue overcome 
the Chiefs and new Coach Marty Schotenheimer, the former Cleveland coach who is 
now 0-5 against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kelly scored on a two-yard run with no time remaining to lift Buffalo to a 
27-24 victory at Miami. It was Kelly's first NFL rushing touchdown. Kelly set 
up the score by completing five of six passes on the game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Al Del Greco converted a 33-yard field goal with 13 seconds remaining to list 
Phoenix to a 16-13 victory over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reggie Dupard scored on a four-yard run with 1:55 remaining as New England held 
on to defeat the Ney York Jets, 27-24, after blowing a 21-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mike Tomczak threw a 20-yard scoring pass to James Thornton in the fourth 
quarter to lift Chicago past Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Derrick Shepard scored on a 56-yuard point return to highlight New Orleans' 
shutout victory over Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo won its fifth consectuive game against Miami. . . . The Dolphins have 
lost 10 consecutive games to AFC East Division teams. . . . The Bills snapped 
Miami's 13-game winning streak in home openers, longest in the NFL. . . . New 
Orleans posted its first shutout in an opener with a 28-0 win over Dallas. . . 
. The Cowboys were shut out for the first time in the regular season since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Seattle receiver Steve Largent sustained a small fracture of his right elbow 
and did not return after intermission in the Seahawks' 31-7 loss to 
Philadelphia. Before leaving, Largent caught his 98th career touchdown, one shy 
of the NFL record held by Green Bay's Don Hutson. Seattle Coach Chuck Knox said 
Largent would be sidelined for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder separated his left 6ollarbone on the Raiders' 
first possession and was replaced by Steve Beuerlein. Later, the Raiders said 
Schroeder could have returned to the game if needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Houston guard Mike Munchak played only the first half because of an Achilles 
tendon injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes on rookie Barry Sanders: "This young man will 
restore the roar. He's everything we thought he was. . . . Hopefully, he'll 
make me a great coach." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly: "I don't think anyone in this (interview) room 
could have said the Buffalo Bills were going to come back in the last few 
minutes. The only person who knew that was me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh offensive guard Tom Ricketts after the Steelers' 51-0 loss to 
Cleveland: "I've never been in a mess like this in my life."

<DATELINE> San Francisco  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to rumor, there will be a Super Bowl in late January, and it probably will not involve players who have lately been employed as bartenders or repo men. 
However, some difficulty is being experienced in finding teams willing to participate in the thing. 

   Thanksgiving has scarcely been digested, but already the New York Giants, last season's version of the Greatest Team Ever, are dead, no doubt the victims of collective writer's cramp from their postchampionship biography blitz. 
The Chicago Bears, the GTE of 1985-86, are winning, but are finding that a good offense isn't necessarily the best defense. 

   The National Football League's old lions -- the Steelers, Dolphins, Cowboys and Raiders -- need tooth transplants -- and the new lions -- the Seahawks, Saints, Colts and Chargers -- haven't claimed enough significant prey to roar convincingly yet. 
The real Lions, of Motor City residence, are gastly, as usual, of course. 

   One outfit, though, appears willing and able to entertain Super Bowl aspirations, or whoever else shows up. 
The San Francisco 49ers, the GTE of 1982 and '85, sliced, diced and pureed the Cleveland Browns here Sunday night to at least stamp themselves as the NFL's team of the moment. 
For the statistical minded, the final score was 38-24. 

   The NFL's determination to count the three strike-breaker games of unhappy October memory have made records and stats shaky things in this campaign, a stew of different and slightly malodorous ingredients. 
But since the show is going on, I guess we're stuck with 'em. 
The win put the Niners' won-lost mark at 9-2 (6-2 for their "real" team), the best in the NFC West division, and dropped the Browns' to 7-4 (5-3), still the best in the AFC Central. 
Just as important to the ultimate title picture, it was achieved at the expense of the league's best defense, at least as measured by the numbers the NFL is passing around. 

   The Browns' "D," which stands for both defense and their defensive unit's "Dogs" nickname, had given up the league's fewest yards and points going in. 
But it was made to jump through hoops Sunday by Joe Montana, the Niners' magician of a quarterback. 
Now there's a man for all seasons, no matter what their pedigree. 

   Montana, you'll remember, led San Francisco to its 1982 and '85 Super Bowl wins, and might have done the same in January if he hadn't missed eight games with back surgery and seen stars early on in a playoff loss to the Giants. 
Slim of build but quick of brain and foot, he is, arguably, the GQE, which stands for Greatest Quarterback Ever, although that's another subject. 

   On Sunday, before about 60,000 home fans at Candlestick Park in better weather than the baseball Giants usually get, he completed 23 of 31 passes for 342 yards and four touchdowns. 
He also ran for 43 yards that counted and, generally, ran the Browns defense ragged. 

   "We chased him, but we couldn't slow him down. 
He made it obvious why so many rank him the best quarterback around," said Browns coach Marty Schottenheimer afterward. 

   Browns cornerback Hanford Dixon, a victim of multiple burns on Sunday, was equally generous in praising his adversary. 
"That was the best I've seen a quarterback play, ever," he said. 
"It was not a Dog Day Afternoon tonight." 
Montana tamed the Browns by keeping them off balance. 
His main target was Jerry Rice, a sleek third-year man from little Mississippi Valley State College, who caught three touchdown passes Sunday on top of three the week before against Tampa Bay. 
When the Browns became too intent on stopping Rice, Montana threw short to backs Tom Rathman and Roger Craig or tight end John Frank. 

   Rice's TD catches were of two, 30 and 29 yards, and on each he reached the end zone untouched. 
Among other things, the extraordinary effort earned him some peace and quiet on the field. 
"In the beginning, the Browns were sayin' things to me, like how they were going to shut me down. 
But after I caught a few they got quiet," he related. 
"One of 'em even told me I was a hell of a player," he added with some amazement. 

   Fullback Rathman paid a similar compliment to teammate Montana. 
"It's hard to drop a pass that's right in your hands, and that's where all of Joe's were tonight," said he. 

   "What's amazing about Joe is that he almost always makes the right choice," offered halfback Craig. 
"You'll sometimes come back to the huddle thinking 'Why didn't he throw to me? -- I was open.' 
But on the film you'll see he threw to a guy who was more open." 

   Montana's Cleveland counterpart, Bernie Kosar, also found a few receivers open on the Candlestick greensward Sunday, and for awhile he helped his mates make a game of it. 
Down 21-10 with just 2:39 left in the first half, he hit six of seven passes in an especially nice drive that pulled the Browns to within four at the break. 

   The second half was all San Fran, though. 
The Niners got a 38-yard field goal from Ray Wersching in the third quarter and a touchdown that made the score 31-17 early in quarter four on Montana's 29-yarder to Rice. 
On their next possession, the Browns felt forced to go for it on fourth-down-and-one from their own 44 yard line, but linebacker Keena Turner stopped Earnest Byner for no gain. 
The Niners put it away by responding with a rushing touchdown, of all things. 

   The loss, of course, doesn't put the Browns out of the chase. 
This is a gang that led last season's AFC championship game until the last 37 seconds against Denver, and that possesses the kind of run-pass balance on offense that teams without a Montana need. 

   "I have a feeling we'll see these guys again, and when we do we'll be readier to stop Joe," said the plucky Dixon. 
"Hey, anything we do in a rematch has got to be better than tonight."

<LEADPARA>  It's hard to say which was more surprising: that the Cincinnati Bengals
finally won, or the way they did it.;   Matt Stover, perfect on his previous
10 field-goal attempts, missed a try when the ball hit the left upright with 1
minute, 56 seconds to play. Then, sure-handed Brian Brennan dropped a
touchdown pass. Finally, Eric Thomas blocked Stover's 34-yard attempt with
time running out to preserve a 23-21 victory over the Cleveland Browns (4-5)
on Sunday.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BIGGEST SURPRISE IS HOW BENGALS FINALLY WIN
BROWNS' BLUNDERS GIVE CINCINNATI A HAND  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The NFL/Week 10  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The Bengals (1-8) celebrated as if they had clinched a playoff spot.;  
"Unbelievable!" offensive tackle Anthony Munoz said. "To get a win, no matter
how . . . this was a great one today.";   Kevin Mack, who scored all three
Cleveland touchdowns, fumbled the ball away at the Bengals' 16 with five
minutes left. Then Stover hit the upright on a 47-yarder.;   "I hit it great,"
Stover said. "I wouldn't take anything back except to have it go through. It
hit way up on the upright -- it could have gone through from 60. There was a
wind blowing from right to left. The ball just hooked a little bit to the
left.";   The Bengals nearly celebrated too early. After three plays and a
punt, Bernie Kosar drove the Browns to the 17. Brennan then got open in the
corner of the end zone, but Kosar's perfect pass bounced off Brennan's
shoulder with seven seconds left.;   "I just dropped the ball," Brennan said.;
  "I couldn't believe he dropped it," Thomas said. "We've had so much bad
luck, we were overdue for good luck.";   Thomas delivered it on the next play,
sprinting in from the right side to block Stover's attempt harmlessly away.;  
Cincinnati's Boomer Esiason, who sat out the previous game with a shoulder
injury, threw a 2-yard TD pass to Mike Dingle and a 34-yarder to Eddie Brown.
Harold Green ran 24 times for 135 yards.;   Kosar completed 19 of 31 passes
for 285 yards, leaving him one pass shy of Bart Starr's NFL-record 294 passes
without an interception.;   "The records are nice when you get a lot older,"
Kosar said, "but right now I don't take much consolation in that."; BENGALS
23, BROWNS 21; (box) THE HERO: Eric Thomas blocked a 34-yard field-goal
attempt with time running out to preserve the victory.;   (box) THE GOAT: Matt
Stover, whose kick Thomas blocked, also missed a 47-yard field-goal try with
1:56 to play.;   (box) KEY PLAY: Cleveland's Brian Brennan dropped what would
have been a 17-yard touchdown pass from Bernie Kosar late in the game.  </TEXT>

NAMES AND NUMBERS

<TEXT>
<P>
The New England Patriots set some standards they probably would have wanted to 
avoid in their 37-7 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Patriots set a team 
record with their 10th consecutive defeat, a feat performed in front of the 
smallest crowd in the NFL so far this season. The attendance of 26,280 undercut 
the previous low of 28,924 for the Indianapolis Colts' game at New England Nov. 
11. Kansas City also set an NFL record with its sixth blocked punt. The victory 
was Kansas City's fourth in its past five games. Stephone Paige scored on an 
86-yard pass play from Steve DeBerg on the Chiefs' first play from scrimmage. 
It was Paige's longest reception in his eight-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals' 16-12 victory over Pittsburgh denied Steeler Coach 
Chuck Noll his 200th regular-season victory in 22 seasons. It was Cincinnati's 
sixth consecutive victory over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffalo Bills sacked Philadelphia quarterback Randall Cunningham six times 
in a 30-23 victory, ending the Eagles' winning streak at five games. Jim Kelly, 
with 334 yards passing, had his first 300-yard passing day of the season. James 
Lofton caught five of his passes for 174 yards to move into third place on the 
all-time receiving yardage list with 11,889, passing Don Maynard. Cunningham 
threw the NFL's longest touchdown of the season, a 95-yarder to Fred Barnett, 
but the Bills' heavy pass rush kept him from bringing Philadelphia back. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett ended a string of three games without a touchdown with four 
touchdown passes in the Rams' 38-23 victory over the Cleveland Browns. Henry 
Ellard led Ram receivers with six catches for 90 yards, giving him a 
team-record 402 receptions. He broke Tom Fears' record of 400. The loss was 
Cleveland's sixth in a row at home, a team record. 
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde passed for 351 yards in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 23-17 
victory over Atlanta, handing the Falcons their fifth consecutive defeat and 
their 17th consecutive loss on the road. The victory ended the Buccaneers' 
six-game losing streak. Willie Drewrey's 89-yard touchdown reception from 
Testaverde was the longest in Tampa Bay history, breaking the record of 84 
yards from Doug Williams to Kevin House against Detroit in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Butler's field goal with 33 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter 
against Detroit was the 128th of career and tied him for the team record with 
Bob Thomas. Chicago quarterback Jim Harbaugh has thrown 146 consecutive passes 
without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's Art Monk caught 10 passes in the Redskins' victory over Miami, 
giving him 112 consecutive games with at least one reception. Gary Clark caught 
three passes to give him 402 receptions in six NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
With three receptions for 25 yards against Dallas, New Orleans wide receiver 
Eric Martin became the Saints' all-time leader in receiving yards. He has 321 
receptions for 4,890 yards, breaking the record of 4,875 yards in 309 
receptions set by Danny Abramowicz. Saint kicker Morten Anderson has scored in 
106 consecutive games. He kicked field goals of 43 and 50 yards and had one 
extra point. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Marion Butts gained 159 yards in 26 carries against the New York 
Jets to become the seventh player in Charger history to rush for more than 
1,000 yard in a season. He has 1,154 yards this year. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Johnson's 42-yard field goal in overtime gave Seattle a 13-10 victory over 
the Houston Oilers. It was the fourth time the Seahawks had their game decided 
on the final play. They've won three of them, including a 13-10 victory at San 
Diego last Sunday on Johnson's 40-yard field goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ROLE REVERSALS 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday, the Miami Dolphins had the leading defense in the NFL; the 
Cincinnati Bengals' defense was No. 26 in the league. Chances are they'll be 
ranked a little closer this week. Earnest Byner ran for 157 yards and three 
touchdowns and the Washington Redskins riddled the Dolphins for 467 total yards 
in a 42-20 victory. The Redskins, who had three consecutive long scoring drives 
to take a 21-0 lead, had 222 rushing yards against a defense that had been 
giving up only 85 a game. Byner became the first player to rush for more 100 
yards against the Dolphins. Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien almost doubled the 
Miami season total for passing touchdowns allowed. Rypien threw three touchdown 
passes; the Dolphins had only given up four and had not allowed a touchdown 
through the air in five games. 
</P>
<P>
At Pittsburgh, the Steelers made the Bengals look their best, again. The 
Steelers had apparently righted their early-season offensive problems more than 
a month ago with one-sided victories over the Rams and Atlanta Falcons. Then 
they played the Bengals and were held without a touchdown in a 27-3 loss. The 
next week, the Steelers got back on track with a 24-7 victory over the Jets 
before Sunday's rematch with the Bengals. Cincinnati prevented a touchdown 
again with a 16-12 victory. The Steelers haven't scored a touchdown against the 
Bengals in 11 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller suffered a broken right clavicle in the third 
quarter against New Orleans and probably will not be able to throw for four or 
five months, Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville said. . . . Pittsburgh tackle Tunch 
Ilkin, sidelined for a month with a dislocated elbow, left in the third quarter 
against Cincinnati with a bruised back. . . . Detroit cornerback Bruce McNorton 
suffered a broken left arm in the first half against Chicago. . . . Phoenix 
running back Johnny Johnson left the game against Indianapolis in the second 
quarter after aggravating a twisted right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BRADSHAW FACTOR 
</P>
<P>
Former Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback Terry Bradshaw minced no words on "The 
NFL Today" on CBS before the Rams played the Browns at Cleveland Stadium. 
Bradshaw questioned the wisdom of Bernie Kosar's complaining about the 
dedication of his teammates and the Browns' management after last Sunday's 
30-13 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Bradshaw indicated he believed a player in a 
leadership position who takes a tack such as Kosar's could have a more 
detrimental effect on a team than help it, and he predicted a blowout victory 
for the Rams, who handed the Browns their seventh consecutive defeat, 38-23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EASY MARK 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas, who began the day with a league-leading 
15 sacks, didn't play in the Chiefs' 37-7 victory over the New England Patriots 
at Foxboro, Mass. He rested a knee he injured last Sunday in a 27-24 victory 
over the Raiders. Apparently, the Chiefs didn't miss Thomas' contributions. 
Despite his absence, the Chiefs applied pressure on New England quarterback 
Tommy Hodson all day and sacked him six times. They lead the league with 42 
sacks this season. Defensive ends Bill Maas and Neil Smith had two sacks each. 
Hodson completed 20 of 39 passes for 211 yards, but he also had two passes 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
New England Coach Ron Rust, after the Patriot's team-record 10th loss in a row, 
37-7 to the Kansas City Chiefs, was asked if his team had reached its low-water 
mark of the season: "I hope it is. I thought we hit it a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief quarterback Steve DeBerg, who passed for 312 yards in the first two 
quarters against the Patriots: "That's as well as I've ever seen an offense 
function for a full half." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's Seth Joyner, who intercepted a pass late in the 30-23 loss to 
Buffalo then fumbled the Eagles' chances away when he tried to lateral the ball 
to a teammate: "We're an opportunistic defense, an opportunistic team. We live 
by the sword and we die by the sword. Today, it didn't work for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's Bubby Brister, after a 16-12 loss to Cincinnati gave the Bengals 
a one-game lead over Pittsburgh in the AFC Central: "It's not over. If we win 
the rest of our games, we're 10-6 and that might be good enough to win the 
division. But everybody's angry: I'm angry, Chuck's (Noll) angry, the whole 
team's angry. We had too many opportunities to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle kicker Norm Johnson, after his field goal in overtime gave the 
Seahawks a 13-10 victory over Houston, the fourth Seattle game this season 
decided on the last play: "I kicked two field goals and an extra point and I'm 
completely exhausted. These kinds of games wear you out, even if you're a 
kicker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OOPS, GREAT CALL! 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Coach Mike Ditka's decision in overtime first looked like a blunder, 
then turned out fine in the Bears' 23-17 victory over the Detroit Lions. The 
Bears, who had tied the score, 17-17, on Kevin Butler's 19-yard field goal with 
33 seconds left in the fourth quarter, decided to defend the north goal and get 
a strong wind at their back. The Lions drove to the Chicago 17-yard line. Eddie 
Murray made a genius of Ditka and missed a field-goal attempt from 35 yards. 
The Bears then picked up three first downs before Jim Harbaugh and Neal 
Anderson connected on a 50-yard pass play for a touchdown and the victory. Said 
Ditka: "This isn't good for my health. We were fortunate, and sometimes in life 
you have to be fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIVALRY REBORN 
</P>
<P>
Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh, former first-round draft picks who battled for a 
starting position with the Dallas Cowboys, went head to head as opposing 
quarterbacks. The Cowboys' Aikman and Walsh, traded to the New Orleans Saints 
two months ago, were nearly identical statistically, but Aikman prevailed in a 
17-13 victory. He directed the Cowboys on two 80-yard touchdown drives in the 
second half. "Troy was just excellent," said Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson. "Troy 
made some great plays . . . and, for the first time in 14 games, had no 
interceptions." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh completed 18 of 27 passes for 177 yards and no touchdowns; Aikman 
completed 15 of 21 for 177 yards and one touchdown. There were no 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE EASY WAY 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers clinched their division championships 
Sunday off the field. The 49ers won the NFC West title when the New Orleans 
Saints were beaten by the Dallas Cowboys. After Chicago defeated the Detroit 
Lions in an afternoon game, the Minnesota Vikings defeated Green Bay at night. 
That victory gave the Bears the NFC Central championship.

AS SEASON SORTS OUT WINNERS AND LOSERS, 49ERS STILL NFL'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 10 games, the 28-team NFL field has sorted itself out so neatly that all 
six division races have a clear leader; strengths and weaknesses are 
well-defined; and the teams with enough youth and depth to withstand key 
injuries have come to the fore. The playoff contenders are leaving the 
backstretch, and as New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells said, "Now is when 
you've got to start thinking about the stretch run." 
</P>
<P>
That goes for NFL writers, too. Here is one man's analysis of each division and 
the wild-card situation: 
</P>
<P>
* NFC East -- The Giants should win it. Think of their 31-10 loss to the Los 
Angeles Rams as something comparable to a necessary correction in the stock 
market. It's a 16-game season, and the Giants were due for an off game after 
several weeks of peak performance. Parcells is pushing the right buttons, and 
the Philadelphia Eagles are two games back and playing poorly on offense. The 
true measure of the Giants will come in Weeks 12-14 when they play at San 
Francisco, home against the Eagles and at Denver. The Rams? They will have a 
tough time winning a divisional playoff game in January at Giants Stadium -- if 
they get that far. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC Central -- The Minnesota Vikings' pass rush is on a record-setting pace 
with 50 sacks, just 22 short of the NFL record set in 1984 by the Chicago 
Bears. But they still are muddling around on offense, trying to figure out how 
to use Herschel Walker, and their lone divisional loss was to the Bears. Only 
one of the Vikings' six remaining opponents has a losing record, so the Bears 
still have a shot. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC West -- The 49ers easily are the class of the league and have the best 
chance of any team to repeat as Super Bowl champs since the 1978-79 Pittsburgh 
Steelers. They're determined to prove they can win without former Coach Bill 
Walsh. His successor, George Seifert, has filled those big shoes, if not the 
big ego, admirably. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC wild-card situation -- The Bears-Vikings loser in the NFC Central should 
gain one wild-card berth. The Eagles, Rams and New Orlans Saints will battle 
for the other spot. The Rams have the most talent, but if the Saints complete a 
sweep of the season series with the Rams at home in Week 12, they will be in a 
strong position. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC East -- Buffalo has a rugged schedule, but the Bills' defense and 
quarterback Jim Kelly are up to it. Week 15 may provide a Super Bowl preview 
when the Bills visit the 49ers. The Dolphins have a soft schedule, but Miami is 
the only team with a winning record that has given up more points than it has 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC Central -- Bud Carson's Cleveland Browns have the No. 1 defense against 
scoring in the NFL, and they have fashioned an adequate running game with the 
emergence of rookie running back Eric Metcalf. They are capable of winning the 
division, but it might go down to the final game of the season at Houston. The 
Cincinnati Bengals will struggle to finish above .500. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC West -- The Broncos all but clinched it with a win over the Kansas City 
Chiefs for a three-game lead. They will be tough if they earn the home field 
advantage throughout the playoffs, especially since former Los Angeles Raiders 
Coach Mike Shanahan is working with quarterback John Elway again. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC wild-card situation -- The second-place finisher between the Browns and 
Oilers in the AFC Central will get one spot. The Dolphins have the inside track 
for the other but may stumble in two games with the Chiefs. If that happens, 
the Bengals or Raiders could sneak in. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC playoffs -- No one will stop the 49ers, but the Giants have the best 
chance if they can keep Ottis Anderson and the running game going strong enough 
to set up Phil Simms' passing in the playoffs. The Vikings have the talent but 
seem to lack the chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC playoffs -- The Bills are the best all-round AFC team, but the 
sentimental choice, the Browns, will pull off a couple of playoff upsets to 
reach New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
* Super Bowl -- The preseason choice here hasn't changed: 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from newspapers in Raleigh, N.C., and Atlanta that the New York Jets 
have contacted Duke Coach Steve Spurrier as a potential replacement for Coach 
Joe Walton don't necessarily mean the Jets are ready to make a move. After the 
1987 season, they explored the idea of hiring Carl Peterson, who since has 
become the Chiefs' president and general manager, but decided against making a 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, it will be surprising if the Jets don't recognize the 
need for change this time around and if they don't also research the top NFL 
assistants, as well as college coaches. Of course, it would help if they had a 
football man in charge of the search. 
</P>
<P>
No one should question the courage of Jets QB Ken O'Brien because he failed to 
go headfirst into Dolphins safety Louis Oliver at the goal line in one of the 
key plays of a 31-23 loss. If things were going well for the Jets and O'Brien, 
he certainly would have reacted differently. His instinct to avoid the hit 
showed not a lack of toughness, but rather that O'Brien has taken such a 
pounding in a 2-8 season that he is like a fighter bobbing and weaving and 
trying to survive with his back against the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the "next Lawrence Taylor" is over now that rookie outside 
linebacker Derrick Thomas has arrived with the Chiefs. He's stronger against 
the run than the Bills' Cornelius Bennett and a more consistent pass rusher. 
"He's in that class of player," Pro Bowl safety Deron Cherry said of Thomas. 
"They threw him in the fire from the first day. He had to learn or look bad, 
and he doesn't like to look bad." 
</P>
<P>
Eagles QB Randall Cunningham, whose receivers dropped 11 passes in a 10-3 loss 
to the Washington Redskins, heard boos from the Philadelphia crowd, which is no 
surprise. "The fans are used to seeing a high-powered offense," Cunningham 
said. Hinting he would like to be turned loose to throw more, he added, "I 
can't boo." 
</P>
<P>
Cowboys cornerback Everson Walls, a former Pro Bowl player, said Coach Jimmy 
Johnson's plan to give more playing time to Issiac Holt is the first step 
toward getting rid of Walls. Walls was responsible for giving up a 
fourth-quarter TD pass in a 24-20 loss to Phoenix, and Johnson shouted at him 
for talking to his friends on the Cardinals after the game. Said Walls: "He 
embarrassed me. Only college coaches and Mike Ditka do that ... I guess they'll 
Plan B me." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Lions Coach Wayne Fontes on his 2-8 team's 31-22 upset of the Green Bay 
Packers, who held a 31-8 advantage in first downs and out-gained the Lions 432 
yards to 128: "We lost to ... uh ... won against a good football team. I almost 
slipped there. I've gotten used to that word."

<LEADPARA>  Four 49ers -- quarterback Joe Montana, wide receiver Jerry Rice, safety Ronnie
Lott and outside linebacker Charles Haley -- were named to the Associated
Press All-Pro team Thursday.;    The team was selected by a panel of 80
sportswriters and broadcasters who cover the NFL.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Rice, the fourth player in league history to catch at least 100 passes in a
season, led all players with 78 votes.;    Montana was named to the team for a
third straight season. Rice and Lott were both repeaters.;    Notably missing
from the first team were Houston quarterback Warren Moon and linebackers Mike
Singletary of Chicago and Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants.;    Moon led
the NFL in passing yardage with 4,689 and had a league-high 33 touchdown
passes. Singletary was on six previous first teams and Taylor had made it
eight times.; SHOFNER WON'T COACH: Jim Shofner will not return as Cleveland
Browns head coach next season but will be the team's director of player
personnel.;    Shofner's duties under the newly created position will include
evaluating Browns players as well as others in the NFL and in the college
ranks, team owner Art Modell said in a release.;    Shofner, 55, became
interim head coach in November after Bud Carson was fired.;    Team officials
said a new coach probably won't be named until next month.; ETC.: For the
second time this season, Pittsburgh Steelers running back Tim Worley said he
would welcome a trade. Worley was unhappy with Coach Chuck Noll's suggestion
this week he might move fullback Merril Hoge to halfback, Worley's position.
"That's telling you I'm not needed here," Worley said. . . . All-America
offensive lineman Ed King said he will give up his final year of eligibility
at Auburn and enter the NFL draft. King, a 6-foot-4, 285-pound junior guard,
was a semifinalist for the Lombardi Award and the Outland Trophy.  </TEXT>

CARSON HAS REASON FOR HIRING EX-JET AIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Returning Sunday to Giants Stadium to stand across the carpet from the 
strangers wearing Jets green is bound to be an odd sensation for Browns Coach 
Bud Carson and four ex-Jets assistants. It will be like visiting an old home 
and being surprised at the changes made by the new tenants and maybe even a 
little sad at the thought of what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
Carson and assistant head coach Dan Radakovich left the Jets a year ahead of 
the broom that swept out former Coach Joe Walton and the rest of his staff at 
the end of last season. Without those two to prop up Walton, the Jets collapsed 
in a 4-12 heap, while Carson and Radakovich ended their season in the AFC 
championship game at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Walton and most of his '89 assistants scattered on the four winds to 
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New England, Phoenix and San Diego. Three are out of 
the NFL. But Carson hired three other coaches who shared the Jets' foxhole with 
him: quarterbacks coach Zeke Bratkowski, defensive coordinator Jim Vechiarella 
and defensive backs coach Mike Faulkiner. 
</P>
<P>
While Carson's hirings have been criticized by some as an example of the 
old-boy network in the NFL, a closer look would show the five ex-Jets now with 
the Browns formed the nucleus of a very talented coaching staff hired by 
Walton. It's not difficult to imagine how much different things might have 
turned out for the Jets if Walton had been dismissed two years earlier and 
Carson promoted to the head job. 
</P>
<P>
The record shows Walton had three losing seasons (18-30) without Carson and 
Radakovich and a record of 35-27-1 when they were on his staff from 1985-88. 
The arrival of Carson and Radakovich probably saved Walton's job after he took 
over a team that went to the AFC title game following the 1982 season and had 
two straight 7-9 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely, it turned the team around," Radakovich said recently. "We went to 
the playoffs the first two years. But like anywhere else, you run out of 
players or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets ran out of whatever it is that causes talent and coaching to mix in 
just the right way to produce a winning record. That's the combination Carson 
was trying to put together when he added Bratkowski, Vechiarella and Faulkiner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a case of going out and hiring every guy you like, although a 
lot of people have accused us of that," said Carson, who has 13 assistants. 
"It's chemistry I'm interested in -- whether people work well together and how 
they work together on game day, what they do on the practice field. Are they 
on-field coaches, off-field coaches? That's what I'm interested in." 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived in Cleveland, offensive coordinator Marc Trestman already was 
in place. But Carson assumed greater control by firing Trestman and making over 
his staff with a distinct Jets flavor. "Bud interviewed other coaches," 
Radakovich said, "but he thought they were the best people available for the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, some strong bonds were formed while they were with the Jets. "Bud, 
Zeke and 'Vech' lived together for about two years in Point Lookout," said 
former Jets quarterback Pat Ryan, who spent some time in the Browns' training 
camp this summer. "They sat up and talked football plenty of times. They're a 
tight group." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL coaching fraternity is a small world, and some of the ties that bind 
the ex-Jets go back even further. Carson and Radakovich spent time together 
with the great Steelers of the early '70s, as well as the Rams and Jets. 
Vechiarella coached with Carson for the Rams, Chiefs and Jets, and Bratkowski 
and Carson endured a year of 0-8-1 hell under Frank Kush with the Colts in 
1982. When Walton promoted Faulkiner to defensive backs coach with the Jets, it 
was Carson who served as his mentor. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkiner, who also is an excellent talent scout, offered these sketches of his 
fellow assistants: 
</P>
<P>
Radakovich: "He doesn't like to admit it because he likes to coach linebackers, 
but the best thing he does is coach the offensive line." Injuries and 
retirement have destroyed the Browns' line, which means "Bad Rad" faces a big 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Bratkowski: "He's very low-key but fundamentally sound. I think you'll see an 
improvement with Bernie Kosar, even though he's been in the playoffs five years 
in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Vechiarella: "He was an excellent defensive coordinator with good schemes at 
Tulane with Larry Smith. When Smith went to Arizona, he used Vech's defense, 
and it helped him get the USC job." 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, Faulkiner knows his strength is in how he relates to people. "I 
was as honest as I could be with guys, but I also had fun with it," said 
Faulkiner, whose needle was extremely sharp and punctured many an ego. 
</P>
<P>
Developing an understanding of each other is vital to the success of a coaching 
staff. During the football season, it's as though they are in a dark bunker 
with their videotapes and chalkboards, emerging into the light only on Sunday 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's assistants know they are working for an ex-Marine whose emotional ups 
and downs can be difficult to handle. But they accept his style because they 
know he's a brilliant coach who gets results. 
</P>
<P>
"Bud's record speaks for itself," said Faulkiner. "I haven't seen him change as 
a head coach. He has the title, but he's the same Bud." 
</P>
<P>
In 17 previous NFL seasons, Carson has been with 12 playoff teams, including 
eight division winners, three teams that reached the Super Bowl and two that 
won it. Although Walton sometimes argued with Carson over which personnel to 
keep in the game, he was smart enough to give him free rein to run the defense. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the job Carson did camouflaged the Jets' weaknesses. Faulkiner 
recalls the Jets' 8-7-1 record in 1988 when the defense had 45 sacks and 24 
interceptions while starting two rookies and a converted wide receiver in the 
defensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't that good," Faulkiner said. "I think Joe put a lot of pressure on 
himself last year. He thought we were going to win 10 games. We got off to a 
bad start, and things snowballed." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Faulkiner had an argument with Walton in which the two almost 
came to blows before Faulkiner stalked out. That was a moment he regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"Walton let the coaches do their job," Faulkiner said. "I look back at that 
blowup and hope it didn't have anything to do with us being run out. I hope the 
organization didn't say, 'The coaches are losing it."' 
</P>
<P>
The record will show that one man lost control, but when that man is at the 
top, everybody goes down with him. Then, they all move on. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the survivors with the Browns won a game against the Steelers, 
whose offense is under Walton's command. This Sunday, the band of ex-Jets 
recruited by Carson visits a place they used to call home. They won't recognize 
it.

BUD CARSON MAKES BELIEVERS OF BROWNS' FANS WITH IMPRESSIVE DEBUT 
</P>

<P>
If Bud Carson ever wrote down his philosophy of life, it probably would come 
out sounding something like Murphy's Law: If something can go wrong, it will, 
and it will go wrong at the worst possible moment. So, as he was standing on 
the sidelines during his NFL head-coaching debut Sunday at Pittsburgh's Three 
Rivers Stadium watching his Browns beat the Steelers worse than anyone ever had 
in the 57 years of their existence, Carson could not believe his eyes -- could 
not believe something so good could happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the Browns' shocking 51-0 victory, Carson Tuesday said, "It was a 
feeling of disbelief, and I was afraid it would all fall apart. We had a lot of 
fantastic luck. It was the type of thing that happens once in a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
The folks in Cleveland were no less astonished than Carson. Browns fans have 
not been quick to embrace the 58-year-old former New York Jets defensive 
coordinator who was largely unknown to them when owner Art Modell brought him 
in to replace Marty Schottenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
Schottenheimer led the Browns to four straight playoff appearances, but he 
refused to give in to Modell's desire to take a more innovative approach on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Carson caused a public furor with his aborted plan to move 
popular Pro Bowl cornerback Hanford Dixon to safety. A 1-4 -preseason record 
only heightened the skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
But the eye-opener in Pittsburgh ought to convince a few people that Carson 
knows what he's doing. He promised an attack defense, and the Browns forced 
eight turnovers, scored three defensive touchdowns and recorded seven sacks. 
The headline in the Cleveland Plain-Dealer's sports section on Monday, in type 
the size of the letter at the top of an eye chart, read simply: "51-0!" 
</P>
<P>
Knowing Carson's penchant for finding the black lining in a silver cloud, the 
Plain-Dealer's Tony Grossi wrote: "Bud Carson, that great worrywart, must be 
wondering if it's all downhill from here." 
</P>
<P>
It would be next to impossible to play better. The Steelers were held to a 
record-low 53 yards and five first downs. "It was quite evident that was not a 
normal football game," Carson said afterward. "In all categories, we played 
almost a perfect game. I've never seen a defense create as many turnovers. It 
was one of the greatest games a defense can play in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that bothered Carson about winning that way was the effect it 
had on Steelers Coach Chuck Noll, who gave Carson his start in the NFL in 1972. 
It was Carson who put together the "Steel Curtain" defense for the first two of 
Noll's four Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck is a good friend," Carson said. "A 7-6 win might've been better." The 
touching thing was that he meant it. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's emotions, which he always wears on his sleeve on game day, should be 
running just as high Sunday at Cleveland Stadium for the Browns' home opener 
against the Jets (0-1). Not that he has anything against the Jets. In fact, 
Carson has always been grateful to Coach Joe Walton for resurrecting his career 
by hiring him in 1985 after a year out of football. But it's a matter of pride. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be another (emotional game)," Carson said. "But they all count one, no 
matter who they are. You can't afford to make any game too big for your 
football squad." 
</P>
<P>
The battle of wits between Carson, who calls all the defensive signals, and 
Walton will be an intriguing one. All of the Jets' offensive weapons will not 
be at Walton's disposal because of injuries to wide receivers Al Toon and 
Wesley Walker, so, Carson goes in with a clear advantage. 
</P>
<P>
No one is better at putting together a defensive game plan than Carson, which 
explains the difference between the Browns' indifferent preseason performance 
and their remarkable display against the Steelers, who had injury problems on 
the offensive line that Carson exploited. 
</P>
<P>
"We had not played well in the preseason, and I was concerned," Carson 
admitted. "Of course, we really hadn't game-planned because we were trying to 
find out who the football players were." 
</P>
<P>
During the week before the opener, Carson finally resolved the uproar over 
Dixon's status by returning him to cornerback. The 30-year-old seemed to have 
lost a step in the past year, which was one reason Carson moved him to free 
safety. Early in training camp, Carson, who is known for his honesty, said 
Dixon was "showing slippage." That remark, for which Carson apologized, caused 
most of the trouble. In fact, Carson says it actually was Dixon's idea to move 
to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to be a safety; I think he talked to (49ers safety) Ronnie Lott at 
the Pro Bowl," Carson said. "I was trying to let him do that. I moved him back 
to cornerback because he looked completely different than when I first watched 
him. He just was a very slow starter. He can still run, or, I wouldn't have put 
him back. There's no question in my mind that I made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
As harsh as Carson can be at times with his blunt criticism, his players know 
and appreciate the fact that he accepts his share of the blame when things go 
wrong. When someone asked him Sunday if Dixon's return to cornerback were 
permanent, Carson replied, "Hanford is the cornerback until I screw it up again 
and move him back." 
</P>
<P>
If Carson's honesty has offended some people or gotten him into trouble along 
the way, it also is the quality that caused so many associates to speak up for 
him last January when they heard that he had a shot at the Browns' job. Former 
Steelers greats Mel Blount, Jack Ham and Andy Russell made unsolicited calls to 
Modell to put in a good word. So did Steelers owner Dan Rooney, former Rams 
general manager Don Klosterman and Jets owner Leon Hess. 
</P>
<P>
"Leon Hess called and talked about Bud Carson the man," Modell recalled. "He 
said, 'You will not find a finer man."' 
</P>
<P>
Modell hired Carson with the expectation that he could get the Browns to the 
Super Bowl, but in a way, the pressure is no more than Carson put on himself in 
all the years he spent grinding to get a head job. His days of wondering and 
wandering to seven NFL teams are over. Cleveland is the final stop. "This is 
it," Carson said. "I'm not going anyplace else to coach football. I promised 
that to my wife, Linda. She's sick of moving, and I am, too."

WILL RAM OPPORTUNITY KNOCK?

The question is whether a team of opportunists, the Rams, can win Sunday when 
the San Francisco 49ers are at the top of their game -- when they are more 
effective, offensively, than they were at any time in the 1980s, during which 
they won three Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
After last week's games in Candlestick Park and Giants Stadium, the most 
pertinent answers came from two of the better players on the losing teams: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NFL's defensive player of the year, tackle Keith Millard of the 
Minnesota Vikings, said: "(The 49ers) won't be beaten the rest of the year. It 
doesn't matter who they play." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gary Reasons of the New York Giants, one of the NFL's steadiest 
linebackers, said: "I don't see the Rams beating the 49ers right now. They 
didn't play well enough (last Sunday) to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
What's happened in San Francisco lately is that quarterback Joe Montana and his 
teammates and their coaches -- all of them handpicked by former coach Bill 
Walsh -- have raised offensive football to a new level. 
</P>
<P>
Probably no other 49er offensive team -- perhaps no offensive group anywhere, 
any time -- could have done what the 49ers did to a great defensive team in the 
first half Sunday: four Montana touchdown passes and 95 yards running by 
halfback Roger Craig for a 27-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
That was Walsh football. Same system. Same team. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that as coached by George Seifert, the 49ers have been 
even better. The reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their main players are more mature. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As a team, they have been relatively injury-free this season, improbably, 
for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And unlike most defending Super Bowl champions, their players are all 
highly motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Said 49er safety Tom Holmoe: "There are a lot of guys here who would like to 
see how we do without (Walsh)." 
</P>
<P>
That, no doubt, is most of it. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter last Sunday, the 49ers were ahead by only 7-3 when the 
Vikings outguessed them and blanketed Montana's primary receiver at the 
Minnesota eight-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, 49er tight end Brent Jones, who was racing left at the left 
hash mark, looked back at Montana, saw the problem and changed direction 
instantly, racing laterally to his right through the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, Montana rolled right at high speed and, shortly before rolling 
out of bounds, whipped the ball to Jones shortly before he ran out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The play had the look of The Catch in 1981 when a similar running pass to wide 
receiver Dwight Clark defeated Dallas in the last minute of the NFC title game 
and launched the 49ers' Super Bowl dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
It had that look -- but it was much different. The Catch came on a designed 
play, with Clark lined up at right end. The Montana-Jones pass came on a broken 
play. 
</P>
<P>
When the ball is in Montana's hands these days, the 49ers are so smooth that 
everything they do seems to have been rehearsed all year. As it usually has. 
They practice broken patterns at greater length than some college teams 
practice passing. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are a more conventional big-play passing team than the 49ers, and 
their quarterback, Jim Everett, is a more assertive passer than Montana. Under 
pressure, he is more likely than Montana to throw the ball to receivers who may 
be faster than San Francisco's, Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Everett has demonstrated, in any case, that he belongs on the same field with 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
One difference this season is that Everett's team has, on the whole, been more 
opportunistic. The Rams have suddenly taken charge of five or six games when 
all seemed lost. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, in last week's Ram game, the Giants began the first half with 
two field-goal drives, then began the second half with an 82-yard touchdown 
drive. That would have been good for a 13-0 lead -- possibly insurmountable -- 
if Giant Coach Bill Parcells hadn't blundered shortly before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to criticism that he is too conservative, Parcells called for a pass 
at the Giant 20 -- with 34 seconds left -- instead of asking quarterback Phil 
Simms simply to kneel down. The Giants weren't going anywhere even if they had 
completed it. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams intercepted and scored on the next play when the Giant defense, which 
wanted only to throttle Parcells, couldn't get its heart into a rush on 
Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells' call will be rehashed interminably in New York, taking its place with 
the Joe Pisarcik play a dozen years ago. That time, instead of asking 
quarterback Pisarcik to kneel down with the ball as time ran out, the Giants 
ran it, fumbled and lost the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants are a kneeling-down team, not a passing team. When you forget who 
you are, the Anaheim opportunists are going to make you pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
In Denver Sunday, the Cleveland Browns will be the sentimental favorite of 
those who don't want to see the Broncos in the Super Bowl again. When they were 
there in '87 and '88, they were blown out by 19 and 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns, what's more, have a chance, having come together in recent weeks. 
The return of running back Kevin Mack balances an offense that has all the 
passes -- in and out, short and long -- now that quarterback Bernie Kosar's 
elbow merely hurts without hampering him. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland defense is aging but still a force with, among others, linebacker 
Clay Matthews and defensive end Carl Hairston. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews remains the best fundamental linebacker in the league. Watching 
Matthews is like watching a clinic on playing linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
But if Bronco quarterback John Elway finally has a handle on his team's new 
offense, as it seemed last week when he passed as well as rookie Bobby Humphrey 
ran, it will be a Denver day. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for Cleveland, as it was for Pittsburgh last week, is that there is 
too little oxygen in Mile High Stadium and too much noise. 
</P>
<P>
In backing away from its noise-abatement program this season, the NFL has taken 
a strong stand in favor of unsportsmanlike conduct.

AFC: THEY GIVE SCHOTTENHEIMER HIS FIRST VICTORY OVER THE BRONCOS AFTER SIX

<TEXT>
<P>
Marty Schottenheimer insisted it was nothing personal, but his Kansas City 
Chiefs saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
After Steve DeBerg threw three touchdowns passes Sunday to lead a 31-20 victory 
over the Denver Broncos, the Chiefs all but dedicated the victory to 
Schottenheimer and his coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing said, but you could sense all week that this was a special 
one, and you know why it was special," linebacker Dino Hackett said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all grown very close to this coaching staff. We wanted it for ourselves 
and for our team, sure. But it was nice to get it for them, too. They had 
suffered some tough losses to those guys, some heart-breaking losses." 
</P>
<P>
Schottenheimer and several of his assistants came into the game 0-6 against 
Denver, including two last-minute losses in the AFC title game while he was in 
charge of the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
He finally broke through in his 100th game as a head coach as the Chiefs (9-4) 
moved a half-game ahead of the Raiders, who play at Detroit tonight, in the AFC 
West. 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with the personal thing," Schottenheimer said. "Personal 
things don't mean a lot in this game." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fourth in a row and fifth in six games for the Chiefs, 
while the defending AFC champion Broncos (3-10) lost their sixth consecutive 
game, their longest losing streak loss since a nine-game slide in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the eighth time this season the Broncos lost after leading at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"The typical things that seem to happen all year," Denver Coach Dan Reeves 
said. "We are ahead at halftime and we come out and lose the game. They did an 
excellent job of executing their game plan." 
</P>
<P>
John Elway directed Denver to two touchdowns after the Chiefs took a 7-0 lead 
on their first possession. 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg connected with Stephone Paige for 49-yard touchdown on the fifth play of 
the game when Kansas City fooled the Broncos with a flea-flicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was a touchdown coming out of the huddle," Paige said. "The play had 
been clicking so beautifully in practice, and then I saw we had exactly the 
kind of coverage we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Elway got the Broncos the lead when he threw a five-yard touchdown pass to 
Shannon Sharpe and connected with Michael Young on a 16-yard scoring play. 
Kansas City's Nick Lowery kicked a 33-yard field goal, his 14th without a miss, 
to make it 13-10 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Elway had the Broncos driving in the third quarter, but Hackett recovered 
Shannon Sharpe's fumble to turn the game around. Eight plays later Barry Word 
scored on fourth-and-goal from the one to put the Chiefs ahead for good, 17-13.

"As soon as I got the ball to secure it, I got hit and dropped the ball," 
Sharpe said.

It was 24-20 in the final minutes when, on fourth down, DeBerg threw a short 
pass to Robb Thomas, who turned it into a 27-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised on fourth and three that they went for it," Elway 
said. "It was a bold move and a great call." 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg, a 15-year veteran who completed 18 of 27 passes for 254 yards, did not 
have a pass intercepted for the eighth consecutive game.

<P>
He was not surprised by Schottenheimer's decision to go for it on 
fourth-and-three from the 27 with a little more than 2:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it showed confidence in our football team," DeBerg said. "To be 
honest, I thought we'd go for it. If I was the one making the call, I would 
have gone for it. If we make the first down, the game's over. If we make a 
touchdown the game's really over." 
</P>
<P>
Elway completed 24 of 36 passes for 328 yards and two touchdowns to keep the 
Broncos in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Denver got a scare in the second half when Elway went down with what appeared 
to be a knee injury, but he stayed in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Schottenheimer: "Everybody talks about John Elway and his great ability, 
but the one thing that people don't talk about is the single most important 
thing -- that he is as fine a competitor as I have ever seen play this game."
