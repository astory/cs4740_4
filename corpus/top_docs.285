   Rio Grande Industries Inc. received government
approval Tuesday for its $1.2 billion purchase of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, one of the nation's oldest rail lines with track
stretching from Oregon to Louisiana.
   Southern Pacific, which has 15,000 miles of track, will retain
its name and incorporate into its operations the smaller Denver &amp;
Rio Grande Western Railroad once the purchase is completed, company
officials said.
   By a 4-0 vote, the Interstate Commerce Commission gave approval
for the railroad's sale by its parent Sante Fe Southern Pacific
Corp., to Rio Grande Industries, a subsidiary of the Denver-based
Anschutz Corp.
   Philip Anschutz, owner of the privately held company, told
reporters he intends to concentrate on reducing Southern Pacific's
debts, partly through the sale of some of its real estate holdings,
and modernize the railroad's equipment and facilities.
   ``We will be in the railroad business, first and foremost,''
said Anschutz, whose background is in energy.
   Anschutz, who has a reputation of being reclusive, acknowledged
that he had never before held a news conference, but he said he
wanted to meet with reporters to set to rest unfounded ``rumors,''
including one that sought the Southern Pacific to break it up and
make a quick profit.
   ``It's very important that this company be kept together,'' he
said.
   The Anschutz Corp. purchased Rio Grande Industries four years
ago.
   William Holtman, chairman of Rio Grande Industries, expressed
confidence in Anschutz's devotion to railroading. ``He's a
long-term player,'' Holtman said of Anschutz.
   The ICC said the merger of the Southern Pacific and the Denver &amp;
Rio Grande Western railroads would have the best competitive
benefits and be in the public interest. The merger was recommended
by both the Justice Department and the Transportation Department.
   The commission last year ordered the Chicago-based Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp. to divest itself of either the Southern
Pacific or the Santa Fe railroads after it rejected a proposal to
merge the two rail lines. The company chose to sell the Southern
Pacific.
   Southern Pacific's stock has been held in a trust for nearly
five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should own
the railroad.
   ``We look forward to completing the sale, getting out of
trusteeship and moving forward again with a clear idea of Southern
Pacific's future course and direction,'' said Denman McNear,
chairman of the Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
   Anschutz said the Southern Pacific's management team would be
chosen from among the senior managers of both the Southern Pacific
and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western.
   Santa Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries
on the sale last February, but when permission for the transaction
was sought from the ICC, another railroad company, Kansas City
Southern Industries, objected and asked that it be allowed to buy
the railroad.
   But the ICC in a series of votes Tuesday turned its back on the
Kansas City Southern proposal. One concern of the ICC was Kansas
City Southern's financial outlook in light of a $600 million court
judgment that is under appeal.
   The judgment stems from antitrust and contract violations
involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in South Dakota. Kansas
City Southern had argued that the judgment would not affect its
ability to finance the Southern Pacific purchase.
   Kansas City Southern could challenge the ICC ruling in court,
but the company's president and chief executive officer, Landon
Rowland, said no decision has been made on what the next step, if
any, would be.
   ``We're not ruling out anything,'' Rowland told reporters after
the ICC vote.
   The Southern Pacific, which is rich in history, operates up and
down the West Coast and along the southern tier of the country with
tracks stretching from Portland, Ore., through central California
and across the Southwest as far east as New Orleans. It also
operates lines from San Francisco to Ogden, Utah, where it links up
with the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western, and from St. Louis to the
Gulf Coast.
   The Denver &amp; Rio Grande runs along a central corridor from Ogden
to St. Louis.
   Both railroads have been closely intertwined with the history of
the West, helping to bring in settlers, miners and industry.
   Southern Pacific's founders helped drive the golden spike in
Utah in 1869, linking the country's first transcontinental rail
line. Two years later, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande ran its first train
from Denver to Colorado Springs.
   Anschutz said the new railroad ``will operate under the banner
of Southern Pacific,'' although within the company the Denver &amp; Rio
Grande Western will continue to maintain its own identity.
   He said he decided to retain the Southern Pacific name because
it is by far the larger of the two railroads and probably better
known. ``Last of all, I like the name,'' he added.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission today
unanimously approved the sale of the Southern Pacific Railroad to
Rio Grande Industries, creating a 15,000-mile rail system that
covers 15 states from Portland, Ore., to New Orleans.
   Rio Grande Industries has agreed to buy the Southern Pacific
from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. for $1.2 billion.
   The ICC in a 4-0 vote said the merger of the Southern Pacific
and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western railroads would have the best
competitive results and be in the public interest.
   The commission last year ordered the Santa Fe Southern Pacific
Corp. to divest itself of the Southern Pacific after the rejection
of that railroad's merger with the Santa Fe.
   Santa Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries,
but when permission for the sale was sought from the ICC, another
railroad company, Kansas City Southern Industries, objected and
sought to buy Southern Pacific as well.
   But the ICC in a series of votes today turned its back on the

Industries instead.
   At a news conference, Philip Anschutz, chairman of Rio Grande
Industries, applauded the ICC decision and said the combined
railroads ``will operate under the banner of Southern Pacific.''
   He said that senior officers of the Southern Pacific will be
announced before the purchase is completed and that managers will
be drawn from the ranks of both railroads.
   The Southern Pacific also has extensive real estate holdings in
the West, but Anschutz said, ``We will be in the railroad business,

   The Southern Pacific operates up and down the West Coast and

   The Interstate Commerce Commission, ending one of the longest-running sagas in modern railroad history, refused to reconsider its 1986 rejection of the proposed merger of the Southern Pacific and Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe railroads. 

   The 4-1 vote underscored the commission's continued strong concerns about the potentially anti-competitive nature of the merger, which would have produced the nation's third-largest railroad, with more than 25,000 miles of track in the West and Southwest. 

   The action will force Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., the Chicago-based parent company of both railroads, to sell at least one of the railroads. 
The corporation was created in 1983 when Santa Fe Industries Inc. merged with Southern Pacific Co., and it has operated the two railroads separately while awaiting ICC approval. 
Last July, the commission rejected the merger. 

   The ICC, in refusing to review that decision yesterday, gave Santa Fe Southern Pacific 90 days to submit a divestiture plan. 
It is the first time in recent years that the commission ordered such a divestiture. 
The company will have up to two years to sell one of the railroads, according to commission staff members. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific's stock rose sharply yesterday, closing at $50, up $3.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
It was the most actively traded issue on the exchange, with 4.9 million shares changing hands. 
In addition, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. put the company's debt ratings under review and Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it will continue an existing review. 

   Railroad industry analysts say the collapse of the merger is likely to touch off a buying spree for portions of one or both of the railroads and could lead to creation of the nation's first coast-to-coast rail system if an Eastern railroad emerges as the buyer. 

   At a news conference immediately after the ICC vote, Landon Rowland, chief executive officer of Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., said his company would make an offer within the next 60 days to buy Southern Pacific. 
Hours later, Burlington Northern Railroad said it was "interested in acquiring segments of the Southern Pacific or the Santa Fe or both." 
In addition, some Southern Pacific managers and a rail union official separately raised the possibility of buyouts. 

   John Reed, chairman and chief executive of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., at the news conference expressed disappointment about the commission decision, but said the company wouldn't appeal it in court. 

   "Our employees have been held in suspense long enough," he said. 
"We just have to get on with our business." 
The company, he added, plans a major realignment involving a renewed focus on its "core businesses" of natural resources, petroleum and transportation, and the sale of a number of other subsidiaries. 

   Mr. Reed, in response to a question, denied that the company already has decided to sell Southern Pacific, which remains weaker than Santa Fe despite recent signs of improvement. 
"We haven't made any decision as to which railroad will be disposed of," he said. 
He added that it was "conceivable" both railroads would be sold, particularly if management failed to win more concessions from labor. 

   However, industry sources doubted that Mr. Reed, who headed the Santa Fe for 16 years, would agree easily to sell that railroad. 
And Richard Kilroy, chairman of the Railway Labor Executives Association, a group representing rail labor unions, dismissed his statement on labor concessions as "posturing." 

   Analysts estimate the value of the two railroads is as much as $3 billion. 

   The commission, in upholding its earlier rejection of the merger, overruled a staff recommendation to reopen the case. 
The staff argued that a review of the case was needed because of the numerous agreements over track rights that Santa Fe Southern Pacific made with other railroads to ameliorate competitive problems. 

   But the majority of the commissioners dismissed that argument. 
"I'm not convinced that the anti-competitive effects we identified in the initial decision have been adequately remedied," said Commissioner Malcolm Sterrett. 
Vice Chairman Paul Lamboley agreed: "I don't think there is really a change at all." 

   Some analysts believe that railroad mergers are a necessity for the railroad industry to survive, and that closing or substantially narrowing that option could cripple the industry's chances. 

   By contrast, the ICC's denial was greeted with enthusiasm at Southern Pacific. 
Many of the high-ranking executives there had given up support for the merger long ago. 
At a staff meeting to draft a news release on the commission's decision, one top manager jokingly crossed out the word "disappointed" and scribbled in "tickled" to describe Southern Pacific's reaction. 

   After several lean years, the Southern Pacific is showing some signs of rebirth, due in large part to a stabilized customer base and lower costs for fuel and labor. 
The company showed a profit in the first quarter, usually the quarter with the lowest railroad traffic of the year. 

   The railroad also recently completed a $1.3 billion track improvement program and opened a container transfer facility outside Los Angeles to handle the growing number of merchandise containers coming off ships. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific's Mr. Reed, in describing the company's plans for realignment, said the following subsidiaries would be offered for sale: Robert E. McKee, a general contractor; Bankers Leasing &amp; Financial Corp.; Santa Fe Pacific Timber Co.; Gulf Central Pipeline Co.; Chaparral Pipeline; and Black Mesa Pipeline. 

   The company, whose most valuable holdings are its $5 billion of real estate assets, also signaled that it is willing to sell some of its fully developed properties. 
These include the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles and the McDonnell Douglas Center in San Jose, Calif. 

   On the possible sale of either the Santa Fe or Southern Pacific railroads, the most intriguing possibility is that of the creation of a transcontinental rail carrier by an Eastern railroad bidder. 
The benefits of such a combination appear to be growing, reflecting the boom in coast-to-coast shipments of containerized imports from the Far East. 

   The big Eastern railroads, Norfolk Southern Corp., Consolidated Rail Corp. and CSX Corp., declined comment. 
But last May, Norfolk Southern Chairman Arnold McKinnon told analysts that "we'll look" if one of the Western railroads became available. 

   Creating a transcontinental rail system faces some problems. 
Some rail executives long have dismissed as minimal the potential cost savings and traffic gains from such combinations. 
In addition, the formation of a coast-to-coast railroad likely would spur competitors to make similar combinations, and those proposed combinations would face regulatory hurdles, including ICC review.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission heard from
two railroads Wednesday that are vying for the purchase of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, which is on the auction block because of
a failed merger attempt last year.
   The Santa Fe Pacific Corp., had agreed to sell its Southern
Pacific subsidiary to Rio Grande Industries Inc., the parent
company of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad for $1.02
billion.
   But the deal, which requires ICC approval, has run into strong
opposition from Kansas City Southern Industries, operator of the
Kansas City Southern Railroad, which has offered $1.25 billion for
the 13,000-mile rail system that stretches from Kansas City to the
West Coast.
   The ICC heard from both railroads Wednesday as it tries to
determine which buyer to choose, or whether it might approve both
applications and allow Santa Fe to choose.
   A decision is expected next month.
   Samuel Freeman, an attorney for Rio Grande Industries, told the
ICC in formal arguments that the company is in better financial
position to buy the Southern Pacific than is Kansas City Southern.
   ``The request (by Kansas City Southern that it be allowed to buy
the railroad) is unprecedented and unwarranted,'' he said.
   Rio Grande officials noted that Kansas City Southern faces a
possible $600 million settlement from a legal entanglement that
grew out of its role in the a failure of a coal slurry pipeline
project.
   Kansas City Southern, however, maintained before the ICC that it
would be the most fit buyer of the Southern Pacific, arguing that
it is offering more money and plans to invest 20 percent more funds
in the railroad than the Rio Grande.
   ``We are committed to the acquisition and rehabilitation of the
Southern Pacific,'' said Landon Rowland, president of Kansas City
Southern Industries. He said the company would invest more than $4
billion in the railroad over a five-year period.
   Kansas City Southern has accused the Santa Fe Pacific Corp., of
favoring the lower Rio Grande bid because the merger would benefit
the Santa Fe Railroad, the other rail line owned by Santa Fe
Pacific Corp.
   Jerome Donohoe, representing Santa Fe Pacific, said the company
has a binding contract with Rio Grande and could not complete the
sale this year if the ICC were to choose Kansas City Southern.
   The Southern Pacific was put up for sale under an ICC
divestiture order after the ICC last year rejected a planned merger
of the Southern Pacific with the Santa Fe.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission is expected today to approve the sale of Southern Pacific Transportation Co. to Rio Grande Industries Inc., closing a five-year controversy over the fate of one of the nation's oldest railroads. 

   The commission, meeting in Washington, D.C., is expected to approve the sale despite strenuous objections from Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., which has offered $1.25 billion in cash and notes for Southern Pacific. 
A commission official said the ICC is concerned about how a court judgment of as much as $600 million against Kansas City Southern in the state of South Dakota will affect that company's financial outlook. 

   Kansas City Southern is appealing that judgment, which stems from antitrust and contract violations involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in South Dakota. 
A Sioux Falls, S.D., federal judge last Friday said he planned to issue an order barring Kansas City Southern from completing any purchase of Southern Pacific until the South Dakota case is resolved. 

   In December, Southern Pacific's parent, Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., agreed to sell the rail unit to Rio Grande, a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp., for $1.2 billion. 
But the sale couldn't be finalized without the approval of the ICC, which rules on whether such mergers are "in the public interest" and must insure they don't pose anti-competitive problems. 

   Kansas City Southern has tried since then to prevent the sale, arguing that it's willing to invest more money in Southern Pacific than Rio Grande, and would therefore make Southern Pacific a more viable competitor among railroads in the West. 
Kansas City Southern maintains the $600 million judgment it has been ordered to pay in South Dakota would have no effect on its plans for Southern Pacific. 

   Landon Rowland, Kansas City Southern's president and chief executive officer, said a decision in favor of Rio Grande at today's ICC hearing would be "very disappointing." 
He left open the possibility that his company still may try to block the sale in the courts if it fails before the ICC. 

   The fate of the Southern Pacific, which traces its beginnings to the first transcontinental railroad, has been in abeyance since December 1983, when it was acquired by Santa Fe Southern Pacific. 
Santa Fe had hoped to merge Southern Pacific, which is based in San Francisco, with its other rail unit, the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway. 
But after four years of hearings and rehearings, the ICC rejected that proposal and ordered Santa Fe to sell off one of its rail units.

To Revised Plan for Merging Railroads

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s revised plan to create the nation's second-longest railroad still faces opposition from some competitors and regulators. 

   The plan, which was filed last week with the Interstate Commerce Commission, details the concessions the transportation and natural resources giant is willing to grant to four Western railroads. 
The railroads had objected to its plans to merge its two railway units: the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. and Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific is attempting to use the concessions to convince the ICC to reopen hearings on its three-year struggle to merge the two railroads. 
The ICC blocked the merger last July on grounds that the combined railroads would have monopolized traffic on the Pacific Coast as well as between Southern California and the Gulf Coast. 

   According to the filing, Santa Fe Southern Pacific is agreeing to let the four railroads use hundreds of miles of its track in return for similar rights. 
The arrangements strengthen the four railroads, which may in turn spur their competitors to try to derail the complicated merger plan. 

   Burlington Northern Railroad Co., the nation's largest railroad, said Friday it opposes the revised merger proposal because, among other things, it would grant its biggest Western competitor, Union Pacific Corp., access to the southwestern U.S. 
"At the least, the anti-competitive problems don't go away, and it gives Union Pacific the upper hand in the Southern corridor," said Burlington Northern spokesman Mike Wenninger. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific has reached agreements with the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co. and the Texas Mexican Railway Co. 
The company said a final agreement with the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co. is snagged over "narrow, discrete issues" that it suggests could be settled by the ICC or arbitration. 
The agreement would allow the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western to lease track in Utah, California and Oregon. 

   The Justice Department said it is looking at the concessions to determine whether they solve the anti-competitive problems raised by the original combination. 
"We are skeptical," said James R. Weiss, chief of the antitrust division's transportation, energy and agriculture section. 
"Trying to resolve (anti-competitive problems) through these fixes is difficult to do," he said. 
The Transportation Department has supported the merger of the railway units, which would encompass more than 25,000 miles of track from the Mississippi River across the West and Southwest. 

   Kansas City Southern Railway Co. has opposed the revised merger plan because it wants to buy the Southern Pacific system. 
Santa Fe Southern Pacific will have to divest itself of one of the railroad units if the ICC rejection stands. 

   This complicated railroad battle was touched off in 1983 when Santa Fe Industries Inc. merged with Southern Pacific Co. in a $6.4 billion transaction. 
The energy and natural resources operations of the two companies were immediately combined but the railroad units were kept separate pending ICC approval. 
Southern Pacific is managed independently through a trust. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific said it has drummed up support to reopen the ICC hearings from, among others, the governors of 12 states and from 1,700 companies that ship goods over the affected railroad lines. 
Interested parties have three weeks from last Thursday to file comments on Santa Fe Southern Pacific's merger petition. 

   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Santa Fe Southern Pacific shares closed at $36.625, up $1.25. 

   The concessions are an about-face for Santa Fe Southern Pacific's chairman, John J. Schmidt. 
Prior to the rejection of the merger proposal by the ICC, he had maintained that any concessions could severely damage the viability of the merger. 
Now the company is saying the concessions improve the merger. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific said Mr. Schmidt wasn't available to comment. 
A company spokesman said the trackage-rights swaps and lease agreements with the four railroads would allow the merged units to take shortcuts and trim maintenance costs, among other things. 
The petition estimates that Santa Fe Southern Pacific would save itself about $295 million annually by merging the units this way. 
Under the old plan, the company thought it would save about $288 million annually.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the $1.02 billion sale of Southern Pacific Railroad to Denver-based Rio Grande Industries Inc., spurning a competing bid from Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. 

   Rio Grande Chairman Philip Anschutz said that company's railroad unit, Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad, will be combined with Southern Pacific and run under the Southern Pacific name. 

   The new rail system, with 15,000 miles of track, will be the fifth largest in the U.S., covering 15 states west of the Mississippi River. 
It will be based in San Francisco, as Southern Pacific is now, and will have a major regional office in Denver. 

   In a 20-minute session, the commission voted 4-0 to approve Rio Grande's application to buy Southern Pacific from Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. and 4-0 to reject Kansas City Southern's. 
Heather Gradison, chairman of the commission, said the transaction would "produce substantial public benefits" without "discernible harms to competition or to essential railroad service." 

   ICC member Paul Lamboley appeared to speak for his colleagues in articulating a major argument against the Kansas City Southern bid: a pending court judgment against that Kansas City, Mo., railroad company of as much as $600 million. 
He said the prospect of the judgment clouds the company's financial outlook and would delay completion of any Kansas City Southern purchase of Southern Pacific. 

   The judgment against Kansas City Southern stems from antitrust and contract violations involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in South Dakota. 
The railroad is appealing the judgment, but a federal judge last week said he would bar Kansas City Southern from completing a purchase of Southern Pacific until the case is resolved. 

   Kansas City Southern's bid for Southern Pacific totaled $1.25 billion in cash and debentures. 
Rio Grande's bid was all cash. 

   Meanwhile, David Berger, an attorney in Philadelphia, is seeking certification from a state court in Wilmington, Del., to press a class-action suit on behalf of Santa Fe Southern shareholders. 
The suit would charge that the company's management breached its fiduciary duties in accepting the lower bid and would seek damages of at least $20 million. 

   Kansas City Southern yesterday criticized the commission's decision to approve its rival's bid, saying, "The biggest loser was the public interest." 
The railroad contended that it planned to spend $4 billion more on Southern Pacific over the next five years than Rio Grande plans to spend. 
Kansas City Southern said its bid for Southern Pacific remains "on the table." 

   The commission vote apparently ends one of the longest-running sagas in the railroad business, over the future of Southern Pacific. 
In late 1983, Santa Fe Industries, which owns Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway, bought Southern Pacific Co., owner of Southern Pacific Railroad. 
The parent companies merged their non-rail assets but operated their railroads separately pending ICC approval. 

   Last year, the commission, citing threats to competition, vetoed the rail merger and ordered Santa Fe to sell one of its railroads.

   The proliferation of double-stack container trains is igniting a rate war between truckers and railroads, benefiting shippers with lower freight rates. 

   More than 100 double-stack trains, which carry one container loaded above another, now ply the nation's long-haul east-west freight routes each week, compared with a handful five years ago. 
Double-stack rates between Chicago and Los Angeles dropped 15% in the past 12 months, as freight-hauling capacity continued to grow amid a slowdown in demand. 
Some analysts expect rates to fall further when additional trains are launched. 

   The transcontinental freight routes have become "extremely competitive," says John Koons, president of Country Wide Transport Services Inc., a truck company. 
Double-stack trains are "taking a lot of freight that used to be routed via trucks." 

   More broadly, the double-stack trains are "increasing the efficiency of U.S. freight transportation and the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers," says Gerard McCullough, deputy director of transportation studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

   The rate cutting affects long-distance east-west freight flows of more than $10 billion a year. 
Some analysts estimate that the industrywide rate drops spurred by double-stack competition are saving U.S. consumers between $500 million and $1 billion a year. 

   Among the biggest rate cuts are ones on the busy Chicago-Los Angeles corridor, where rates for some carriers plunged from about $1,500 for some of the bigger containers two years ago to $1,200 to $1,000 now. 

   Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. recently shifted some of its business away from trucks to double-stack trains because of the rate cuts and improvements in double-stack service. 
The company now ships 20 container loads a week of potato chips, peanut butter and liquid detergent from its Midwest plants to the West Coast by rail. 
In response to shipper defections, some truckers are slashing rates. 
Others are courting shippers further away from the major double-stack terminals. 
A few are fleeing transcontinental routes, focusing instead on shorter regional deliveries. 

   Country Wide is moving its headquarters from Pomona, Calif., where double-stack competition is keen, to Knoxville, Tenn. 
MNX Inc., a St. Joseph, Mo., trucker, is redeploying trucks to less competitive routes in the Southeast. 
Recently, MNX bought a shipping broker to gain access to the fast-growing double-stack market. 
Another trucker, CRST Inc., Cedar Rapids, Iowa, shelved plans to buy 50 more trucks, blaming rate declines. 

   "We're barely making money," says John Smith, president of CRST. 
"We're doing everything we can to keep costs down." 

   For decades the nation's railroads seemed helpless against trucking companies that siphoned off their most lucrative freight, leaving the rails with low-rated bulk traffic. 
They fought back with piggyback -- transporting highway trailers on flatcars -- but managed to win freight mainly from their own boxcars. 

   Double-stacks represent the "first concrete example of a new rail intermodal technology taking traffic off the highway," says Lee Lane, intermodal executive director of the Association of American Railroads. 
By some estimates, double-stacks are capturing U.S. freight shipments of more than $100 million a year from trucks. 

   By stacking two containers on special rail cars, railroads nearly double train capacity and cut rail costs 25%. 
The double-stack trains carry containers in low-slung, bathtub-shaped wells that provide a smoother ride than piggyback trains. 

   American President Cos., an Oakland, Calif.-based ocean ship line, launched the first coast-to-coast double-stack train in 1984. 
It was originally designed to speed international cargo off the company's ships on the West Coast to inland destinations. 
But to balance the heavy flow of Asian imports on its eastbound trains, the company solicited domestic freight to fill containers that would have returned empty to the West Coast. 
Later, American President expanded its trains to carry domestic freight in both directions. 

   "Our international freight volumes gave us the base to create a domestic freight system," says Donald Orris, president of the company's domestic freight unit. 

   Other ship lines, and the rail units of CSX Corp., Burlington Northern Inc. and Santa Fe Pacific Corp., have launched their own double-stack trains. 
Now they are trying to lure U.S. domestic shippers to use the the trains by ordering thousands of large-capacity containers, expanding terminals, speeding up train schedules and reducing rates. 
Currently, domestic freight accounts for about 30% of the cargo on double-stack trains and the business is growing rapidly. 

   CSX and American President have begun to dispatch their own company trucks and drivers, rather than relying on independent drivers, to move containers between shippers' loading docks and their railheads. 
That will eliminate some shipment delays, they say. 
And American President is refunding freight charges when it fails to deliver on time. 

   Double-stack operators are also making organizational changes, hiring executives from the trucking industry, for example. 
"The rails have finally realized after trial and error that to be competitive with truckers you have to think and act like a trucker," says M. McNeil Porter, a former trucking company executive who is president of CSX's CSL Intermodal unit. 

   Some shippers aren't likely to shift freight to double-stack trains any time soon. 
"Motor carriers cover more routes, give better service and their transit time is less," says Peter Brock, transportation manager of J.C. Penney Co. 
The trains are restricted, particularly in the East, by bridge and tunnel clearances. 
And shipper surveys rate trucks higher than rail intermodal service in reliability, speed, door-to-door delivery and customer responsiveness. 

   But 3M Corp., Campbell Soup Co. and General Electric Co.'s appliance division have recently switched some shipments to double-stack trains from trucks. 
One reason Procter &amp; Gamble switched some of its freight to trains from trucks is that "they use less fuel and create less pollution and that's good for the country," says Fred Morris, the company's transportation director. 

   Nabisco Foods Co. also plans to divert certain shipments to double-stacks because the company is concerned about the growing shortage of long-haul truck drivers. 
"We're trying to protect ourselves by putting as much freight on rail as we can," says William Ditoro, transportation director of the RJR Nabisco Inc. unit. 
"We're trying to wean ourselves off trucks."

To Keep a Vital Southern Pacific Line

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., under orders from the Interstate Commerce Commission to sell one of its two railroad units, is trying to persuade the regulatory agency to allow it to sell only a portion of the Southern Pacific Transportation Co., commission staff members and industry officials said. 

   Santa Fe wants to retain Chicago-based Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway, its more profitable railroad property, these sources said. 
It also wants to keep a portion of the Southern Pacific, known as the Cotton Belt line. 
The Cotton Belt, which runs from New Mexico to Kansas and from Texas to Tennesee, would provide the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe with two new gateways to the East: Memphis, Tenn., and St. Louis. 

   But such a plan would in turn rob Southern Pacific of these two cities and Kansas City, the three most important gateways on its route system. 
"It would be a dagger in the heart of the Southern Pacific," a source close to the San Francisco-based railroad said. 

   Robert D. Krebs, Santa Fe Southern Pacific's chief executive officer, said through a spokesman that the company is continuing work on a divestiture plan and that reports of the possible sale of the Cotton Belt are "premature." 

   Denman K. McNear, chairman and chief executive officer of Southern Pacific, declined to comment. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific was formed in 1983 through the merger of the two railroads' parent companies, Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Co. 
In June, it lost a four-year battle to merge the two railroad units, which had long competed for the transport of a wide range of commodities across the West and Midwest and which it continued to operate separately pending ICC approval. 
But the ICC, which denied the merger on anti-competitive grounds, ordered the railroad, energy and real estate concern to submit a divestiture plan by Sept. 28. 

   Since then, Santa Fe officials have had several meetings with ICC commissioners and staff to discuss the possible sale of parts of Southern Pacific, the industry and commission sources said. 
Although it is unclear if the commission will allow the sale of only a portion of Southern Pacific, at least one commissioner, Paul Lamboley, has criticized the Santa Fe plan as "just another attempt at a merger," a commission official said. 

   Only one company, Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., has so far publicly expressed an interest in Southern Pacific. 
But Kansas City Southern has yet to make a specific offer. 

   The Cotton Belt has been one of the more profitable routes in the Southern Pacific system. 
In the first five months of 1987, the line had revenue of $150 million, compared with $140 million in the same period of 1986. 
The Southern Pacific unit had 1986 revenue of $2.27 billion. 

   Through the Cotton Belt line and its gateways at St. Louis, Memphis, Kansas City and New Orleans, Southern Pacific trains transfer a wide range of cargo, including autos, lumber and petrochemicals, to other rail carriers for delivery to eastern cities. 
If the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe is allowed to take control of those gateways, "it would spell disaster for the Southern Pacific," an industry official said.

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said it petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission late Tuesday to reconsider the rejection of a plan to merge its two railway units -- Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway and Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 

   The appeal was expected. 
The regulatory commission blocked the proposed merger of the two railway units in July because of worries that it would hurt competition in the Southwest. 
Santa Fe Southern Pacific had until Tuesday to ask that the merger talks be reopened. 

   The railroad combination, which was the first to be rejected by the ICC in two decades, would have formed the nation's third-largest rail system. 
The two railway units have operated separately since their parents, Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Corp., combined in 1983 to form Santa Fe Southern Pacific. 
The companies' operations were combined except for the railroads, which need ICC approval to merge. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific also has interests in natural resources and forest products. 

   Since the ICC's rejection, Santa Fe Southern Pacific has been trying to win support for the merger of its units from its railroad competitors. 
Earlier this month, it agreed to give Union Pacific Corp. the right to operate on some of the units' lines, among other things. 
The agreement is similar to a September accord that gave Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad access to markets west of Ogden, Utah.

   In 1983, executives of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway devised a plan that seemed as solid as the carrier's granite track beds: create a giant new railroad by acquiring the rival Southern Pacific. 

   But four years later, one of the biggest mergers in rail history is falling apart. 
Although the parent companies have combined their assets, management errors and regulatory red tape have repeatedly delayed the blending of the two railroads, which are still held in separate units. 
Employee morale at both railroads has plunged, and contracts have been lost. 
In April, frustration over the ill-fated merger led to the ouster of Chairman John J. Schmidt. 
In California's San Joaquin Valley, stretches of track that were built to join the two railways end abruptly in the dirt. 

   But even as the two railroads and their parent, Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., struggle with these problems, a much bigger one may be about to hit. 
The Interstate Commerce Commission, which rejected the merger of the two lines in a decision last year, may vote at its scheduled meeting tomorrow to reject an appeal to reconsider the case. 
Although the agency could still change its mind, such a decision would be a consistent end to one of the most disaster-prone acquisitions in business history. 

   "It's a corporate and political mess that's positively stupefying," says William L. Withuhn, a railroad historian at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. 
He adds that he can't remember a more "complex, tragic and confused railroad merger proposal." 

   If the commission does the unexpected and reopens the case, the review could last for years. 
That would probably be worse for the company than to bring the matter to a close now. 

   The failure of the merger could significantly alter the railroad map in the Westand possibly beyond. 
In addition to their colorful histories, both lines are major rail links. 
The Santa Fe's greatest strength is its high-speed route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which Judy Garland helped immortalize in the Johnny Mercer/Harry Warren song "On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe." 
The Southern Pacific, meanwhile, carries major quantities of the nation's lumber, produce, chemicals and merchandise containers. 
It also played a major role in developing California and was once the state's biggest private landowner. 

   An ICC decision would probably include an order for the parent company to immediately divest itself of at least one of the railroads. 
Although the two carriers might be able to operate independently for some time, it is more probable that one or both would be sold to other railroads either as single entities or in pieces. 
In fact, one of the lines could end up in the hands of an East Coast railroad, forming the nation's first transcontinental carrier at a time when coast-to-coast rail traffic is surging because of heavy container traffic from Japan and the Far East. 

   The two railroads may have been the victims of bad timing. 
A few years before their proposed combination, the ICC had easily approved the big mergers that created the Norfolk Southern, the CSX and the Union Pacific. 
In arguing their case, the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific maintained, among other things, that the earlier decisions entitled them to similar treatment. 
And many in the industry believed that the proposal would fly through all government hearings with little problem. 

   But when the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific brought their case, the ICC was under increasing pressure from Congress to re-regulate the railroad industry. 
In addition, the carriers may have been overconfident. 
In any case, they presented a case that was filled with contradictions and errors. 
"It was an ecstasy of fumbling," says an ICC official. 
Commissioner Malcolm M.B. Sterrett adds that the hearing record was "replete with self-contradictory testimony, omissions and fuzziness." 

   The Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific started discussing a merger in the summer of 1980. 
But talks broke off after the two sides failed to agree on a price or a plan. 
One problem was a personality clash between the two railroads' leaders. 
John Shedd Reed, the Yale-educated chairman of the Santa Fe, was known for his genteel style. 
Benjamin Biaggini, the strong-willed Louisianian who headed the Southern Pacific, liked to play tough. 
Once, in the middle of a bumpy rail trip, he stopped the train and ordered the manager responsible for track maintenance to get off and stay out of the office until the tracks had been repaired. 

   In 1983 Mr. Reed retired, and his successor, John Schmidt, almost immediately resurrected the idea of a merger. 
Deregulation had led to a wave of big railroad combinations, and Mr. Schmidt, a lawyer with a deep concern for the bottom line, was worried about the consequences of being left out. 
This time, Mr. Biaggini agreed. 

   The two companies were so confident of success that they merged their parent companies - including their real-estate, pipeline, mineral and timber interests -- without waiting for the ICC to complete its review. 
Because federal law forbids merging railroads without ICC approval, they left the two carriers in separate subsidiaries. 
But they began repainting the locomotives with the red and yellow color scheme of the merged railroad. 

   From an antitrust standpoint, railroad merger cases tend to be complicated because they involve a wide range of interested parties from many locations. 
Until 1976, when Congress imposed a 31-month time limit on ICC merger proceedings, some rail cases dragged on interminably. 
Many in the industry blamed the collapse of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad on a decade-long ICC review. 

   But the process is still costly and exhaustive. 
Before the commission made its initial ruling in the Santa Fe/Southern Pacific case, it heard testimony from 130 witnesses, reviewed 600 exhibits and read more than 18,000 pages of transcripts. 

   Despite uncountable hours of preparation, the two railroads turned out to be their own worst enemies. 
A Santa Fe witness testified that the merger wouldn't reduce competition because the two railroads -- both of which operate primarily in the West -- don't overlap much in the types of cargo that they carry. 
But the same witness later tried to make the point that other railroads that carted even one ton of any type of cargo would constitute a competitive threat to the combined Santa Fe/ Southern Pacific. 

   At another point, Santa Fe's lawyers argued that competition from trucks would mitigate the effects of the merger. 
But the company's chief witness on the subject testified that trucks can't carry many bulk commodities as cheaply and efficiently as railroads. 

   The most apparent inconsistencies had to do with Santa Fe's estimates of the financial strength of the Southern Pacific. 
First, the Southern Pacific filed affidavits saying that it would be viable for years to come. 
Later, Mr. Schmidt said that the Southern Pacific was close to bankruptcy. 
Investment bankers for the railroads variously estimated the worth of the Southern Pacific at $800 million and at a negative $200 million. 

   At one point, a flood of mail began to pour into the commission from rail customers who said they supported the merger. 
But ICC staff members noticed that each letter misspelled the name of the ICC's executive secretary, Noreta R. McGee. 
Instead of impressing the ICC, the campaign helped lead to an inquiry into whether the railroads were unduly pressuring customers to support the merger. 

   The smoking gun, however, turned out to be a confidential report from Mr. Schmidt to the board about the pricing advantages of the merger. 
The memo said that the combination would help the railroads achieve "pricing freedom" and that one of the goals was a rail monopoly in California and the Southwest. 
Although Santa Fe succeeded in persuading the commission to keep the report under seal, the ICC later referred to the memo as a "candid appraisal . . . unlike expert testimony and legal argument" of the true view of the Santa Fe railroad's management. 

   Last July, following a mere 17-minute discussion, the commission voted 4-1 to reject the merger as anti-competitive. 
The decision was unexpected, and it stunned the industry. 
Santa Fe had to cancel a luncheon with securities analysts scheduled for that day on the benefits of a favorable ICC ruling. 

   Few, however, were more surprised than Mr. Schmidt. 
Calling the decision a "horrible mistake," he vowed a grassroots campaign to overturn it and ordered the company's lawyers to petition the ICC to reopen the case. 

   Privately, though, some Santa Fe board members were already blaming Mr. Schmidt for the commission's decision. 
In addition to the memo, some faulted him for being undiplomatic throughout the process. 
Indeed, afraid that the ICC might yield to demands for changes, Mr. Schmidt had taken a tough, take-it-or-leave-it stance throughout the process. 

   The strategy seemed particularly ill-chosen later when, in an effort to get the merger reconsidered, Mr. Schmidt himself began offering concessions. 
One that particularly upset Southern Pacific employees was a proposal to lease what some believed was the soul of the railroad: the line between Sacramento, Calif., and Ogden, Utah, which dates back to 1869. 

   Mr. Schmidt's concessions, which eventually covered thousands of miles of track, "gave away more than we would have liked," says Robert West, a Santa Fe director. 
After all the changes, it "wasn't the same merger it was and didn't have the same benefits," says Lester Kloss, a senior vice president of A.T. Kearney Inc., a consultant for both railroads. 

   The concessions brought other problems as well. 
While they helped Mr. Schmidt persuade the Union Pacific to support the merger, they angered the Burlington Northern, which switched from a neutral position to opposing the merger. 
Mr. Schmidt declined repeated requests from this newspaper for an interview on his role. 

   Opposition from competitors also contributed to the initial rejection of the merger, and that has angered Santa Fe executives. 
"What irritates me," says Mr. Reed, "is that we didn't oppose the Burlington Northern mergers. 
We were gentlemen about it. 
But now that they've got theirs, they don't want anyone else to have similar capabilities." 

   The deterioration of the railroads -- particularly the Southern Pacific - during this limbo period has led to a decline in employee morale. 
Engines have even been allowed to run out of fuel in mid-trip. 
"To a person, our employees are sick to death of the process. 
Sick of decisions not being made or being made in a convoluted fashion. 
Sick to death of this merger," says a mid-level manager at the Southern Pacific. 

   Competitors have been able to lure away business by exploiting the low morale and Mr. Schmidt's talk of a Southern Pacific bankruptcy -- "an unfortunate choice of words on his part," says Edward Ahern, Southern Pacific's vice president of administration. 
Overall, Union Pacific has benefited the most, scoring a major coup when it won a big contract to haul finished automobiles for a joint venture of Toyota and General Motors in Fremont, Calif. 

   As the case has worn on, the distractions at both railroads have become overpowering. 
The merger "drove us nuts," says Lawrence Cena, who retired as the Santa Fe railroad's president about a year ago. 
Among other things, it contributed to the Santa Fe's tardy entry into doublestack container trains, which carry ocean containers one above the other. 

   On the Friday before Easter, according to current and former managers of the two railroads, a group of outside Santa Fe directors, led by Mr. Biaggini, the former Southern Pacific chairman, began plotting the ouster of Mr. Schmidt. 
Although the two men had once been allies, Mr. Biaggini was angered shortly after his retirement when Mr. Schmidt took away his use of the company jet and forced him to vacate a large office with a panoramic view of San Francisco Bay for an office one-quarter the size with a view of a courtyard. 

   At a hastily called meeting, the board sided with Mr. Biaggini. 
Mr. Schmidt was given a consultant's contract, reportedly worth $5 million, and an out-of-the-way office. 
His predecessor, Mr. Reed, agreed to come out of retirement to temporarily lead the company. 
Mr. Biaggini declines to discuss his role in the board's affairs. 

   Now, Mr. Reed finds himself confronting the company's biggest challenge ever. 
If the ICC rules against the merger, he will have to decide whether the parent company should remain in the railroad business at all. 
"The most frustrating part is that the two companies have been in suspense for so many years," he says. 

   At the company's recent annual meeting, Mr. Reed, 70, told the audience that he had never dreamed he would return to the corporation. 
"I'm just an old lantern swinger," he said at one point. 
But later, when asked whether he thought the merger would ever succeed, he paused and looked perplexed. 
"With the way things have gone so far," he said, "I guess you couldn't be surprised by anything that might happen."

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Soon after Philip Anschutz bought
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. in 1988, dozens of
employees gathered in the Utah desert to re-create railroad
history.
   As cameras clicked, the celebrants posed on facing diesel
locomotives from the Southern Pacific and from Mr. Anschutz's
smaller Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western. Recalling the 1869
"golden spike" ceremony on completion of the first
transcontinental railroad, the scene was meant to symbolize
Mr. Anschutz's plan to revive Southern Pacific as part of a
new railroad across the West.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Mr. Anschutz's Southern Pacific is hitting rough
track.
   Faced with deepening losses at the railroad and high debt
obligations, Mr. Anschutz is keeping the Southern Pacific
afloat with accelerated real estate sales. Shippers complain
of management confusion, erratic pricing tactics and delays
caused by worn-out locomotives.
   "A lot of people thought Anschutz coming aboard was like
Santa Claus coming down the chimney," says Rollin Bredenberg,
a Southern Pacific general manager. But combining the
railroad with Mr. Anschutz's smaller Denver &amp; Rio Grande
Western "hasn't solved any of the fundamental problems of the
Southern Pacific," he concedes.
   Others worry that Mr. Anschutz, a Denver owner of oil and
gas, real estate and Western art, doesn't know how to run a
railroad. Robert Starzel, a Southern Pacific vice chairman
and Anschutz confidant, says that railroading has proven
"difficult for us" but insists his boss will make the
railroad prosper.
   Although the Southern Pacific is the weakest of the
nation's seven major railroads and isn't publicly owned, its
health is of keen interest to shippers, consumers and
travelers. The railroad is the largest hauler of
international goods to the Midwest from Southern California
ports and its scenic routes are traversed by Amtrak passenger
trains.
   Mr. Anschutz and minority partner, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
acquired the company in a $1.02 billion leveraged buy-out
plus assumption of $780 million debt. The purchase was widely
hailed by Southern Pacific employees after a plan to merge
the railroad with Santa Fe Pacific Corp. was rejected by the
Interstate Commerce Commission in 1987.
   But hopes for fast rejuvenation of Southern Pacific have
faded. The company's rail operations had a loss of $66
million last year, reflecting a downturn in automobile and
lumber traffic, rate wars, a major accident and the cost of
adding new trains. Proceeds from property sales, however,
resulted in net income of $98 million.
   However, when real estate sales failed to cover the
company's burden of debt and capital spending, Southern
Pacific renegotiated terms of its loan with Bank of America
last December to avoid default. In April, Moody's Investors
Service downgraded $695 million of the company's long-term
debt, concluding that proceeds from real estate sales will
only partially offset the gap in cash from lower rail
operating earnings.
   The company's disappointing railroad performance has
shaken the confidence of some shippers. "I'm concerned that
they will become financially insolvent and the railroad will
be sold piecemeal," says Homer Bollard, general traffic
manager of Louisiana-Pacific Corp., a big lumber shipper.
   Southern Pacific officials dismiss such concerns. "This
isn't a question of bankruptcy. There are billions of dollars
of assets here," says Vice Chairman Starzel. Even if company
forecasts for profitable rail operations next year don't pan
out, Southern Pacific could support its railroad with
proceeds from real estate sales for years, Mr. Starzel says.
   Mr. Anschutz declines to give interviews. But he has told
shippers that his 15,000-mile rail franchise is among the
strongest, because it includes two major east-west routes and
track to most West and Gulf coast ports. To strengthen the
system, Mr. Anschutz bought a regional rail line last year,
giving Southern Pacific trains direct access to Chicago for
the first time. Now he is trying to overcome the objections
of competing railroads to buy a second route to Chicago.
Slight, restless and 50 years old, Mr. Anschutz likes to take
freight trains to meet crew members and entertain shippers
aboard the Anschutz family yacht.
   The Southern Pacific is struggling to regain ground lost
to competitors when it was held in trust for five years
pending its aborted merger with Santa Fe. While Southern
Pacific languished, larger rivals Union Pacific Corp. and
Burlington Northern Inc. moved aggressively to shed surplus
lines and employees and invest in modern technology.
   Without the heavy coal and grain traffic of Union Pacific
and Burlington Northern, the railroad is also highly
dependent upon cyclical and rate competitive shipments of
lumber, automobiles, chemicals and containerized freight.
   Mr. Anschutz also inherited the results of years of
lagging capital spending. Although Southern Pacific's main
lines have been upgraded, some of its yards are old and
poorly maintained. As he walks through Southern Pacific's
freight yard in Portland, Ore., trainmaster Robert Melbo is
summoned by radio to a two-car derailment caused by rotted
ties under the rails.
   Much of the company's locomotive fleet is old and
outmoded. And its freight cars for carrying lumber are
deplorable, says Dennis Williams, director of traffic and
distribution at Bohemia Inc., Eugene, Ore. "They have some
good cars but too few. The rest are old and inefficient."
   But some problems are of Mr. Anschutz's own making. He
built the railroad's management team with a president from
the Southern Pacific and a vice chairman from Denver &amp; Rio
Grande, even though the two railroads have conflicting
philosophies. While President D. Michael Mohan was steeped in
the Southern Pacific's costcutting ways, Vice Chairman
William Holtman learned at Denver &amp; Rio Grande to put a
premium on service. Southern Pacific executives say the
confusion is heightened because Mr. Holtman sometimes differs
with Mr. Mohan on important decisions.
   Last year Mr. Mohan tried to cut crew costs by ordering
that freight trains be combined. But after freight began to
back up in yards and customers complained of delayed
shipments, Mr. Holtman shortened train sizes. "We adopt a
strategy, and before it can produce results, we drop it and
try something else," says Mr. Melbo, the trainmaster, adding
that the company has changed its train-size requirements four
times in the past 18 months.
   Southern Pacific has won some freight lost to competitors
but often at such low rates that the railroad lost money
hauling the traffic. "In our zeal to sign up customers we
lost sight of the fact that you sign them up to make money,
not just to lure them away from someone else," says a former
Southern Pacific vice president.
   Now, the railroad's efforts to boost rates are straining
relationships with customers. "They had tremendous reductions
in rates to gain market share and then raised rates beyond
what the market will bear," says Philip Yeager, chairman of
Hub Group, a Chicago-based shippers' agent. "They have
bewildered the shipping public."
   Company officials say Mr. Anschutz sought to clear up
management confusion last fall by declaring Mr. Holtman head
of the railroad's day-to-day operations while putting Mr.
Mohan in charge of marketing and long-range strategy. Last
month Mr. Anschutz hired Don Orris, a former American
President Cos. executive who is highly regarded by shippers,
to give new direction to Southern Pacific's troubled
marketing and sales department.
   Some shippers see signs of improvements. American
President, a big container shipper, recently dropped threats
to abandon the Southern Pacific after the railroad boosted
on-time delivery of its shipments to 90% from 60%.
   Mr. Anschutz has won praise from rail labor. Glynn
Gallagher, a general chairman of the United Transportation
Union, says Mr. Anschutz improved relations between
management and labor by retiring a vice president who was
unpopular because of his harsh disciplinary tactics. "We're a
lot better off with Anschutz than we would have been any
other way," says Mr. Gallagher, who is supporting a plan to
sharply reduce crew sizes aboard Southern Pacific freight
trains in the West.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Anschutz tries to accelerate sales of real
estate that company officials value at close to $2 billion.
The company stunned long-time employees last month by
announcing that the company's San Francisco headquarters
building may be offered for sale. Southern Pacific is also
trying to peddle surplus lines in Los Angeles and San
Francisco to the state for rail transit corridors. When state
officials had trouble meeting the company's price for the
lines, Southern Pacific contributed $250,000 to an
environmental group that campaigned for new sources of
transit funding. Californians voted on and passed measures
Tuesday, which will provide $1.9 billion for state rail
projects.
   "Voters have said not only that they want these rail
corridors but that they are willing to pay for them and that
can mean a lot of money for us," Mr. Starzel said.

<HL> Santa Fe Southern Clears One Hurdle
In 3-Year Bid to Merge Railroad Units

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s three-year struggle to merge the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads cleared one hurdle, but another may have surfaced. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific said it and Union Pacific Corp., another railroad concern, agreed on a plan to clear up regulatory concerns that doomed the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific lines last summer. 
But at the same time, Union Pacific voiced new objections to a similar agreement between Santa Fe Southern Pacific and another competitor. 
Those concerns could further tangle the merger effort. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific was formed in 1983 by the combination of Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Corp. 
The two companies' energy and other operations were immediately merged, but their railroad units have been kept apart pending Interstate Commerce Commission approval. 

   As previously reported, the ICC unexpectedly quashed the merger in July because of worries that the combination would stifle competition across the Southwest. 
The rejection, the first time the ICC had killed a railroad merger in 20 years, stunned the industry and led many industry officials to fear that the era of consolidation that began two decades ago -- the only thing that has kept many railroad concerns alive -- has ended. 

   Union Pacific originally argued against the merger, which would have created the nation's third-largest rail system. 
The new agreement, which will be submitted to the ICC as part of a petition to reopen merger hearings, would give Union Pacific the right to run its trains over some Santa Fe and Southern Pacific lines in Texas, Illinois and other areas. 
It would also give Union Pacific certain pricing authority and other rights. 

   However, a Union Pacific official said that Union Pacific has "serious problems" with a similar agreement forged between Santa Fe Southern Pacific and Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co., another competitor that originally opposed the merger. 
In September, Santa Fe Southern Pacific agreed to give Denver &amp; Rio Grande access to markets west of Ogden, Utah. 
In return, Denver &amp; Rio Grande said it would drop its opposition to the combination. 

   But the agreement allows Denver &amp; Rio Grande to operate in central California for the first time. 
Union Pacific, which has operations in that area, has "problems with that, and that's something we'll have to have addressed" if the ICC takes up the merger again, the Union Pacific official said. 

   A Santa Fe Southern Pacific spokesman said he "wouldn't want to characterize" Union Pacific's stance. 
He said Santa Fe Southern Pacific intends to go through with its agreement with Denver &amp; Rio Grande. 
"We recognize that not everybody will always be satisfied with these things," he said. 
"That's often the case where the ICC is concerned." 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific has been expected to formally ask the ICC to reconsider the merger for months. 
The spokesman said the company will submit its appeal to have the merger talks reopened within the next few days. 
It has until Dec. 9 to file the petition, he said.

<HL> Santa Fe to Sell Southern Pacific to Unit
Of Anschutz; Move Likely to Be Opposed

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. agreed to sell its Southern Pacific railroad unit to Rio Grande Industries Inc. for $1.02 billion, but the proposal is likely to be vigorously contested in regulatory proceedings that could last a year or longer. 

   Two unsuccessful bidders -- Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. and the Railway Labor Executives' Association, which represents Southern Pacific employees -- said they oppose the proposed sale and will continue to pursue their bids. 
"The process has just begun," said Richard I. Kilroy, chairman of the railway association. 

   The proposed sale also drew criticism from Henley Group Inc., a La Jolla, Calif.-based company that holds a 14.7% stake in Sante Fe. 
Henley, which has hinted that it is considering a proxy battle or tender offer for Santa Fe, called the proposal "unwise," saying it "amounts to a bankruptcy auction." 

   Santa Fe decided to sell Southern Pacific after the Interstate Commerce Commission, citing anti-competitive concerns, ordered the Chicago-based company to shed one of the two railroad units that it has operated since 1983. 
But ICC approval also will be needed for the sale to Rio Grande, a railroad unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp. 

   Malcolm Sterrett, one of five ICC commissioners, said the agency hopes to make a decision about the proposed sale "as soon as possible." 
He added, however, that the process could take a year or longer. 

   Santa Fe said proceeds from the proposed sale would be used in connection with a plan to pay Santa Fe shareholders at least $4 billion in a previously announced restructuring of the railroad and energy concern. 
That plan, which involves additional borrowings, is seen partly as an effort to leverage Santa Fe to make it less attractive to unwanted suitors. 

   Santa Fe said Rio Grande agreed to pay $1.02 billion in cash for Southern Pacific and to assume about $780 million in outstanding debt. 
Robert D. Krebs, Santa Fe's chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement that the proposed sale "is consistent with the public interest and is in the best interest of our shareholders." 

   However, Kansas City Southern said its offer, which wasn't disclosed, was "hundreds of millions of dollars higher in value" and faced "fewer regulatory problems." 
A spokeswoman for the Kansas City, Mo.-based railroad pointed out that, when the ICC ordered Santa Fe to divest one of its railroad units, the agency commented that merging the Southern Pacific with the Rio Grande would result in "a loss of railroad competition in the West." 
An ICC official said that didn't necessarily mean the commission would reject the proposed sale. 

   Meanwhile, the railway employees association, which had offered to match any bid, maintained that its proposal was "the most viable in satisfying the ICC's divestiture order and the concerns of employees covered by existing agreements." 

   In San Francisco, Denman K. McNear, chairman of Southern Pacific, which has operated under a trust for the last four years, said that management is "disappointed" that its efforts with the railway employees association to buy the railroad "were not favorably considered." 

   Henley, which has interests in manufacturing, engineering and real estate, reiterated its contention that a sale or spinoff of Santa Fe's "healthy" Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe railroad "would create significant value for shareholders and give the ailing Southern Pacific a chance to recover." 

   Michael D. Dingman, Henley's chairman and chief executive officer, declined to say what action his company might take in response to the proposed sale of the Southern Pacific. 
The executive called the transaction "a travesty" and said that the proposed sale price is "way under its substantial value." 
However, Mr. Dingman added that "with a company as big as Santa Fe there's still a lot of value there" even without Southern Pacific. 

   Mr. Dingman also said that he expects the transaction "to create a turmoil at the ICC." 

   A spokesman for Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which holds an 8.2% stake in Santa Fe, said the Toronto-based real estate company didn't plan any immediate comment on the proposed sale. 

   Southern Pacific, formally known as the Southern Pacific Transportation Co., operates a 13,000-mile system stretching from Portland, Ore., to New Orleans with a route going from Texas to Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis. 
The Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad unit of Rio Grande Industries is a 2,500-mile system between Utah and Kansas City, Mo. 

   The combination would create one of the five largest rail systems in the U.S., a 15,500-mile system serving 14 states. 
Samuel R. Freeman, vice president and general counsel for Rio Grande, maintained that it would be "an end-to-end merger" that would "restore the competitive balance" in the central U.S.

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said it reached another agreement aimed at smoothing the way for the proposed merger of its two railway units, the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific. 

   Santa Fe Southern said it reached a binding agreement with the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co., allowing the Denver &amp; Rio Grande to retain access to markets west of Ogden, Utah. 
As previously reported, the rail lines reached a tentative accord on rail access last September. 

   John J. Schmidt, chairman of Santa Fe Southern Pacific, said, "This agreement and those previously announced with Union Pacific and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad have been designed to address adverse competitive impacts identified by the (Interstate Commerce Commission) relating to our proposed merger." 

   Last July, the ICC rejected the proposed merger, which would have formed the nation's third-largest rail system. 
The agency said the merger would be anti-competitive and cited opposition from several railroads, including the Denver &amp; Rio Grande. 

   The Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific have operated separately since their parents, Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Corp., combined in 1983 to form Santa Fe Southern Pacific. 

   A petition to reopen the merger case is pending before the ICC.

   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. was
trying to determine what its options are today after the Interstate
Commerce Commission approved the sale of the Southern Pacific
Railroad to Rio Grande Industries.
   Kansas City Southern, which had offered to buy the Southern
Pacific, could challenge the ICC ruling in court but the company's
president and chief executive officer, Landon Rowland, said no
decision has been made on what the next step, if any, would be.
   ``We're not ruling out anything,'' Rowland told reporters after
the ICC vote in Washington, D.C.
   Rio Grande Industries has agreed to buy the Southern Pacific
from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. for $1.2 billion. Kansas City
Southern has offered to buy Southern Pacific for $1.25 billion.
   But the ICC in a 4-0 vote said the merger of the Southern
Pacific and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western railroads would have
the best competitive results and be in the public interest.
   The commission last year ordered the Santa Fe Southern Pacific
Corp. to divest itself of the Southern Pacific after the rejection
of that railroad's merger with the Santa Fe.
   Santa Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries,
but when permission for the sale was sought from the ICC, Kansas
City Southern objected and sought to buy Southern Pacific as well.
   In a series of votes today, the ICC turned its back on the
Kansas City Southern proposal and approved the sale to Rio Grande
Industries instead.
   Meanwhile, a three-judge court is scheduled to meet Friday in
Kansas City to consider KCSI's application for a stay of a recent
order barring the company from completing its efforts to purchase
Southern Pacific, according to Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
Judge Pasco Bowman.
   Bowman told attorneys in Kansas City that when a South Dakota
judge Friday prohibited the company from buying Southern Pacific,
he also delayed the prohibition from taking effect until after it
could be appealed.
   Bowman's observation came after a short hearing Monday morning.
He said a temporary stay on the prohibition, preventing it from
taking effect, was to last until next Tuesday.
   A federal judge in Sioux Falls, S.D., last week blocked KCSI
from buying Southern Pacific Railroad. Judge John B. Jones said
Kansas City Southern could not buy Southern Pacific while it is
appealing a $600 million judgment the state of South Dakota has
against Kansas City Southern.
   The judge ruled for South Dakota officials, who argued that the
purchase might jeopardize the recovery of their judgment in the
anti-trust lawsuit.
   But Kansas City Southern officials say the purchase would
enhance the value of their company, rather than harm it.
   South Dakota won the judgment in a suit alleging Kansas City
Southern helped kill a $3.8 billion coal-slurry pipeline that would
have helped the state's economy. The state contended Kansas City
Southern worked against the project because it would have hurt the
railroad's business.
   The pipeline plan was dropped in 1984.

<HEAD>Anschutz Completes Southern Pacific Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire Philip Anschutz has completed a $1.8
billion acquisition of the Southern Pacific Railroad, one of the
nation's oldest rail lines with track stretching from Oregon to
Louisiana.
   The historic railroad, combined with his Denver &amp; Rio Grande
Railroad, puts Anschutz at the head of the nation's fifth-largest
rail company in terms of track mileage.
   The purchase ``ends years of uncertainty and opens the door to
robust competition in the western rail corridors,'' said Rio Grande
Chariman W. J. Holtman at the deal's closing in New York on
Thursday.
   ``This historic combination brings together two railroads which
hold an important place in the pioneering of the West,'' he noted.
   Anschutz's new railroad has 15,046 miles of track and is ranked
sixth nationally based on revenues estimated at $2.5 billion. The
Rocky Mountain News reported that he paid $1.02 billion in cash and
assumed $760 million in debt.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the combination in
August. Last year the ICC rejected a proposal that Chicago-based
Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. merge the Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe railroads and ordered the company to divest one of the
lines.
   The company chose to sell the Southern Pacific, but had to
overcome the objections of another rail company before it could
proceed. Southern Pacific's stock has been held in a trust for
nearly five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should
own the railroad.
   Anschutz, who made his fortune in oil, gas and real estate, will
become chairman of Southern Pacific.
   Mike Mohan, now executive vice president of Southern Pacific,
will become the chief executive of both lines, which will operate
from Southern Pacific's San Francisco headquarters. D&amp;RG had been
headquartered in Denver.
   Anschutz has said 400 to 800 jobs will be lost through the
consolidation of the two companies. The cuts likely will be split
evenly between San Francisco and Denver.
   The two lines will remain separate entities, although both will
be held by Rio Grande Industries Inc., said Anschutz's attorney,
Bob Starzel.
   D&amp;RG mainly carries coal on about 2,500 miles of track between
Kansas City, Mo., and Colorado and Utah and rents track to other
railroads. Three times a week runs the Rio Grande Zephyr from Salt
Lake City to Denver.
   ``This creates the only western railroad with two rail
corridors. ... Now, Southern Pacific and Rio Grande will be in both
the southern and central corridors,'' Starzel said.

FT  07 JUL 94 / US frontiers blurred after railway merger: Stock swap may
lead to east meeting west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A railway that makes a profit has become a rarity since road transport
started to offer a cheaper and more flexible alternative. But in the past
few years, US railways have been doing very nicely. Now two of them, the
Burlington Northern and the Santa Fe Pacific, plan to do even better by
merging their large networks in a Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) stock swap,
creating by far the biggest railway in the US: the Burlington Northern and
Santa Fe.
Unlike railways in most other countries, US railway companies - all of them
in the private sector - operate only freight trains. Passenger services are
operated over the private railways' tracks by the state-owned Amtrak, which
lost Dollars 730m last year.
Just 20 years ago, it was not too fanciful to imagine that US railways might
cease to exist. Federal government investment in the construction of an
interstate road system had encouraged rapid growth in the road haulage
industry, and the heavily regulated railways were unable to compete.
With many railways staring at bankruptcy, the industry went through a wave
of mergers in the late 1970s and early 1980s that cut the 17 big railway
companies to seven. Around the same time, the railways also began to see the
first glimmer of salvation with the passage of the Staggers Act in 1980,
which in effect deregulated the industry.
Once the merger mania was over, all the big railways started using their new
commercial freedom to set more competitive freight rates, drop unprofitable
traffic, dispose of loss-making lines and cut jobs. Gradually the red ink
turned to black.
While cost-cutting was the main theme of the 1980s, in the 1990s the
railways have started to win more traffic. Economic growth is one reason for
the increase; a shortage of drivers in the trucking industry has helped,
too. But more importantly, lower costs have enabled the railways to show
they are still capable of competing with road hauliers on price, at least on
long-distance trips.
One of their fastest-growing markets is for intermodal traffic - trailers
and containers that switch from road to rail for the long-distance part of
their journey.
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe say this is why they want to get together.
Although both railways lie to the west of the Mississippi, connecting the
Midwest with the Pacific coast, most of Burlington's network lies to the
north of Santa Fe's: so connecting the two would greatly increase the number
of long-distance destinations on offer to both railways' customers.
The merged railways would also get a substantial boost to competitiveness
because of the efficiency savings flowing from higher traffic densities and
reduced administrative costs.
The big question, however, is: will they get away with it? The Interstate
Commerce Commission, a federal regulatory agency, stood aside during the
wave of railway mergers in the 1970s and early 1980s. But in 1987 it
forcibly intervened in a deal between Santa Fe and another of the Big Seven
railways, Southern Pacific, telling them to unbundle a merger that had been
accomplished more than three years earlier.
Santa Fe hopes this deal will be different. The Santa Fe and Southern
networks, it says, were largely overlapping, and the Interstate Commerce
Commission had feared that a merger would reduce competition.
The Santa Fe and Burlington networks, by contrast, hardly overlap at all: it
would be an 'end-to-end' merger, increasing the options available to
customers and allowing the merged railways to compete more effectively with
Union Pacific, the biggest operator west of the Mississippi.
If the commission does allow the merger - and it could be the end of next
year before it reaches a decision - the result could be to encourage more
deals between US railways. But future mergers are likely to be different
from any seen before.
For years, the industry has speculated on the possibility that one of the
four big railways to the west of the Mississippi might merge with one of the
three big railways to the east - the Norfolk Southern, CSX and Conrail.
This would create a transcontinental railway network providing customers
with a seamless coast-to-coast freight transport service, without the costs
and delays associated with interchanging traffic from one operator to
another.
Analysts had speculated that any one merger would start a game of musical
chairs in which the other big railways would also scramble to form east-west
partnerships.
With four companies on one side of the Mississippi and three on the other,
it always looked as though one company west of the Mississippi would be left
in the cold.
A successful merger between Burlington and Santa Fe would send a signal to
the rest of the railway industry that end-to-end mergers were acceptable to
the commission, and conveniently even up the number of potential partners to
three on each side of the Mississippi. At that stage, the logic of a
transcontinental merger wave might become irresistible.

<HEAD>Rio Grande Files Application To Acquire Southern Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rio Grande Industries Inc. on Monday filed an
application with the Interstate Commerce Commission to acquire
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. for $1 billion from Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp.
   Rio Grande said in a news release that if the acquisition was
made, it planned to sell a 25 percent share in the merged railroads
to a limited partnership affiliated with the investment firm Morgan
Stanley Group Inc.
   The ICC already has approved an expedited schedule for the
application, with a final decision expected in six months, Rio
Grande said.
   The application follows a formal purchase agreement that Rio
Grande entered into with Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. Last year,
the ICC ordered Santa Fe Southern to divest either the Southern
Pacific or the Santa Fe Railroad.
   Rio Grande's action will affect Kansas City Southern Industries
Inc.'s rival bid of more than $1.25 billion for the Southern
Pacific, said Joele Frank of Adams &amp; Rinehart in New York, which
handles KCSI's public relations.
   ``Kansas City is planning to ask the ICC to choose which company
should acquire the Southern Pacific, based on which would serve the
public interest the best,'' she said. ``They will ask that the ICC
consider whether the bidder helps the competition, and also is
willing to pay a higher price.''
   Ms. Frank said KCSI should be aided in the ICC deliberations by
having the higher offer.
   Rio Grande officials equally were confident their proposal would
win ICC approval.
   ``We are confident that the commission will find this
single-line system covering both the southern and central rail
corridors will enhance competition for the benefit of shippers and
the public,'' said William Holtman, Rio Grande chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Tom Saunders, chairman of the equity fund, said: ``The financial
commitment we are making is the strongest statement possible about
our confidence in the long-term viability of this venture.''
   The two lines will be an end-to-end joining of railroads whose
common points at Ogden, Utah, Herrington, Kan., and Kansas City,
Mo., will allow complete connection of the two systems, Rio Grande
said.
   Rio Grande's proposal has been accompanied by a commitment to
honor existing labor contracts. The railroad also said it has
received the unanimous support of the general chairmen of all the
unions representing Southern Pacific workers.
   Roy Thiessen, vice president of marketing and sales for the
Denver and Rio Grande Western, said shippers have expressed support
for the merger as well.
   ``It is clear that the public and customers are anxious to see
this acquisition approved promptly, without delays caused by third
parties,'' said Thiessen.

   Rio Grande Industries said it intends to make a bid for Southern Pacific Transportation Co. in order to merge the carrier with its Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad unit. 

   Rio Grande, a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp., didn't specify a purchase price. 
Industry analysts have said Southern Pacific could sell for as much as $1 billion. 

   Rio Grande is the latest in a string of potential buyers to step forward since June, when the Interstate Commerce Commission rejected as anti-competitive the proposed merger of Southern Pacific and the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway. 

   The ICC ordered the railroads' parent company, Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., to spin off one of the carriers. 

   Since then, Southern Pacific's employee unions, its managers and Kansas Southern Industries Inc., another railroad concern, have said they are planning bids. 
So far, none have made specific proposals. 

   Rio Grande earlier discussed buying a portion of San Francisco-based Southern Pacific. 

   Santa Fe officials declined to comment on any of the potential bidders. 
However, a spokesman said the company expects to comply with the ICC's order by the end of the year. 

   A Rio Grande-Southern Pacific merger would combine two of the oldest railroads in the West. 
Southern Pacific extends 13,000 miles from Southern California across the South and Midwest to Memphis, Tenn. 
Rio Grande stretches 2,400 miles across the Rocky Mountains. 

   Any bid from Rio Grande would require ICC approval. 
A company spokesman said the railroad doesn't anticipate regulatory problems since "nowhere do the tracks of these two railroads run parallel."

   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.
says it has asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to authorize
KCSI, and not the Denver Rio Grande Western Railway, to acquire and
operate the Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
   The application was based on the belief that it would be in the
best public interest for KCSI to own Southern Pacific, said Landon
Rowland, president and chief executive officer of KCSI, on Monday.
   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation has been required by the
ICC to divest the Southern Pacific because a merger between it and
the Santa Fe Railway would have essentially ended railroad
competition in the Southwest and other markets served by the two
railroads, Rowland said.
   ``Santa Fe Southern Pacific chose to sell the Southern Pacific
to Denver Rio Grande, rather than to Kansas City Southern, for what
we believe to be purely anti-competitive reasons,'' he said.
   KCSI's operating plan, filed Monday with the ICC, calls for the
purchase of 547 modern locomotives over the next five years.
   ``In contrast, the Philip F. Anschutz interests, which control
the Denver Rio Grande, appear to treat the acquisition as primarily
a real estate play, and propose to buy only 40 new locomotives over
essentially the same period,'' he said.
   Samuel R. Freeman, the Rio Grande's vice president and general
counsel, said his company wouldn't neglect the Southern Pacific. It
would lease most new equipment instead of buying it to capitalize
on financial and tax benefits, Freeman said.
   The Rio Grande runs across about 1,900 miles, from Kansas City
to Utah. It hasn't revealed details for combining its small local
work force with that of the Southern Pacific, which has about 280
employees.
   Monday was the deadline for comments about the Southern
Pacific's proposed sale to be filed with regulators.
   Also opposing the deal were Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft and the
Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission.
   Freeman said the Rio Grande's purchase was backed by most
shippers, regulators and other railroads.
   The ICC expects to rule in mid-August on the sale plan.
   Regulators last June killed Santa Fe Southern Pacific's efforts
to merge the Southern Pacific with the Rio Grande Railway, which it
also owns. They feared that a merger of the two big lines, whose
tracks overlap in many areas, would stifle competition and increase
shipping rates.
   Early last year Kansas City Southern began a furious campaign to
buy the Southern Pacific. But the lobbying didn't prevent Santa Fe
Southern Pacific from naming the Rio Grande as the railroad's buyer
in late December.

   When John J. Schmidt in 1983 undertook to merge his Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway with the Southern Pacific Railroad he felt the two lines had a "manifest destiny" to become one. 
That's an old-fashioned expression applied to two railroads with a long and colorful history. 
The one laid track along the Santa Fe trail in Civil War days and the other, SP, was a key player in the post-Gold Rush development of California. 

   But alas, the Interstate Commerce Commission had other ideas. 
Overruling both the staff and chairman, four members of the commission voted last July 24 to deny the merger. 
They had been convinced by the Justice Department and other intervenors that the merger would be "anticompetitive." 
So Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. (SFSP), the already merged holding company, was forced to put Southern Pacific Railroad in trust and attempt to meet the ICC objections. 

   SFSP has since exchanged trackage rights with four competitors, most particularly the big Union Pacific. 
Now Mr. Schmidt, SFSP chairman and chief executive, is asking the ICC to reconsider. 

   "We're responding to what they found was necessary. 
To get the decision early is just vital. 
We've had the employees of both railroads hanging in limbo for over three and a half years; it's demoralizing to employees. 
If we have to unravel, there's going to be further dislocation of what the railroad structure is going to be like in the country and there'll be a fairly extended period of unsettled conditions. 
We thought we were pursuing what I call the manifest destiny of not only both railroads but of the merger scheme as conceived of under the National Transportation Policy. 

   "If we misconceived, what's going to happen and whom we sell one or both railroads to and how it will affect the national transportation system is a chapter that is unwritten yet. 
We know what our options are and they will be pursued, but we very, very much want this merger and we think it's good for enhancing rail competition among more viable competitors." 

   If the ICC's rejection came as a big surprise to Mr. Schmidt, he can perhaps be forgiven. 
When you look at a map of the U.S. rail system there is indeed a certain tidiness to the idea of having six major rail systems, three in the East and three in the West. 
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Railway Co. (SPSF), the name planned for the railroad component of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., would represent the southern tier in the West. 
The Union Pacific would be the middle tier and the Burlington Northern the top tier. 
In the East the three main systems would be newly privatized Conrail, CSX and Norfolk Southern. 

   Years ago, there were hopes for a group of transcontinental railroads. 
But the main thrust since the rails were deregulated has been to try to revive the badly rundown system through cost cutting. 
And that is most quickly done by merging lines with parallel trackage and spinning off unprofitable branch lines to newly formed, and largely nonunion, short line companies. 

   Of course, that was exactly what the ICC ruled against in the SPSF case, which is why its decision was such a big surprise. 
Up until then, Washington had come a long way in enlightening itself on the costs of economic regulation. 
Indeed, the main reason the deregulatory Staggers Act passed in 1980 was that the railroads were in such sad shape. 
Federal Railway Administrator John Riley notes that at that time roads accounting for one-quarter of the national trackage were in bankruptcy, 48,000 miles of track were under "slow orders," meaning they weren't safe for normal speeds, and the roads were losing 20 million tons of volume a year. 
Since deregulation, the railroads have made a comeback, but earnings are by no means spectacular. 

   The ICC's SPSF ruling helped fan fears of a reactionary re-regulatory movement, but those fears now have diminished some. 
The economic cost would be huge. 

   It's instructive to note that the original SPSF application envisioned savings to the public and the railroads themselves of nearly $288 million a year. 
Mr. Schmidt now estimates he has given up $39 million to other carriers in trackage deals. 
But the total savings now would be $294 million. 
For example, SPSF would be able to use Union Pacific trackage from St. Louis to Chicago, saving itself a backhaul of 250 miles through Kansas City. 
That means "a lot, a lot of money." 

   But what about competition? 
The justification of regulation was that railroading was a "natural monopoly." 
That concept still gets much exercise in ICC hearings and congressional debates. 
It doesn't take a genius to see that trucks are a big competitor for railroads. 
Yet the ICC majority last year refused to consider trucks and based its decision solely on whether the SPSF merger would diminish rail-to-rail competition. 
There was an esoteric debate over whether trucks are competitive on hauls of over 1,000 miles, an issue Chairman Heather J. Gradison obviously found puzzling since the SPSF hauls a lot of freight less than 1,000 miles just as trucks do. 

   In fact, given the highly developed U.S. transportation infrastructure, few if any shippers are truly "captive" to rails. 
The best case is made by electric utilities that have power plants served by coal-hauling roads, but big utilities don't lack bargaining power. 
For one thing, the Staggers Act now allows long-term contracts between shippers and railroads. 
That, incredibly, was not allowed under the old law because Congress had once decided that volume discounts to big shippers were "unfair." 
In drawing up contracts, the relevant fact is that both the railroad and the utility need each other. 
Some utilities, particularly in the West, have surplus capacity, meaning they can switch to other sources if hauling costs at a single plant rise. 

   "I would love to get the same return on carrying coals to Newcastle that Newcastle gets, Newcastle being the utilities," says Mr. Schmidt. 
Utilities have a much higher return on capital than railroads, he says. 

   There also is broader competition. 
"If you don't move the traffic you don't get any money and if the guy you move it for doesn't make any money, you're not going to move it for long," Mr. Schmidt observes, quite plausibly. 
If the customer has competition, which he usually has, the railroad has competition, too. 

   Railroads have their own hang-ups, Mr. Schmidt says. 
"Rail attitudes have been terrible in the past because it was all regulation. 
You go to the commission and say my costs have gone up, and gee, the labor boys won again and you raise the rate and you raise the rate and you raise the rate and what is happening is that most of the traffic that had an option is going, going, gone to trucks and the pipelines. 
And then the people that couldn't go anywhere, they were trapped. 
Staggers came along to stop that ball game." 

   Clearly, things have been looking up in railroading and the transportation business in general. 
The trains are getting up to speed again. 
Systems are being rationalized and the competition is fierce among all modes of transportation, which can only mean very large savings for the public. 
Another turndown of the SPSF merger, which seems unlikely given the support it now has picked up from shippers and even competing roads, would be a disturbing reversal. 
But stranger things have happened in the wonderful world of transportation regulation.

   Burlington Northern Inc., which this week announced a new
rail-barge service, will be challenging a trio of railroad
rivals for the fast growing trade between the U.S. and
Mexico.
   The Fort Worth, Texas, railroad company operates the
longest rail system in the U.S., but it must rely on the
rails of competing carriers to reach the Mexican market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new service is designed to challenge Union Pacific
Corp., Rio Grande Industries' Southern Pacific Transportation
Co., and Santa Fe Pacific Corp. for the half-billion-dollar
rail market, which is estimated to be growing 10% a year. An
anticipated free-trade agreement between the U.S. and Mexico
is expected to further accelerate the market growth.
   "Burlington Northern is the only one of the big Western
railroads that doesn't have a direct track connection to
Mexico," says William J. Rennicke, a vice president of
Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane, a transportation consulting firm in
Lexington, Mass. The rail-barge service planned by Burlington
Northern is "a very creative way to extend its rail network
and service into a growing market and bypass its three
Western rail competitors."
   Burlington Northern said yesterday that it and Grupo
Protexa S.A., Monterrey, Mexico, are equal partners in a
joint venture that will provide the rail-barge service by
mid-1992. The service, the first of its kind between the two
countries, will allow Burlington Northern freight cars to
roll onto Protexa rail barges at Texas Gulf ports. The barges
will link with the Mexican rail network at the east coast
ports of Altamira, Veracruz and Coatzacoalcos.
   The joint venture, Protexa Burlington International S.A.,
to be based in Mexico City, will represent a "substantial
pooling of assets," Burlington Northern said. The joint
venture will include rail cars, locomotives, tugboats and
barges equipped with rails for carrying freight cars.
   Burlington Northern officials declined to estimate
investment and revenues. But Anthony Hatch, an analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. in New York, said he expects the rail-barge
service to eventually generate revenues of about $100 million
a year.
   In announcing the new rail-barge service, Burlington
Northern said it hoped to alleviate the "ever-present, and
increasing, border and port congestion in Mexico."
   The company said the new service will initially haul grain
cars from the U.S. to Mexico but would be expanded to
transport products from raw materials to finished goods.
   Executives at railroads with direct track connections to
Mexico played down the competitive threat from the planned
rail-barge service. Rollin D. Bredenberg, vice
president-Mexico of Southern Pacific Transportation, said the
new service would allow Burlington Northern to increase its
market share at the expense of grain presently going by water
to the east coast of Mexico.
   "I think Burlington Northern will still access the
northern and western markets of Mexico using Southern
Pacific's gateway connections to Mexico," said Mr.
Bredenberg. "The rail-barge {service} will allow Burlington
Northern to compete with water transportation of grain to
points in central and southern Mexico."
   A spokesman for Union Pacific's rail unit, responding to
the Burlington Northern comment about border congestion, said
it has eliminated congestion problems at its Laredo, Texas,
gateway to Mexico. The company said changes in its train
operations and customs procedures have opened the flow of its
rail traffic across the border. In addition, Union Pacific is
currently leasing 30 locomotives to Ferrocarriles Nacionales
de Mexico to meet increasing demands for rail transportation
between the U.S. and Mexico.

Rio Grande Industries confirmed Friday that it is trying to buy 500 miles of 
railroad between Kansas City and Chicago from Soo Line Corp of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The track would give Rio Grande, parent of the Southern Pacific and Denver 
&amp; Rio Grande Western railroads, its first direct link to Chicago from the 
West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the railroad must hand off goods to other lines, including Soo, in 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Grande said it is optimistic it will be able to reach an agreement with Soo 
for the Kansas City-Chicago line, which passes through Missouri, Iowa and 
northern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"No final agreement has been reached," the railroad said in a statement, "but 
negotiations are progressing and a number of significant issues have been 
resolved in principle." 
</P>
<P>
The railroad's actions indicate that Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz intends 
to act quickly to bolster his privately held rail operation. In October, his 
Rio Grande Industries bought the Southern Pacific from Santa Fe Southern 
Pacific Corp. for $1 billion.

<HL> ICC Urged to Block Sale of Santa Fe's Southern Pacific </HL>

<TEXT>
   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. and a union representing employees of Southern Pacific Transportation Co. asked the Interstate Commerce Commission Monday to block the sale of the Southern Pacific to Rio Grande Industries Inc. 

   Kansas City Southern's bid for the Southern Pacific was rejected by the railroad's parent, Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., last year. 
Kansas City Southern is hoping its offer will get a second airing, this time in the governmental arena. 
All rail mergers must be approved by the ICC. 

   The employee group, meanwhile, asked the commission to reject Rio Grande's merger application and support a bid by the Southern Pacific employees. 
The group represents members of an employee stock ownership plan who hold about a 1% stake in San Francisco-based Southern Pacific. 

   Santa Fe agreed to sell the Southern Pacific to Rio Grande, a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp., for $1.02 billion in cash last December. 
Rio Grande also agreed to assume $780 million in Southern Pacific debt. 

   Although the other bidders never disclosed the amounts of their offers, Kansas City Southern reportedly offered a price close to Rio Grande's, but in cash and notes. 
The employees' bid was around $900 million, an official familar with the offers said. 

   Originally, Santa Fe intended to merge the Southern Pacific with its Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway unit. 
But the ICC denied the merger on anti-competitive grounds last June and ordered the company to divest itself of one of the railroad units. 

   Monday was the deadline for filing objections to the proposed sale. 

   Rio Grande's application received a boost Friday when the Justice Department, in an opinion filed with the ICC, said it saw no reason for the agency to disapprove the sale. 

   Rejecting Kansas City Southern's arguments, the Justice Department said it would be "unnecessary and burdensome" for the ICC to choose between two buyers who each meet the divestiture criteria. 
"The choice should be up to Santa Fe," the department said. 

   The Kansas City Southern's chances were further imperiled when a South Dakota federal jury recently ordered the company to pay the state between $243 million and $611 million for antitrust and contract-interference violations related to a coal-slurry pipeline project there. 
Kansas City Southern has asked the court to set aside the verdict and to order a new trial.

FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Two US rail groups plan to merge
in Dollars 2.8bn deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the biggest railroads in the US, the Burlington Northern and the
Santa Fe Pacific, yesterday announced that they planned to merge in a deal
worth Dollars 2.8bn.
If allowed, the merger will create by far the biggest railroad in the US,
joining two complementary networks spreading from the west coast to the
midwest. It will be called the Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
However, the deal faces an investigation by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, a federal regulatory body which seven years ago ordered the
unbundling of a merger between Santa Fe and Southern Pacific, another
railroad in the same region, on the grounds that it was anti-competitive.
The proposed deal will take the form of a takeover of Sante Fe Pacific by
Burlington Northern, the bigger of the two companies. Santa Fe shareholders
will receive 0.27 of a Burlington share for each Santa Fe share they hold,
putting a value of Dollars 2.8bn on Santa Fe.
In other respects, the deal looks like a true merger of two healthy and
profitable companies. Burlington made net profits of Dollars 296m on
turnover of Dollars 4.7bn last year, while Santa Fe made net profits of
Dollars 338m on turnover of Dollars 2.7bn.
Although passenger trains in the US are operated by the state-owned Amtrak,
all the country's track infrastructure and freight trains are owned and
operated by private sector railroad companies.
Recently the freight railroads have enjoyed a surge in profitability caused
by a combination of growth in the US economy, big increases in efficiency
and productivity, and a lack of capacity in the road haulage industry
resulting from driver shortages.
West of the Mississippi, Burlington and Santa Fe are two of four big
railroads. The others are Southern and Union Pacific.
Burlington and Santa Fe said the proposed merger was not anti-competitive
because their networks were complementary rather than competing, connecting
with one another at the ends of their routes. The combined railroad would
compete mainly with Union Pacific.
The two companies said the merger would result in substantial cost savings
though operational improvements, higher traffic densities and reduced
administrative costs.
Customers would benefit from being able to use a single railroad to reach a
wider range of destinations, eliminating the costs and delays associated
with interchanges.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission today
postponed a decision on whether to approve a $110 million merger
that would make the regional Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co. a
part of the giant Union Pacific Corp.
   ICC Chairman Heather J. Gradison canceled a scheduled vote,
saying that Commissioner J.J. Simmons III had failed to give his
fellow commission members adequate time to review his proposed
conditions for the merger.
   Under agency rules, commissioners must distribute any amendments
the day before a planned vote. Simmons did not outline his
proposals at today's brief session and, under commission rules,
amendments are not made public until they are discussed at a
meeting.
   No new meeting to consider the merger was scheduled immediately,
and Al Brown, an ICC spokesman, said it was unlikely that another
vote will be set before next week.
   The railroads contend that consolidating operations would
provide improved service at lower costs and ensure reliable
long-term transportation, especially for Midwestern grain shippers
relying on the 3,100-mile MKT system known as the ``Katy.''
   Other railroads have questioned whether the proposed merger will
reduce competition, because the Katy's lines generally parallel
some Union Pacific routes from Kansas and Missouri to southern
Texas and the Gulf Coast. The Union Pacific is a 21,500-mile
network formed by a rail merger six years ago.
   To address those concerns, Union Pacific has offered competing
railroads the rights to use some trackage on proposed merger routes.
   Without the merger, the ICC has been told, the financially
ailing Katy could face problems surviving against bigger
competitors. Operating income for the Katy declined from $37
million in 1981 to $5 million in 1986.
   The Union Pacific, the nation's third largest railroad system in
terms of track mileage, serves about 20 states with routes from Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle in the West to Chicago and New
Orleans. The company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the
Union Pacific, Missouri Pacific and Western Pacific railroads.
   The Katy serves six states, with mostly north-south routes
running from Omaha to the Gulf Coast in Texas. A separate east-west
route extends between Kansas City and St. Louis.
   Union Pacific, which filed an application in November 1986
seeking government approval of the Katy acquisition, says the
merger would produce operating savings of $61 million a year.
Company officials say grain shippers would benefit through a
shorter, more direct single-line route to export markets in Texas
Gulf ports.
   However, the merger would eliminate about 1,100 Katy jobs
because of closings of rail yards and repair shops. Union Pacific
also plans to abandon 405 miles of track, mostly operated by Katy,
if the merger is approved.
   Union Pacific has taken steps to ease objections to the merger.
For example, the company has agreed to pay $1 million to the
southeast Kansas community of Parson in exchange for not opposing
the merger. The city would lose about 300 Katy jobs, with an
estimated $8 million payroll, under the merger.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission said it wouldn't decide whether to reconsider its rejection of the proposed merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads until March 2. 

   The commission said that reopening the case "may well be appropriate," but that it needed additional data from the railroads. 
In particular, it requested information on the steps the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific are taking to lessen anti-competitive problems posed by the merger. 
The commission raised questions of competition last July in rejecting the merger -- a move that stunned the railroad industry. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., the Chicago-based holding company that owns the Santa Fe and holds the Southern Pacific in trust, has reached agreements with a number of other railroads in an effort to win support for the proposed merger. 
For example, it agreed to give Union Pacific Corp. and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad rights to operate on some of the units' lines. 

   But the commission said it hasn't received sufficient information on the settlements, and warned: "We won't reopen on the basis of speculation that ongoing negotiations might produce an acceptable solution sometime in the future. 
The petition to reopen will be granted only if applicants can show in sufficient detail what their proposal is." 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. was created in December 1983, when Santa Fe Industries Inc. merged with Southern Pacific Co. in a $6.4 billion transaction. 
While the energy, natural resources and construction operations of the two companies were immediately combined, the two railroads were kept separate pending ICC approval.

   Kansas City Southern Railway Co. said it asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to uphold the rejection of the proposed merger between the Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe railroads. 

   In its petition, Kansas City Southern, a unit of Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., said it would make a bid to buy Southern Pacific Railroad within 60 days if the commission doesn't overturn itself. 
Kansas City Southern said it has retained Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to advise it on a bid for the railroad, but offered no details about any possible proposal. 

   Meanwhile, two government agencies voiced their opinions again on the merger. 
The Department of Transportation, which previously supported the merger, sent a letter to the commission yesterday reaffirming that support. 
The Justice Department, which has previously opposed the merger, reasserted its opposition. 

   The commission jolted the railroad industry last July by blocking the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific on the grounds that it would be anti-competitive. 
The merger, which was opposed by several railroads, including the Kansas City Southern, would create the nation's third-largest rail system. 

   Since July, Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., the parent of the railroad combination, has satisfied most of the opponents of the merger by offering traffic and pricing concessions. 
In December, Santa Fe Southern appealed the commission's ruling. 
Railroad industry experts said they expect a commission decision on the Santa Fe Southern Pacific appeal soon. 

   If the appeal is rejected, Santa Fe Southern Pacific would have to divest itself of one of the railroads under a time schedule and in a manner approved by the commission. 
In filings last year with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Santa Fe Southern Pacific said the Southern Pacific had net assets of $2.31 billion and 1985 revenue of $2.55 billion. 
For the first nine months of 1986, the railroad had revenue of $1.78 billion. 

   In an interview, Landon H. Rowland, Kansas City Southern's president and chief executive officer, said his company would bid for the Southern Pacific once the merger question is cleared up by the commission. 
He declined to say how much Kansas City Southern was prepared to bid for the railroad. 
"From our data and our familiarity with that system, we think the property, set free, can make money," Mr. Rowland said.

   Following TWA's Lead, Major Airlines
   Cut Their Coast-to-Coast Fares by 50%

   Major airlines, still attempting to prop up sagging
earnings, slashed fares 50% on coast-to-coast flights.
   The $198 round-trip fares between some East Coast and West
Coast cities -- initiated by Trans World Airlines and quickly
followed by other major carriers -- are among the lowest
offered during the past decade for transcontinental travel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is the one that will bring people out of the
woodwork," predicted Thomas Nulty, president of Associated
Travel Services Inc., a Santa Ana, Calif., travel agency.
   However, industry analysts warned that while the lower
fares promise to spur travel, their effect on earnings is
unknown. "Whether or not this will generate profits, I'm not
sure," said Edward Starkman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   Net income continues to dive for most airlines. According
to the Air Transport Association, the industry trade group,
airlines had a $1 billion loss in the first half of the year,
compared with a loss of $63 million in the first half of last
year.
   "Now airlines are looking at their projected earnings for
the fall and they see that they have to do something," Mr.
Nulty said. "This will get travelers very excited."
   With the industry's summer peak travel season behind it,
TWA introduced the lower fares over the weekend "to try to
entice people to fly during this time of year when travel is
normally down," a TWA spokesman said.
   Aimed at leisure travelers, the Mount Kisco, N.Y.,
carrier's offer covers flights between Baltimore, Washington,
New York and Newark on the East Coast and Los Angeles,
Ontario, San Francisco and Santa Ana on the West Coast. The
tickets are non-refundable, require seven-day advance sales,
and must be purchased by Thursday for non-holiday travel
between Sept. 23 and Dec. 15.
   "This is as low as it goes for transcontinental travel,"
said Samuel Buttrick, an industry analyst at Kidder, Peabody
&amp; Co. "What I'd be wary of is that you want to control the
spread of this kind of pricing."
   Yesterday, as TWA began offering its fare cuts, United
Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., Chicago, and American
Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, not only
matched the TWA offer, but also added additional cities to
the promotion.
   United said it will add Oakland, San Jose, Long Beach and
Burbank -- all in California -- on the West Coast and White
Plains, N.Y. and New Haven, Conn., on the East Coast. "TWA
rolls out a shotgun and United rolls out a tank," said Mr.
Starkman. "This industry is just blistering competitive,
especially when bookings aren't there." Until recently, major
airlines would hardly have followed suit on TWA's promotion.
   In addition to matching the TWA offer, American Airlines
said it is offering $218 round-trip fares between the East
Coast and Oakland and San Jose. Industry sources say they
expect American to drop those prices to $198, to remain in
step with United. Delta Air Lines, based in Atlanta, and
USAir, a unit of USAir Group Inc., Arlington, Va., also moved
to match the TWA promotion, and likely will extend their
offers to the additional cities.

   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. said it is in preliminary talks to acquire the Southern Pacific railroad unit of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. 

   Kansas City Southern first expressed interest in buying the Southern Pacific unit in January. 
The talks mark the first time that the Chicago-based company has agreed to provide information about the unit to Kansas City Southern. 
"We are seriously negotiating," said Donald L. Graf, Kansas City Southern senior vice president of finance. 

   Kansas City Southern said it is mulling "certain proposals" that have been submitted to it by Santa Fe. 
Kansas City Southern, a railroad and data processing concern, said it expects to respond to the proposals in the next few weeks. 

   Santa Fe was ordered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in June to sell one of its two railroad units. 
The diversified railroad holding company is widely believed to be interested in selling the San Francisco-based Southern Pacific unit in order to retain the more profitable Chicago-based Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway unit. 
Some railroad analysts have estimated that the Southern Pacific unit could attract a bid of more than $1 billion. 

   In Chicago, a spokesman for Santa Fe said the company "would consider an offer from Kansas City Southern," but wouldn't comment on the talks. 

   Kansas City Southern is the only railroad operator so far that has publicly expressed interest in Southern Pacific, but it has yet to make a specific offer. 
Last month, a group of railroad unions representing Southern Pacific employees said it is fashioning a proposal to buy the unit. 

   In addition, Southern Pacific management is exploring a leveraged buy-out of the unit. 
In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is retired with money generated by the acquired company. 

   An acquisition of Southern Pacific would open the way into Southern California for Kansas City Southern. 
The Kansas City, Mo.-based concern currently operates a north-south line between Kansas City and the Gulf of Mexico, and an east-west line between Dallas and New Orleans. 

   Landon H. Rowland, Kansas City Southern president and chief executive officer, said late yesterday that if the company buys the railroad it probably would give closely held Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co. access to Southern Pacific's central California operation. 
He declined to elaborate. 

   An acquisition might help Kansas City Southern management ward off an unwanted suitor by making the company harder to swallow. 
In August, a group led by New York real estate developer Howard Kaskel disclosed that it held a 7.9% stake in Kansas City Southern and asked for regulatory approval to acquire control of the company. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kansas City Southern's stock fell 87.5 cents to close yesterday at $77.375 a share. 
Santa Fe shares closed at $51.50, down 50 cents, also on the Big Board. 

   Santa Fe was formed in 1983 through the merger of two railroad parent companies. 
In June, the Interstate Commerce Commission cited anti-competitive concerns to finally end the company's four-year struggle to combine the railroad units. 
The company has until Sept. 28 to submit a two-year railroad divestiture plan to the federal agency.

   Railroads Turn
   To Cutting Costs
   For Profit Gains

   Growth of 5% to 7% Is Seen
   In the Second Quarter;
   Industrial Freight Eased

   The railroad industry, turning to cost cuts to offset
continuing slow industrial freight shipments, is expected to
post average second-quarter earnings gains of 5% to 7%.
   For the expected strongest performer, Burlington Northern
Inc., earnings growth reflected robust coal and grain
shipments and the company's limited exposure to the vagaries
of new automobile shipments. But even railroads that are more
heavily dependent upon industrial freight shipments fared
reasonably well, analysts said, reflecting vigorous
cost-cutting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The railroads' improved efficiency is boosting earnings
in a lackluster economy," said Gary Yablon, an analyst at
Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., who expects the group's
second-quarter profit from continuing operations "to be up in
the mid-single digits." Mr. Yablon said railroads have
tightened scheduling of freight trains, lowered car-hire
costs, reduced manpower, cut material use, and reduced
little-used track.
   A Burlington Northern spokesman said the company is
"comfortable" with analysts' estimates that second-quarter
net income was about 81 cents a share compared with 74 cents
a share in the year-earlier period. The spokesman said
continued growth in coal shipments reflected new contracts
with utilities in the railroad's territory and test shipments
of low-sulfur Western coal to utilities in the Midwest and
East concerned about more stringent air pollution standards.
He added that Burlington Northern benefited from higher
shipments of corn to West Coast ports from the Midwest.
   CSX Corp., the only member of the group to disclose
results, reported last week that second-quarter net income
dropped 28%. However, CSX's earnings from continuing
operations rose 20%, reflecting improved results at rail,
barging and container shipping units.
   Analysts said that they expect Consolidated Rail Corp. to
post moderately higher earnings but that per-share earnings
for Union Pacific Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. will be
flat.
   Some analysts say rail operations were disappointing at
Santa Fe Pacific Corp., which faces tough competition for
freight from trucks and other railroads. Estimates of Santa
Fe's second-quarter earnings range from nil to two cents a
share. In the 1989 quarter, Santa Fe had net of $2.7 million,
or two cents a share. A Santa Fe spokesman wouldn't comment
on analysts' projections.
   Rail carloadings at the major railroads were up 1.3%,
according to the Association of American Railroads. Shipments
of coal rose 5.8%, chemicals were up 3.6%, and metals
increased 3.2%. Grain carloads were off about half a percent.
Carloadings of some higher-value freight were down, with
motor vehicles declining 4%, lumber 8.3% and paper less than
1%.
   Some analysts were cheered by the overall traffic gain.
"At this time a year ago tonnage was sliding, but now tonnage
is improving," said Andras Petery, an analyst at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.
   Michael Lloyd, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said
he is encouraged by rail shipments of finished automobiles,
which improved toward the end of the second quarter after a
very weak beginning. However, Mr. Lloyd believes that the
improvement partly reflects inventory -- building in
anticipation of a strike by the United Auto Workers union,
whose contract expires in September.
   "I'm worried that the stocks of the railroads will respond
positively to near-term traffic trends, trapping investors
for possible disappointment this fall," Mr. Lloyd said.
   When CSX reported that second-quarter net dropped to $109
million from $151 million, CSX said that earnings in the 1989
second period were inflated by gains from the sale of
subsidiaries. CSX said rail pretax operating profit rose
7.8%, reflecting improved coal tonnage that offset the extra
expense of an expanded locomotive repair program. Auto
traffic, while not reaching levels of the year-ago quarter,
improved sharply from the first period of 1990, the company
said. CSX said operating profit rose 40% at its
container-shipping unit, Sea-Land Service Inc., while
operating profit jumped 25% at the barge unit, reflecting
strong coal shipments and expanded operations at the marine
construction division.
   Some analysts expect Conrail to report second-quarter net
income of $1.30 to $1.40 a share compared with net of $1.19 a
share a year ago. One analyst said second-quarter results
included an after-tax gain of about 21 cents a share from
sale of a branch line. Conrail officials wouldn't comment on
analysts' estimates other than to say that traffic levels are
"relatively flat."
   Union Pacific officials said per-share earnings were about
the same as the $1.41 a share earned in the 1989 second
period, but net income fell slightly, reflecting higher
interest expense related to a share-repurchase program. The
officials cited earnings improvements at its rail, truck,
hazardous waste and real estate units. The officials said
earnings of the company's oil and gas unit won't match
after-tax earnings of $55 million in the year-ago quarter,
which included a $17 million gain on gas contract
settlements. Higher gas volumes in the recent quarter offset
price declines in oil and gas and flat oil volumes, the
officials said.
   They added that the rail unit benefited from a 1%
improvement in carloadings and a reduction in railroad work
force to 31,500 from 32,800 a year ago.
   Norfolk Southern wouldn't comment on analysts' projections
that net income was flat at 99 cents a share.

<TEXT>     Last vestiges of company;  "We're mindful that these are the last vestiges
of a company that was there when Sacramento was just a village," SP spokesman
Jerry Pera said.;    "But Sacramento isn't the railroad hub like it was then,"
he added. "We could liken the move to many other things that have changed in
society since then.";    Southern Pacific has evolved since Stanford and
co-founders Charles Crocker, Mark Hopkins and Collis P. Huntington -- known as
"the Big Four" to admirers, as "robber barons" to critics -- built the
nation's first transcontinental railroad.;    Today, their corporate legacy is
struggling in a modern railroad era of mergers and reorganizations, heavy
debt, tough competition and different transportation needs.;    "It's
certainly no secret that Southern Pacific is having financial difficulties,"
Pera said.;    145 employees laid off;  Those problems are reflected in the
company's decision last week to lay off 145 workers in Sacramento. Pera said
the action is necessary because there is not enough work for the employees,
who overhaul locomotives and make other heavy-duty repairs.;    The workers
could be recalled if more work becomes available, Pera said -- although the
shop eventually will be closed and moved to Denver.;    "Everyone knows that
Southern Pacific is struggling, and these layoffs are very clearly to reduce
costs," he said. "But there is no conscious effort to sell off properties or
lay off people just simply to pay down debt.";    Nevertheless, debt hangs
heavy over SP. Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz, who bought the railroad
from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. in 1988 for $1 billion, was left with a
debt of $1.7 billion.;    Efforts to slash debt;  To reduce the debt, the
company that once was the largest landholder in California has been selling
unused property. In 1989, SP sold a total of 5,800 acres for $350 million;
last year, the sale of track lines in the Los Angeles Basin to transit
officials brought $450 million.;    SP also has a letter of intent to sell 60
miles of lines stretching from San Francisco to San Jose for $300 million. The
company's historic San Francisco headquarters has been put on the block,
although it is not being actively marketed during the current real estate
slump, SP spokesman Mike Brown said.;    Five years ago, the company also
embarked on a plan to reduce its workforce of 30,000 by one-third. Today, SP
has 21,800 employees, Pera said.;    "Most of those are happening through
attrition . . . or layoffs if there isn't any work," he said. "For a while, we
were paying people to quit, but a company that's losing money can't afford to
do that.";    The sell-offs and downsizing have not been enough, however. SP
had reduced its debt by only $300 million last summer. Pera declined last week
to update that figure.;    Southern Pacific was the only major U.S. railroad
to report losses to the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1989 and 1990. The
San Francisco-based company lost $34 million in net income in 1989 -- it's
worst year since the Great Depression -- and $13 million last year.;    Union
officials in Sacramento said last week that SP officials told them the company
has lost $45 million since Jan. 1.;    Pera said the company's financial
troubles also stem partly from tough competition in the transportation
industry and changing needs among shippers.;    "Some commodities lend
themselves more to being shipped by (railroad) cars, like coal and grain," he
said. "We don't have tracks in those areas.";    About 30 percent of SP's
cargo is seagoing containers and flatbed trucks and trailers already loaded
with goods. The railroad has to compete for many of those shipments with the
trucking industry, which is mostly non-union and may ship goods directly and
to remote areas for much less money.;    "A lot of companies today order in
smaller shipments, one at a time," Pera said. "It's just enough to fit in a
truck.";    Founded in California, Southern Pacific has 20,000 miles of tracks
in 16 states in the West and Midwest. Its previous owner, Santa Fe Southern
Pacific Corp., is a Chicago holding company. Federal regulators forced it to
sell SP in 1987.;    With Anschutz based in Denver, speculation abounds that
the railroad that opened the West to a fledgling nation eventually may leave
its birthplace.  </TEXT>

   CHICAGO -- Santa Fe Pacific Corp. said Michael R. Haverty
resigned as president and chief operating officer of the
holding company's flagship Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe
Railway unit.
   Mr. Haverty, 46 years old, will be succeeded by Robert D.
Krebs, Santa Fe Pacific's chairman and chief executive
officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a news release, Mr. Haverty said the parent company's
recent spinoff of its energy and real estate operations, and
the combination of the railway and holding company
organizations have created "an increasing amount of overlap"
in the responsibilities of the railway head and Mr. Krebs. He
said he had, as a consequence, "decided to seize the moment
to pursue new challenges."
   Since assuming the company's top railroad job in 1989, Mr.
Haverty had drawn positive reviews from industry analysts.
Among the accomplishments they cite are his negotiation of
agreements with rail unions, which cut the size of train
crews.
   He also launched innovative intermodal services, such as a
joint venture with J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. Under
that program, Hunt trucks pick up and deliver freight for
shippers, but transfer it to high-speed Santa Fe trains
between the Midwest and West Coast.
   Mr. Haverty also helped to rebuild the railroad's image
after its aborted merger with Southern Pacific Transportation
Co.
   But with the parent company's recent spin-off of much of
its non-railroad holdings, it "appears that there is a lot
less for Michael Haverty to do now that Robert Krebs is able
to devote more of his time to the railroad," said PaineWebber
Inc. analyst Anthony Hatch.
   In an interview, Mr. Haverty acknowledged "overlapping
responsibilities" as one reason he decided to leave the
company and "look for some new opportunities" in the
transportation industry, though not necessarily in
railroading.

Loses 2 of 7 Bidders
For Transport Unit

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said the number of bidders for its Southern Pacific Transportation Co. unit has narrowed to five from seven, and that the lowest bid has increased to $900 million from $750 million. 
The company said the highest of the five bids is "well over $1 billion." 

   Separately, Henley Group Inc. is talking with several big banks about securing a $7 billion credit line for use in taking over all of Santa Fe Southern Pacific, individuals familiar with the talks said. 
There's no indication of how close to establishing the credit La Jolla, Calif.-based Henley might be. 
As previously reported, Henley has offered $63 a share in cash and securities, or about $9.94 billion, for the transportation, energy and real estate concern. 

   Officials at Santa Fe Southern declined to identify the suitors for Southern Pacific. 
But people familiar with the bids said they include offers from Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad, a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp.; a Southern Pacific management group; North Billerica, Mass.-based Guilford Transportation Industries Inc.; and the Railway Labor Executives Association, which represents Southern Pacific employees. 

   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. said late yesterday that it is also among the five bidders. 

   The company declined to identify which of the suitors had raised their offers. 
However, sources close to the bidding process said the management group and the Railway Labor union had increased their offers. 

   Santa Fe had set yesterday as the deadline for accepting firm bids for the railroad. 

   The labor union said previously that it offered $750 million for the railroad. 
Sources said the management group's original bid offered similar terms. 

   A spokesman for Southern Pacific confirmed late yesterday that the management group filed a revised bid, but declined to specify the changes. 
Railway union officials weren't immediately available. 

   Officials at Kansas City Southern and Denver Rio Grande declined to comment on the terms of their latest bids. 

   Santa Fe initially received two other bids, including one from Henley, which has since made its offer for the whole company. 
Sources said Chicago-based Itel Corp., another of the original bidders, dropped out after completing examining Southern Pacific's financial records. 
An Itel official declined to comment. 

   Santa Fe Southern shares closed yesterday at $51.75, up $1.875, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Santa Fe decided to sell Southern Pacific earlier this year after the Interstate Commerce Commission rejected its plan to merge that railroad with its Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe unit. 
The ICC ruled that such a combination was anti-competitive and ordered Santa Fe to shed one of its railroads. 

   In recent weeks, the fate of Southern Pacific has been dwarfed by the uncertainty surrounding its parent company. 
After Henley Group announced its offer for Santa Fe, Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., a Toronto-based real estate concern, said it may match "or better" Henley's offer. 

   The banks involved in the Henley financing include New York-based Citicorp; officials couldn't be reached for comment late yesterday. 
The names of other banks couldn't be definitively learned. 

   A spokesman for Henley, a manufacturing, engineering and financial services concern, declined comment on the possibility of such a credit line, which would be among the largest ever established. 

   As previously reported, Henley has accumulated a 14.1% stake in Chicago-based Santa Fe. 

   A Santa Fe spokesman said discussions are continuing with both Henley and Olympia &amp; York.

   An association representing the unionized employees of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s Southern Pacific railroad said it offered $750 million for the unit. 

   The Railway Labor Executives' Association said its bid was submitted together with a "parallel" offer from the management of the Southern Pacific unit. 
The two groups said they are working toward making a joint offer for the railroad. 

   Separately, Chicago-based Santa Fe said third-quarter net income soared nearly tenfold to $123.5 million, or 78 cents a share, reflecting a huge charge taken in the 1986 quarter and improved results for rail and oil operations. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Santa Fe Southern Pacific closed down $4.75, at $56.25 a share. 

   Yesterday had been set by Santa Fe as the deadline for bids for its Southern Pacific unit, which the company put on the block after its proposal to merge its two large railroad units was rejected by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 

   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., based in Kansas City, Mo., also submitted a bid for the railroad in conjunction with Warburg E.M. Pincus &amp; Co., Landon H. Rowland, president and chief executive officer said. 
Mr. Rowland wouldn't give details of the offer but said the company's investment banker is Lazard Freres &amp; Co. 

   Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co., a unit of Rio Grande Industries, is also among the list of bidders, said William J. Holtman, president. 
Rio Grande is a unit of Anschutz Corp. Mr. Holtman wouldn't elaborate on the company's offer. 

   In addition to the $750 million in cash, the Washington-based union group said its bid includes the assumption of Southern Pacific's long-term debt and other liabilities, unspecified cost savings, and the spinning back to Santa Fe of certain tax credits attached to the unit. 
The union group said the "full economic value" of its offer is $3.6 billion. 

   It added that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. would provide financing for its offer. 
In San Francisco, where the railroad is based, a Southern Pacific spokesman said the unit's long-term debt exceeds $800 million. 

   The management group wouldn't disclose details of its bid, but a spokesman said it is "similar" to the union group's bid and is based on retention of the railroad's core rail system. 
The group's investment banker is Hellman &amp; Friedman of San Francisco, the spokesman said. 

   A Santa Fe spokesman said the company has received several bids for its Southern Pacific unit, but he wouldn't elaborate. 

   For the 1986 third quarter, the holding company reported net income of $12.4 million, or eight cents a share. 
That included an after-tax charge of $70.5 million associated with the write-down of oil and gas properties. 

   Revenue for the 1987 third quarter rose 7.5% to $1.41 billion from $1.31 billion a year earlier. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific said pretax operating profit in its transportation group rose 43%, largely because of increased shipments of grain and piggybacked trailers and containers. 
Meanwhile, sharply higher oil prices and higher daily oil production pushed petroleum operations into the black; those operations bled badly last year. 

   For the nine months, Santa Fe Southern Pacific reported that net income more than doubled to $259.8 million, or $1.64 a share, as revenue rose 1.8% to $4.01 billion. 
A year earlier, the company earned $123.9 million, or 74 cents a share, on revenue of $3.94 billion.

KOLL CO., PARTNER BUY 297 ACRES FROM UNION PACIFIC

The Koll Co. and a Japanese partner have bought nearly 300 acres in Riverside 
County from Union Pacific Corp., and the Orange County developer said Wednesday 
it is negotiating to buy still more property from the railroad holding company. 
</P>
<P>
Koll and Ohbayashi America Corp., whose parent is one of the largest 
contractors in the world, paid $32 million for 297 acres in the unincorporated 
Mira Loma area at the northwestern tip of Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
The partners plan to turn the property into a business park. 
</P>
<P>
The deal comes several months after Koll's proposed $532-million purchase of 
most of Union Pacific's land and buildings fell through. It would have been 
Koll's biggest acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific, which operates the railroad of the same name, said the previous 
deal fell through because Koll and an unnamed partner couldn't prove they could 
come up with the money. Koll, however, said its financing was solid. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, since then Koll officials have continued to negotiate with Union 
Pacific for smaller pieces of property, including the Riverside County parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is Ohbayashi's second joint venture with Koll. The two 
companies are also building a $200-million, 28-story office tower in downtown 
Los Angeles. Ohbayashi has been in the development business in Southern 
California since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The partners said the Riverside County property will be used to construct 
buildings for lease or sale to businesses. They will also sell land to 
companies that want to construct their own buildings. The first parcels are 
expected to go on sale by the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
The huge Union Pacific deal that fell through included land and buildings in 19 
states. The Riverside County parcel was part of that transaction. 
</P>
<P>
One big West Coast developer who considered making an offer for the railroad 
property said recently that he considered it overpriced at half a billion 
dollars. Not so, said Chuck Schreiber, Koll Co. executive vice president in 
charge of acquiring property for the developer. 
</P>
<P>
"People who say that obviously didn't study the property very closely," he 
said. "We spent a lot of time looking at it, and we were very happy with the 
price." 
</P>
<P>
The deal included railroad property as far east as the Washington suburbs and 
would have given Koll -- which calls itself the West Coast's largest property 
owner -- a toehold in the East. 
</P>
<P>
When the deal was announced in January, Koll was a little vague about whether 
it would develop the Washington property. Now the company isn't saying whether 
it is still negotiating to buy any of the Eastern properties or whether it will 
stick to buying some of the railroad's numerous West Coast holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad is selling its real estate because the development business hasn't 
been profitable enough to boost publicly held Union Pacific's stock price much. 
The railroad wanted to concentrate on its other, more profitable businesses.

   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. would sell off a major section of the Southern Pacific railroad, for which it is readying a bid, to Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co., a person familiar with Kansas City Southern's strategy said. 

   The Southern Pacific section in question, between Ogden, Utah, and California, is one of three main Southern Pacific lines, and has long been coveted by closely held Denver &amp; Rio Grande. 
The section, which analysts suggested would have a value of roughly $130 million, would give the Denver-based concern much-needed access to California markets. 

   Kansas City Southern's designs on Southern Pacific, which is owned by Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., were first disclosed in January. 
If the plans lead to any acquisition, they might have the additional benefit of discouraging an unwanted suitor for Kansas City Southern. 

   A spokesman for Santa Fe Southern Pacific said the company will consider any offers made for the Southern Pacific railroad. 
He said Kansas City Southern hasn't bid for the railroad. 
Kansas City Southern said it is still waiting for additional financial data on the railroad before setting a purchase price. 

   A group led by New York investor Howard Kaskel disclosed earlier this month that it has acquired a 7.9% stake in the Kansas City, Mo.-based railroad and data-processing concern. 
The group also has asked the government for clearance to seek control. 

   The Kaskel group has said it opposes Kansas City Southern's plans to bid for Southern Pacific and, in conversations between the two sides' Wall Street representatives, has said it believes Southern Pacific would be a drag on Kansas City Southern's earnings. 

   Samuel Freeman, a lawyer representing Denver &amp; Rio Grande, confirmed that his company is interested in acquiring the Southern Pacific section, as well as another route from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., from either Southern Pacific or Kansas City Southern. 

   A Kansas City Southern spokesman said the company would be interested in selling pieces of Southern Pacific, but he didn't specify which ones. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific, formed in 1983 through the merger of the parent companies of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads, has been ordered by the Interstate Commerce Commission to sell one of the railroad units. 
It is widely believed that the Chicago-based company will attempt to shed Southern Pacific, which, if sold, could fetch a price of more than $1 billion, railroad analysts have suggested. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific is considering a number of alternatives, including a sale or spinoff of all or part of the Southern Pacific unit, and is expected to file a divestiture plan with the ICC by Sept. 28. 
In addition, both the unit's management and its employees are considering leveraged buyout offers. 

   Kansas City Southern, however, is the only concern that has so far publicly expressed an interest in Southern Pacific. 

   In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said it reached another agreement with a railroad company in an effort to win support for the proposed merger of its two railway units -- the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific. 

   The latest agreement is with Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co., a unit of Katy Industries Inc., Elgin, Ill. 
Santa Fe Southern Pacific said Missouri-Kansas-Texas will be given trackage rights over certain lines in Texas. 
In exchange, Missouri-Kansas-Texas said it will support the proposed merger, assuming the trackage-rights agreement is approved by the federal government. 

   As reported, the Interstate Commerce Commission stunned the railroad industry last July by rejecting a plan to merge Santa Fe and Southern Pacific. 
The agency cited anti-competitive problems with the merger. 
The two railway units have operated separately since their parents, Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Corp., combined in 1983 to form Santa Fe Southern Pacific. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific recently appealed the ICC ruling. 
To drum up support for the appeal, the company agreed to give Union Pacific Corp. the right to operate on some of the units' lines and reached a similar agreement with Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad.

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said Friday that it wants to sell its ailing Southern Pacific railroad unit to comply with a federal divestiture order that it dispose of one of its two rail systems. 

   As expected, the diversified holding company said in a filing with the Interstate Commerce Commission that it wants to keep its more profitable Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway unit, based here. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific said it is studying whether to sell San Francisco-based Southern Pacific as a whole or piecemeal, or whether to spin off the unit to shareholders. 

   As previously reported, the holding company already has held talks about a sale of the unit with Kansas City, Mo.-based Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. and closely held Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co. Groups representing Southern Pacific management and its unions also have shown interest in acquiring the unit. 

   An ICC spokesman said the agency would have to approve the sale of Southern Pacific operations to other railroads. 
In June, the ICC ordered the railroad divestiture because of anti-competitive concerns.

Santa Fe's Schmidt Won't Accept 'No'

   Companies that gripe about how long it takes to complete a merger should consider the plight of John J. Schmidt, chairman of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. 
He's been trying to conclude the same transaction for four years. 

   His struggle is to merge the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway with the Southern Pacific railroad, a move that would create the second-largest U.S. railroad. 
The transaction has been in limbo since 1983, pending antitrust clearance from the Interstate Commerce Commission. 

   Last summer, a strategical blunder by Mr. Schmidt nearly killed the merger. 
Afraid the ICC might require concessions to Santa Fe competitors, the executive insisted that the commission either approve the proposal intact or reject it. 
The ICC went along with those terms, and in a decision that stunned the industry, rejected the plan. 

   Mr. Schmidt has since regrouped with Santa Fe attorneys and asked the ICC to rehear the case -- this time with concessions already built in. 
He also has put together a huge list of endorsers of the merger, including customers, other railroads and city and state governments. 

   Although the commission has agreed to rethink its position and a decision is expected during the next four months, some industry observers have begun to question whether Mr. Schmidt's dogged persistence makes sense -- especially given the ICC's historic reluctance to reverse itself. 

   "There are two schools of thought about what he's doing," says Jeffrey Stone, a railroad analyst with Wertheim &amp; Co. in New York. 
"There are those who think he's being very pragmatic and practical and doing something right for the company, but very difficult. 
There's another school of thought that says he's a Don Quixote." 

   Mr. Schmidt was so confident of ICC approval that on the day the agency met, he scheduled a lunch meeting with analysts to discuss the presumed victory. 
Santa Fe officials had to cancel the session hastily. 

   Santa Fe's board still supports the merger, though not without some doubts, says director Robert H. West, president of Butler Manufacturing Inc. "We've given away more than we would like to (in concessions to other railroads). 
Whether it's too much will be measured retrospectively," Mr. West said. 

   Mr. Schmidt insists the concessions the company has made as part of its latest proposal actually may result in a better transaction. 
He says the plan would cut costs at the combined railroad by $300 million annually, slightly more than originally forecast. 

   The concessions mainly involve settlements with other railroads that opposed the merger. 
They allow the other carriers to use certain stretches of Santa Fe or Southern Pacific track, in return for reciprocal arrangements or other considerations. 
In return, the competitors have agreed to support the merger. 

   "I think Santa Fe has done as well as it could under the circumstances and probably better than most anyone could have expected," said Samuel Freeman, vice president and general counsel of Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad. 

   Unlike his predecessor John Reed, a railroad buff who moved up the ranks from track maintenance supervisor to chairman, Mr. Schmidt, 59 years old, started out as a company lawyer and has been more active in legal associations than railroad groups. 

   Those who have worked with him say he exhibits a lawyer's attention to detail, sometimes pointing out even the slightest discrepancies in a report. 
In staff discussions, he also often brings up his responsibility to shareholders. 

   With the same dogged determination he has shown in the merger battle, he took up long-distance running 20 years ago, when he was "fat, sloppy and couldn't even run two blocks" and two friends his age had already died of heart attacks, he says. 
He eats carrots, apples and oranges for lunch and runs 15 miles a week, often along the lake front here. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific has earned money during most of his five-year tenure, but posted a net loss of $137.9 million for 1986, compared with net income of $469.6 million a year earlier. 
Mr. Schmidt blamed the deficit mainly on the collapse of oil prices that affected Santa Fe's petroleum operations. 

   The Santa Fe railroad posted an operating loss of $142 million for 1986; Southern Pacific had an operating loss of $586.9 million. 
Company officials say the losses were high because of certain restructuring costs and special charges. 

   If the ICC again rejects the merger, Santa Fe will be forced to sell at least one of its railroads. 
While the Southern Pacific is already owned by the company, it has been held in a separate trust and operated independently since 1983 pending a final ICC decision. 

   Investment advisers who work for Santa Fe shareholders said they believe that a negative decision would benefit the company's stockholders, because the company would realize a short-term infusion of funds from the sale of one of its carriers. 
The advisers maintain, however, that the Santa Fe would gain more long-term benefits if the merger were approved. 

   Mr. Schmidt won't say what he will do if the ICC again rejects the case. 
Harking back to his childhood in a tough neighborhood in downtown Chicago, he says: "I'm used to winning, and I'm used to losing. 
When I lose, I get up and keep trying."

   A federal court has canceled a scheduled
Friday hearing on Kansas City Southern Industries' application for
a stay of a recent court order barring its efforts to purchase the
Southern Pacific Railroad.
   KCSI president and chief executive Landon Rowland said he asked
the court to cancel the hearing on the advice of company attorneys,
who said it was ``procedurally not ripe'' to have the hearing now.
   He said the cancellation had nothing to do with Tuesday's
Interstate Commerce Commission approval of Rio Grande Industries
Inc.'s proposal to buy Southern Pacific.
   The ICC in a series of votes Tuesday rejected the Kansas City
Southern proposal, partly due to concern over Kansas City
Southern's financial outlook in light of a $600 million court
judgment against the company.
   In April, a U.S. District Court jury in South Dakota returned a
verdict that Kansas City Southern had violated antitrust laws by
helping block a coal slurry pipeline that would have taken some of
the railroad's business, and awarded the judgment to the state of
South Dakota.
   The verdict is being appealed to the 8th Circuit Court of
Appeals in St. Paul, Minn.
   A federal judge in Sioux Falls, S.D., recently ruled that KCSI
could not buy Southern Pacific Railroad while it is appealing the
judgment.
   ``We think its moot in view of the fact that the order has not
been entered in South Dakota,'' Rowland said of Friday's court
hearing.
   Southern Pacific, part of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., has
15,000 miles of track and is one of the oldest rail lines in the
nation, with track stretching from Oregon to Louisiana.
   Sante Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries
on the sale last February, but when permission for the transaction
was sought from the ICC, Kansas City Southern objected and asked
that it be allowed to buy the railroad.
   Roland said the company's offer to buy Southern Pacific ``is
still on the table,'' and said the company would review all its
options when the full commission decision is released.

   Alaska Air Group said it plans to terminate on Oct. 1 the Midwest and East Coast flights of its recently acquired subsidiary, Jet America of Long Beach, Calif. 

   It also completed the previously announced sale to the United Airlines unit of Allegis Corp. of Jet America's gates at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and National Airport in Washington D.C. Company officials wouldn't disclose the price, but based on recent sales of airport gates Alaska Air is believed to have fetched at least $11 million. 

   Alaska Air paid about $31 million for Jet America in a transaction completed in December. 
J.R. Vingo, the company's chief financial officer, said the sale of some of Jet America's eight jet aircraft is also being evaluated but no decision has been made. 

   Mr. Vingo said that major competitors such as Trans World Airlines and Delta Air Lines were recently allowed to fly routes to the Midwest and other destinations out of Long Beach. 
"The competition from megacarriers eliminated any prospect of Jet America competing in those markets," he said. 

   Jet America will continue to serve the Portland-Seattle market and certain other California and West Coast markets, Mr. Vingo said. 
Alaska Air's other subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, flies routes from Alaska to most West Coast airports and to Phoenix and Tucson. 

   Alaska Air Group had a first-quarter loss of $5.3 million, compared with a loss of $4.8 million in the year-ago period.

   The growth of Southeast Asian manufacturing is putting its
stamp on container shipping, spawning new services to ferry
the region's goods through the Suez Canal to the U.S. East
Coast.
   These "pendulum services" -- shuttling back and forth
between the two regions -- reduce delivery times by making
fewer stops en route than the more-established
around-the-world operations covering the same territory. They
also offer another alternative to Pacific land-bridge
services, which ship Asian cargo to the U.S. West Coast and
load it onto trains bound for the Midwest and East Coast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One new service in particular -- the Asia-East Coast
Express, operated by Singapore-based Neptune Orient Lines
Ltd. (NOL) in partnership with Japan's Nippon Yusen Kaisha --
is being watched by both the shipping industry, which has
been hurt by recession and overcapacity in recent years, and
by East Coast ports, which are eager to grab more of the
lucrative Asian market dominated by West Coast rivals.
   The Suez route doesn't pose any near-term threat to the
Pacific Rim shipping business, according to businessmen and
analysts. But it gives some East Coast ports a needed boost
and points to the increasing importance of Southeast Asia as
a manufacturing center.
   "The Asian manufacturing base moving south is changing
the game, the whole playing field" in the cargo industry,
says Arnold Davis, spokesman for the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey. Ports such as New York, Norfolk, Va.,
and Charleston, S.C., "are certainly a beneficiary of this
new development, and we're excited about it."
   Lower labor costs have attracted many international
companies to Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and parts of India
and Pakistan. The region has taken over production of many
lower-value-added goods from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.
U.S. retailers' demand for these goods, especially in the
volatile apparel and toy industries, has given rise to calls
for speedier transport from the region to the U.S., says
Patrick Mongno, senior vice president of Tricom Shipping
Agencies Inc. of New York, the general agents for NOL.
   Much of Southeast Asia's cargo feeds into Singapore, which
in 1990 surpassed Hong Kong as the world's busiest container
port. Because Singapore, via the Suez, is closer to the U.S.
East Coast and doesn't require a rail link to get to the
seaboard's major markets, it makes sense for shipments to
that area, says Mr. Davis. In an increasingly competitive
industry, the carriers "want to use their main asset, the
ship, as much as possible and minimize rail and trucking
trips," he says, adding that "the Singapore route is a
natural progression of this trend."
   NOL's express service, the only nonstop service between
Singapore and New York, starts Dec. 7 and departs from
Singapore every 10 days. The company says it will take 22
days for cargo to reach New York. That betters by two weeks
NOL's all-water East Coast service through the Panama Canal,
which ends this month, and equals the best landbridge service
between Singapore and New York via the West Coast.
   The NOL express ships also will stop in Norfolk and
Charleston, and will call in Halifax, Nova Scotia, before
heading back across the Atlantic to Singapore. The service
then stops in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore again, before
returning for New York.
   NOL is operating the venture with backing from another
major Asian shipping company, Japan's NYK Line. NYK will
supply four of the six ships to be used on the route, and
will itself charter about 14% of the service's capacity.
   Earlier this year, Dubai-based United Arab Shipping Co.
started a smaller-capacity, 32-day service between Singapore
and the U.S. East Coast, with stops in New York, Baltimore,
Norfolk and Savannah, Ga., as well as Middle Eastern and
Mediterranean ports.
   The companies are "targeting a niche market, for
time-sensitive items that need to move from manufacturers to
retailers quickly," says Nai Boon Hiong, who tracks NOL for
Schroder International Merchant Bankers Ltd. in Singapore.
"The prospects are very good."
   NOL and NYK hope to increase the frequency of their
sailings to every seven days by the middle of 1992. They say
the main selling point of their service is speed. Other lines
move cargo on all-water routes from Southeast Asia to the
East Coast, but generally as part of around-the-world routes,
with many stops.
   In comparison with land-bridge routes, all-water service
doesn't require a transfer of cargo to railroads, and
therefore is more reliable, says Donald McCallian, general
manager and assistant to senior corporate executives for NYK
Line (North America) Inc. "One move instead of two is always
good in this business," he says.
   The goods coming in from Southeast Asia consist mostly of
"anything you can buy in a department store," says Mr.
Mongno. Toys, apparel, small appliances and some electronics
equipment are expected to fill the service's containers.
   What's going out from the U.S., Mr. Mongno says, is
"basically one step above junk" -- scrap paper and plastics,
chemical residues and logs that the Asians recycle or hone
into new products.
   Southeast Asia appears well positioned for more growth,
and the shipping companies are trying to prepare for that,
analysts say. NOL, for instance, has expanded its network of
relay services within Asia, starting a feeder route between
Vietnam and Singapore, and is making more feeder trips to and
from Bangkok, Thailand, as well as India and Pakistan.
   NYK, meanwhile, has reduced its transit time between
Singapore and Los Angeles to 18 days, and is maintaining its
around-the-world service to the East Coast through the Panama
Canal.
   Other major container lines are looking into the
possibility of pendulum services between Singapore and the
East Coast, according to Mr. Davis. Most observers agree that
the Suez route has potential, but there are obstacles to its
growth.
   Land-bridge services to move Southeast Asian container
cargo from East Coast ports as far west as Chicago and north
to Toronto make geographical sense, says John Covaney, senior
managing director of marketing for the port of Norfolk. "You
can have a much lower distribution cost in the East," he
says.
   But East Coast ports lag their West Coast competitors in
experience with such transport, industry participants say,
and large retailers may resist rerouting their distribution
networks.
   Perhaps more important, several major shippers have
long-term investments in U.S. land-bridge services that will
encourage them to continue unloading cargo on the West Coast
and transporting it by rail to the East, industry observers
say.
   They also point out that as fast as Southeast Asian
countries are growing, their exports to the U.S. aren't
likely to overtake those of the South Koreans, Taiwanese and
Japanese any time soon. "Bear in mind that the import market
from Southeast Asia is tiny compared to East Asia," says
NYK's Mr. McCallian.
   Officials at West Coast ports, some of which saw years of
double-digit growth in cargo loads because of Asian imports
in the 1980s, don't seem to be worried. Jeff Leong, spokesman
for the Port of Los Angeles, points out that the major
container lines, including NYK and NOL, are expanding rather
than diminishing their presence in West Coast ports, in some
cases building new terminals.
   Still, Schroder's Mr. Nai believes the Suez route will
prove attractive to shippers. "We see an acceleration of the
region's growth in the next two years," he says. "Perhaps
within a year or two, other companies also will be coming
in."

and was the only major carrier to report a loss.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Athough once the largest private landowner in California, Southern Pacific
has sold $1.2 billion worth of property and track rights since Philip F.
Anschutz bought the company for $1.02 billion in 1988, raising operating cash
and reducing the $1.7 billion debt that faced the Denver billionaire.;   
Despite recent losses, Southern Pacific officials remain optimistic about the
future because their real estate sales have offset operating losses of the
last two years and because the loss was less last year than in 1989.;    "What
we're convinced of is, if there hadn't been a recession and Persian Gulf war
and a spike in fuel costs, '91 would have been a profitable year," said
Southern Pacific spokesman Michael Brown. Because of those reasons, though,
the company suffered a "significant" operating loss in the first quarter.;   
Still, the Sacramento River spill on July 14 and the subsequent Ventura County
derailment near Seacliff on July 28 -- when ruptured drums leaked a form of
rocket fuel -- can only exacerbate the company's financial troubles and may be
symptomatic of deeper problems.;    The carrier has had financial troubles for
the last 10 years, said Joel Price, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin and
Jenrette in New York. "With the events of the last two weeks, God only knows
what the effect will be.";    Southern Pacific has not given a cost estimate
for the derailment by the Sacramento River near Dunsmuir because there are
liability questions to settle, Brown said.;    However, the Journal of
Commerce, citing environmental agencies, reported an estimate of more than $25
million.;    Brown would not disclose the details of the carrier's insurance
policy, nor how the company would handle the costs.;    Investigators say that
power surges from a faulty electrical generator in a locomotive may have
caused the Sacramento River derailment, and that a faulty bearing may have
caused an axle to snap in the Seacliff accident.;    Some observers question
whether the company's level of maintenance played a role in the accidents.;   
"I think it (the Seacliff derailment) will raise questions, perhaps wrongfully
so, about whether SP's operations and maintenance are up to par," Michael
Lloyd, a rail analyst with Saloman Brothers in New York, told the Journal of
Commerce.;    Sometimes railroad companies cut down on maintenance in poor
economic years, waiting for a profitable year to spend money fixing assets,
said Anthony Hatch, an analyst with PaineWebber in New York.;    "It used to
happen a lot more" in the 1970s, he said. "There should be some drop in a bad
year, because you're not using as many cars, and you don't break down the
tracks as much. But if you're cutting down more, that's a sign of financial
weakness.";    Brown denied that Southern Pacific had been lax on maintenance,
pointing out that since 1988, $730 million has gone into capital expenditures,
mostly maintenance and safety-related spending.;    "That is not the action of
a company deferring maintenance," he said.;    But federal reviews of Southern
Pacific's operations indicate a high accident rate and a high percentage of
defects in locomotives.;    In June, the Federal Railroad Administration
inspected Southern Pacific locomotives in Nevada, California and Arizona, and
found that 206 out of 248 -- or 83 percent -- had at least one defect.;    And
from 1986 to 1990, Southern Pacific was virtually tied with CSX Transportation
for the highest rate of rail accidents involving hazardous materials, with
1.05 and 1.06 accidents, respectively, per million train miles, according to
the federal agency. In 1990, Southern Pacific was easily the highest, at 1.20,
compared to 1.10 for CSX.;    "It would be fair to say if they invested more
in safety, they would have a better safety record," said Robert Creamer,
spokesman for Citizen Action on Rail Safety.;    After it deals with the
derailment costs, Southern Pacific still has to overcome some business
problems.;    The company's fate depends heavily on shipping automobiles,
lumber and chemicals, all of which are very sensitive to the economy, said
John Hilton, an analyst with Argus Research Corp. in New York.;    Lumber,
which accounted for almost 15 percent of Southern Pacific's freight revenue in
1990, fluctuates because its major use is to build houses, and the housing
market is tied to the economy's health. The automobile market, which accounted
for 9.1 percent of freight revenues, also has been depressed in recent years.;
   Meanwhile, Southern Pacific ships few "cushion" goods that are
recession-resistant, like coal.;    Southern Pacific's 7 percent share of the
overall market is threatened by healthier rail companies.;    "Union Pacific
is really beginning to make big money," Price said. As a result, Union Pacific
will probably invest more in capital improvements to lower costs and become an
even tougher foe.;    The Omaha, Neb.-based transporter -- one of the three
biggest with 21,000 miles of track -- expanded a major coal line running
through Nebraska and installed a large automobile loading facility in Los
Angeles.;    To compete, Price said, "you need resources. If you're running on
a shoestring budget, that's almost conceding defeat.";    Southern Pacific is
not helpless, though. In addition to its real estate assets, it does have
valuable routes stretching along the Pacific coast, from Los Angeles to
Portland, Ore., which "all other things being equal," could form a solid core
for a railroad carrier, Hatch said. "You give me that route in perfect shape,
I'll take it.";  California rail history; (box) 1862 -- President Lincoln

L.A.'S UNION STATION SOLD TO SANTA FE PACIFIC REALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Historic Union Station has been sold and its owners plan extensive improvements 
for the 51-year-old building and possible future development to reestablish the 
nearly 50-acre site as a regional transportation hub, it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific Realty said Monday that it bought the 22% interest in the 
downtown station that Union Pacific Railroad has owned since 1939. That's when 
the railroad joined with the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads to build 
the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, as the Spanish-style, art-deco 
flavored depot is formally known. Terms of the deal, which involved an exchange 
of real estate, were not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific Realty disclosed that in the last month it bought the 44% 
stake held by Southern Pacific for cash on Dec. 31. The value of the deal was 
not revealed. The company also said it traded real estate for the 34% stake 
owned by its sister company and former parent, Santa Fe Pacific Corp., formerly 
known as Santa Fe Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The convoluted transaction is one of the more minor repercussions of the failed 
merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads. 
</P>
<P>
After that merger was disallowed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1987, 
the Southern Pacific Railroad was sold and Chicago-based Santa Fe Pacific was 
radically restructured. Southern Pacific Railroad's new owner, Philip Anschutz, 
began selling some non-rail properties, including the Union Station interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Our acquisition of this landmark property will enable us to initiate an 
extensive improvement plan and to begin urban planning efforts aimed at 
reestablishing the facility as a regional transportation hub," said Vernon B. 
Schwartz, chief executive of Santa Fe Pacific Realty, based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Future development could include offices, stores and restaurants, said Ted 
Tanner, director of development for the property. But any project must await 
completion of construction of a Metro Rail station there, he said, adding that 
the station won't be finished for about two more years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Amtrak, which has provided passenger service at Union Station 
since 1971, is about to move into new facilities on the property, which would 
free much of the station for renovation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal here clearly is to maintain and preserve the historic character of 
the building," Tanner said.

   Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which last week said it wouldn't bid for Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., has increased its stake in the giant railroad, energy and real estate concern. 

   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Olympia &amp; York, a Toronto-based real estate developer controlled by the Reichmann family, said it increased its holding to 8.2% from 6.9%. 

   The move ensures that Olympia &amp; York is still a force to contend with as Santa Fe tries to steel itself against potential hostile bidders. 
It also steps up pressure on Santa Fe's management at a time when it is trying to beat back a takeover threat from La Jolla, Calif.-based Henley Group Inc. 

   Henley, a diversified manufacturing concern, holds a 14.7% stake in Santa Fe. 
That holding, combined with Olympia &amp; York's latest purchase, puts nearly a fourth of Santa Fe's stock in unfriendly hands. 

   In recent days, Santa Fe's management has taken a variety of steps to repel potential hostile suitors. 

   Henley said last week that it might make a tender offer for the Santa Fe shares it doesn't already own after merger talks with Santa Fe broke down. 
As a countermeasure, Santa Fe said it was "willing to consider certain transactions" that would enable the company to regain control of Henley's Santa Fe stock. 

   People close to Santa Fe said its chairman and chief executive officer, Robert D. Krebs, has been trying to speed up the sale of company assets to raise cash toward that end. 
Mr. Krebs also proposed paying Santa Fe shareholders $4 billion in cash or securities or both, with a twofold purpose in mind: leveraging the company to make it less attractive to potential bidders, and placating other large shareholders in case Henley had to be bought off. 

   Last week, Olympia &amp; York announced that it had decided against making a $63-a-share offer for Chicago-based Santa Fe, but said it might still accumulate Santa Fe stock and remained interested in discussing a company restructuring. 
A $63 cash offer was the price that the Santa Fe board had said it would consider. 

   If Santa Fe decides to buy back Henley's stake at a premium, Olympia &amp; York may also have to be satisfied. 
At the same time, Olympia &amp; York is well-positioned to join forces with Henley at some point if it so desires. 

   In its filing, the company said it had acquired an additional 1,917,800 Santa Fe shares between Dec. 9 and Wednesday at $39.75 to $48.064 each and now controls 12,837,000 Santa Fe shares. 
Olympia &amp; York officials declined to comment further. 

   Santa Fe shares closed at $46.875, down $1.875, in active composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. 

   Whatever happens in the next few months, it is certain Santa Fe will be changed forever. 

   Under Mr. Krebs's plan, Santa Fe will remain a railroad, natural-resources and real-estate concern, but in a scaled-back form. 
Mr. Krebs has moved already to sell some of Santa Fe's smaller businesses, such as its building-contracting unit, its timber company and the Bankers Leasing &amp; Financial Corp. subsidiary. 
Santa Fe said it expects to receive $680 million pretax for these businesses. 

   Santa Fe is expected to announce as early as today the sale of its Southern Pacific Transportation Co. unit. 
An official familiar with the bidding process said Kansas City, Mo.-based Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. and Rio Grande Western Railroad, a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp., were among the top bidders. 

   The official said that Kansas City Southern valued its bid at $1.8 billion and that Rio Grande had offered to match that. 

   Both Henley and Olympia &amp; York are said to be interested mainly in Santa Fe's vast real estate holdings, valued at an estimated $5 billion. 
Many railroad industry analysts believe Henley would proceed to sell the company's assets piecemeal if it succeeds in a takeover. 

   "There are two scenarios I see playing out," said an official close to the company. 
"Santa Fe will either remain an independent transportation, oil and gas and real estate company, albeit a smaller one, or all of the assets will be liquidated." 

   Even if Henley prevails over Santa Fe management, its plans may face obstacles at the Interstate Commerce Commission -- where jockeying against Henley is under way. 

   Santa Fe decided to sell the Southern Pacific after the ICC ordered the company to shed one of its two railroad units, citing anti-competitive concerns. 
Henley has told commissioners informally that if it is successful in acquiring Santa Fe, it will likely sell the more profitable Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway, and reorganize the Southern Pacific. 

   An ICC official said commissioners are concerned that Henley would sell the Southern Pacific in pieces, keeping only its valuable real estate. 
Southern Pacific owns vast tracts of land in Southern California, including spectacular coastline potentially attractive for real-estate development. 

   Such a plan "gave people around here acute heartburn," one commission staffer said. 

   Other bidders for the Southern Pacific are reportedly lobbying the commission to use its authority to thwart Henley.

   The purchase by the Union Pacific Corp., of
the ``Katy'' railroad, a regional line that runs from Nebraska to
the Gulf Coast, has been approved by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the agency announced today.
   The ICC's approval requires the Union Pacific and the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, as the ``Katy'' is formally known,
to grant trackage rights to other railroads inseveral regions where
direct competition otherwise would be reduced.
   The ICC approved the merger Friday, but it was not announced
until today, agency officials said.
   The commission acknowledged that the merger would result in the
elimination of some jobs and abandonment of more than 300 miles of
tracks where the two rail systems run parallel tracks. The
railroads have said about 1,000 jobs would be eliminated.
   The commission concluded, however, that the benefits of the
merger both to the public and to rail shippers outweigh the
negative impact. ``The public benefits will be achieved through
reduced transportation costs ... and improved service for
shippers,'' said Heather Gradison, ICC chairman, in a statement.
   The ICC said about 300 miles of track has been approved for
abandonment, including a 123-mile stretch from Henriette to Durant
in Oklahoma. The railroads have said facilities would be shut down
in St. Louis, Kansas City, Fort Worth and other points along the
route system because of duplication.
   Ackowledging a concern about reduced competition for Midwest
grain shipments, the ICC said the Union Pacific must provide
trackage rights to another railroad between Omaha and Kansas City
to preserve the current level of competition.
   It also required agreements with other rail lines in south Texas
where there were competitive concerns about the shipment of crushed
rock from various Texas points to Houston. An agreement with the
Southern Pacific has alleviated that concern, ICC officials said.

<HL> ICC Clears Union Pacific's Plan to Buy
Overnite Transportation for $1.2 Billion

   The Interstate Commerce Commission unanimously approved Union Pacific Corp.'s proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of Overnite Transportation Co., the most recent and ambitious effort by a railroad to enter the trucking business. 

   The decision extends the reach of New York-based Union Pacific, whose railroad operations are principally west of the Mississippi River, into the eastern half of the U.S., where Richmond, Va.-based Overnite has concentrated its operations. 
Overnite is the nation's fifth-largest motor carrier of general freight. 

   Union Pacific follows other railroads that have emerged as integrated transportation companies offering a sort of one-stop shopping for shippers. 
In recent years, CSX Corp., a railroad holding concern, has bought the ocean shipping company SeaLand Corp., has launched a truck line and bought a barge company. 
Another railway company, Norfolk Southern Corp., last year bought North American Van Lines, a trucking company. 

   The merger was hailed by Union Pacific Chairman William Cook, who said it will "greatly increase our ability to provide our customers with efficient door-to-door service." 
Mr. Cook added that Union Pacific expects to create a "wide range of new choices in multi-modal transportation services for shippers throughout the country." 

   Some rail analysts expect Union Pacific to offer new transcontinental services by tying Overnite's truck routes in the East with Union Pacific's trains in the West. 

   But other rail experts question whether railroads need to buy truck companies in order to offer such services. 
"The burden of proof is on Union Pacific to prove that there are efficiencies accompanying ownership of a truck line that aren't available through cooperative agreements with a truck line," said Jeffrey Stone, a transportation analyst at Wertheim &amp; Co. 
"It's hard for me to detect any greater synergies." 

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Union Pacific closed at $78.625, down 37.5 cents. 

   The merger isn't likely to spur additional purchases of truck lines by railroads, however. 
Last year, a federal appeals court instructed the ICC to apply more-restrictive standards to railroad acquisitions of truck lines, which could chill future mergers of railroads and truck lines. 

   "We tried to give intermodalism a green light, but the court kind of messed it up a little," said one commission staff member. 
Still, he echoed analysts' views that the railroad and trucking companies still could use marketing agreements to offer shippers a wider range of services. 
But he said legislation may be necessary to permit the commission to return to its more lenient standard for approving rail and truck mergers. 
The Union Pacific-Overnite merger was specifically permitted in legislation late last year. 

   Union Pacific agreed to acquire Overnite a year ago for $43.25 a share. 
The shares have been held by Union Pacific in a voting trust pending final ICC approval. 
In giving the transaction the green light, the commission cited "considerable public benefits, including increased efficiencies and additional service options." 

   The acquisition's only opposition came from the United Transportation Union, a Cleveland-based union of 125,000 rail and bus employees. 
"We're fearful that UP may be going into the trucking business rather than concentrating on the railroad business," said Fred Hardin, president of the union. 
He said other big railroad holding companies are trimming their rail holdings by selling off or abandoning thousands of miles of tracks.

   In "The Santa Fe Fears a Rail Regulatory Relapse" (Business World, April 7), George Melloan argues that a second rejection by the ICC of a merger between the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads would be a disturbing reversal of deregulation. 
Mr. Melloan mischaracterizes both the reduction in rail regulation that has occurred since the passage of the Staggers Act of 1980 and the ICC's competitive analysis of the proposed merger. 

   The Staggers Act did not deregulate the railroads. 
It did free them from a great deal of regulation, where sufficient competition exists, but it also left in place a variety of regulations designed to "balance the needs of carriers, shippers and the public." 
Perhaps the most important remains the ICC's responsibility to establish maximum reasonable rail rates for movements not subject to effective competition. 

   This places a heavy burden on the ICC to protect competition where it exists. 
The ICC rejected the SF-SP merger because it would have significantly reduced transportation competition and, as a result, would have increased the need to regulate rail rates. 

   Mr. Melloan argues that few if any shippers are truly captive to railroads because many shippers can choose between rail and highway. 
There are, however, a significant number of shippers that cannot economically use trucks. 
Mr. Melloan incorrectly characterizes as "esoteric" the debate before the ICC over whether trucks are competitive on hauls of more than 1,000 miles. 
Generally, a lessening of railroad competition on these longer hauls cannot be attenuated by competition from trucks. 
The ICC's decision to reject the merger was based on a determination, in which the Justice Department concurred, that the merger would reduce overall transportation competition, not just rail competition, for a significant amount of traffic. 

   Mr. Melloan also mischaracterizes the role of mergers in reviving the badly rundown rail system that existed at the time the Staggers Act was passed. 
The reductions in costs that have been achieved in the past six years have principally resulted from non-merger provisions in the Staggers Act that allow the abandonment of unprofitable lines, the formation of nonunion short-line railroads, the tailoring of rates and service through contracts, and the rationalization of the rate structure. 
Whether these cost savings can best be realized through mergers is problematic since there has been no railroad merger between close horizontal competitors since well before the passage of the act. 
In general, a large percentage of predicted efficiencies from railroad mergers have failed to materialize. 
More specifically, the efficiency estimates by the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific are riddled with errors and misconceptions. 
When a merger reduces competition, its approval requires a careful and accurate showing of efficiencies that could not be achieved without the merger. 
The applicants in this case simply did not provide the necessary showing. 

   Contrary to Mr. Melloan's assertion, the ICC's decision to reject the merger does not represent a slide toward re-regulation. 
Rather, by protecting existing competition, the decision has helped prevent such a slide.
