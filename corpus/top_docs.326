<HEAD>1989 A Record Year For Manatee Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record number of manatees, 160,
died in Florida waters in 1989, and state biologists fear recent
cold weather will kill more of the lumbering marine mammals.
   ``We're quite worried about the increasing number of deaths,''
said Bruce Ackerman, a researcher with the Department of Natural
Resources in St. Petersburg.
   Biologists estimate at least 1,200 manatees, an endangered
species, live in Florida. The population had been estimated at as
many as 10,000 a few decades ago.
   In 1989, 51 manatees died after hitting boats or barges, and
five were killed by other human-caused problems, such as
entanglement in fishing nets, according to the Department of
Natural Resources.
   In 1988, 133 manatees were found dead in Florida. Boats killed
43 manatees, then a record.
   Environmentalists and government biologists cite these
statistics when they promote boating speed limits and increased
protection of manatee habitat, issues state lawmakers could debate
this spring.
   Manatees frequent rivers, estuaries, canals and protected
coastal areas that also are magnets for the state's more than
710,000 registered motor boats.
   The average adult manatee is about 10 feet long and weighs 1,000
pounds, though some weigh three times that much. Gray and
slow-moving, they can be difficult for speedy boaters to spot, said
Lori Price, captive marine mammal specialist for the Department of
Natural Resources.
   ``I think very few of them (boaters) actually maliciously intend
to run down a manatee,'' she said. ``They're very difficult to
see.''

   A groggy volunteer crew of five gathered early New
Year's Day and raced to where a 500-pound sea cow had been found
with deep gashes from a boat propeller in its grayish-brown,
leathery back.
   But the West Indian manatee wasn't injured in the congested
Intracoastal Waterway, it was the Everglades. ``It shows you they
aren't safe anywhere,'' said Dr. Gregory Bossart, Miami Seaquarium
veterinarian and pathologist.
   Besides the unmistakable prop marks, the manatee had three
fractured ribs and a punctured lung. The injuries caused a bubble to
form inside the animal, leaving it floating helplessly.
   The manatee _ dubbed Marjory after Marjory Stoneman Douglas, a
protector of the Everglads _ has been recovering at the Seaquarium,
one of two marine parks _the other is Sea World in Orlando _ in
Florida that are authorized to rescue the protected animal.
   An estimated 1,200 of the prehistoric-looking creatures live in
Florida, based on aerial surveys. The docile, plant-eating
creatures, weighing more than 3,000 pounds and ranging from eight to
14 feet long, are found from northern South America to as far north
Virginia.
   They face a growing threat from Florida's development boom.
   A total of 133 manatee deaths were reported last year, including
a record 43 from being hit by boats; there were 39 boat-related
deaths in 1987. The 45 deaths so far this year exceeds the 1987
period. Through March, 15 deaths have been blamed on boats, and 23
carcasses were recovered last month alone.
   ``Our guess is that the numbers increased through the '60s and
'70s as there was more protection, but in the '80s they've held
about steady,'' said Dr. Bruce Ackerman, a state marine mammal
researcher. ``If that's the case, the fact that deaths are
increasing is of considerable concern.''
   Even if boat-related deaths were reduced, the manatee faces other
obstacles such as a low reproductive rate and diminishing habitat,
officials say.
   ``We're not that optimistic. ... Their ability to recover from
any kind of problem is limited, even if everything was perfect,''
Ackerman said.
   The rehabilitation of injured manatees is a painstaking process
that takes months. There is also the question of what awaits them
and babies born in captivity once they are returned to the wild.
   ``There's no problem with breeding in the wild. The problem we
have is habitat destruction,'' said J.P. Garner, assistant manager
of Homosassa Springs Park, where nine manatees are kept.
   Manatees rely on seagrass beds for food and have begun to
congregate around the warm-water discharges of power plants, where
boat traffic is often heavy.
   Patrick Rose, a marine mammal coordinator for the state
Department of Natural Resources, said Florida is focusing efforts on
tying manatee protection to county growth management plans. In
addition, there has been an extensive campaign to increase public
awareness about the creatures' plight.
   Singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffet gave a big boost to the manatee
cause eight years ago when he became chairman of the ``Save the
Manatee Club,'' which now boasts an international membership of
about 22,000.
   ``They have absolutely no ability to be aggressive,'' said Rose.
``People identify with them as the ultimate victim.''
   More than five months after being picked up, Marjory remains in
guarded but stable condition in a Seaquarium tank, Bossart said.
``She's feeling a lot better and is able to dive better.''
   Unlike many others of the gentle mammals, she still has a
fighting chance.

   The 1980s ended as a disaster for the West Indian
manatee.
   A record 174 of the huge, endangered mammals were found dead in
the United States last year, primarily because they were struck by
boats and barges in Florida waters, according to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's regional office in Atlanta.
   So far, 1990 is even worse for the sea cows.
   A record 74 manatee deaths were reported in January alone, most
of that due to the ``Christmas freeze'' that sent temperatures
plunging in north Florida.
   The service has been studying manatee deaths since 1974.
   The FWS said there were 510 deaths in those 15 years for which a
cause could be found. Of that number, 418 were attributed to the
animals being struck by boats or barges. Seventy-eight died when
they were crushed or drowned in floodgates of locks in canals and
50 were killed by humans. Some were shot, others caught in fishing
nets or lines.
   The population was estimated at 1,000 animals in 1980, and
aerial surveys of warm-water refuges in December found 1,200
individuals.
   The manatee has been around for 60 million years, evolving from
four-footed animals about the time the dinosaurs were on their last
legs.
   Because of the deaths in 1989, the state of Florida proposed
stringent new measures to help protect them.
   The measures include establishment of manatee protection plans
in those Florida counties that had the highest rates of
boat-manatee collisions last year. They also call for creation of
new manatee protection zones, where boats may travel only at
reduced speeds to help prevent collisions, and controlling
expansion of new boating facilities in areas inhabited by manatees.
   The state also is planning stepped up enforcement of all laws to
protect the species.
   The big, slow moving animals simply can't get out of the way of
fast boats. The animals, which can reach a length in excess of 10
feet and a weight of more than 1,000 pounds, lounge in rivers and
canals feeding on plants.
   Although they do move out into salt water, they spend most of
their lives in fresh water.
   They winter in warm water areas, such as springs, and have found
new habitat in the warm-water discharges of power plants as far
north as south Georgia.
   Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge on Florida's Gulf Coast
was established as a haven for manatees. Merritt Island National
Wildlife Refuge on the Atlantic Coast also has areas closed for
manatee protection.

<HEAD>Battle Lines Drawn in Florida Over Proposed Speed, Boating Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Boating in Florida has never been more
popular _ or more deadly _ as boats race at speeds up to 100 mph in
crowded waterways, threatening other boaters and wildlife like the
manatee.
   Now the state that has led the nation in recreational boating
deaths for the past two years is trying to establish a boating
speed limit, require more education and charge higher license fees
to bring the boating explosion under control.
   There are some 700,000 boat owners in the state _ seven times
the number of registered boaters in 1961. And that figure is
expected to double in the next 10 years, according to Florida
Marine Patrol estimates. Many boaters strongly oppose any new
regulations.
   The boating fatality rate in Florida is 2{ times the national
average, with the number of deaths soaring from 40 in 1986 to 102
in 1987 and 105 last year.
   The recent outcry for greater regulation was sparked by a
Memorial Day weekend collision along the Intercoastal Waterway in
Pinellas County that killed four teen-agers.
   Dr. William LaTorre, 48, was arrested Tuesday and charged with
four counts of manslaughter by culpable negligence after his sleek
35-foot boat collided with a 17-foot boat carrying five teen-agers
on the state's west coast near St. Petersburg.
   This week, the heads of state agencies will hold public hearings
in Orlando on a proposal by the Department of Natural Resources to
set a statewide speed limit of 30 mph, and 20 mph in 12 counties
heavily populated by manatees. The proposed speed limits are
scheduled to be voted on at a Sept. 14 Cabinet meeting.
   ``I think there's not a lot of sentiment right now for a
statewide (speed) zone,'' said Sally Munroe, an aide to Gov. Bob
Martinez.
   Marjorie Lamphear, education director of Save the Manatee Club
in Maitland, says the lower speed limits proposed for the 12
counties could help the manatee _ a large sea mammal also known as
sea cows.
   ``Manatees do recognize danger and try to get out of the way,''
she said. ``But between a speeding boat and a slow manatee, the
combination is not in favor of the manatee.''
   Between January and July, 103 manatees have been found dead,
with 37 deaths attributed to vessels, according the natural
resources department. During the same period last year, 29 of 93
manatee deaths were blamed on boaters. An estimated 1,200 of the
docile, plant-eating creatures, weighing more than 3,000 pounds and
ranging from eight to 14 feet long, live in Florida.
   ``We could lose 150 this year,'' Ms. Lamphear said. ``We need to
take drastic measures.''
   Next month, the natural resources department will ask the
governor and his Cabinet for mandatory education for boaters and
higher license fees to help pay for better enforcement of boating
laws, according to a draft report released last week by the agency.
   Some view the proposed regulations as an unnecessary intrusion.
   Last spring, the Legislature rejected a boating safety bill that
included a statewide speed limit.
   ``Why the heck should the government be sticking its nose in
something that should be individually involved?'' asked state Rep.
Jim King.
   Jim Robinson, state executive director of the Marine Industries
Association, doubts a 30 mph speed limit will lower the number of
deaths.
   Speed isn't the prime factor behind boating deaths, he
contended. They also were caused by lack of life jackets,
overloaded craft, carelessness and bad weather conditions, he said.
   Robinson called the proposed regulations an imposition on the
public, and warned, ``You better believe there's going to be a
battle.''
   But Col. Don Ellingsen, director of the Florida Marine Patrol,
said the regulations are needed because of the increasing
congestion on Florida waterways and the increase in speed.
   ``We don't believe that 30 mph will affect the vast majority of
boat owners,'' he said. ``We are trying to slow down the floating
rockets that go 80 to 100 mph.''

   A record 201 manatees died in Florida
waters this year, authorities said.
   At least 46 of the endangered sea cows were found dead in the
weeks following a three-day freeze last Christmas, and boat
collisions killed at least 46 more, said Bruce Ackerman, a marine
mammal researcher with the state Department of Natural Resources.
   A variety of factors contributed to the other deaths.
   Last year, 166 manatees were killed, up from 133 in 1988.
   State officials estimate there are 1,200 to 1,500 West Indian
manatees in Florida, down from an estimated 10,000 several decades
ago.
   The manatee has been around for 60 million years, evolving from
four-footed creatures about the time the dinosaurs were on their
last legs. The big, slow sea cows loll in warm, shallow areas in
oceans, rivers and canals to feed on underwater grass. They can be
longer than 10 feet and weigh more than 1,000 pounds and are unable
to avoid fast boats.

   Scientists, marine enforcement and
Florida businesses are pulling together to save the manatee from
boaters in a campaign keyed to the mammal's endangered status:
``Miss her now or miss her forever.''
   ``I think the slogan has really got a message,'' Vi Stewart of
the state Department of Natural Resources marine research
laboratory said Wednesday. ``It's very significant, but you've got
to think about it. It doesn't jump out and grab you like `where's
the beef?'''
   Marine experts estimate there are probably 1,200 West Indian
manatees left in the United States, down from as many as an
estimated 10,000 a few decades ago. Almost all are in Florida's
coastal waters.
   So far this year through September, 125 have died in Florida, 41
after being struck by boats or barges. Last year 113 deaths were
recorded.
   Aiming to slow this record-setting pace, a multimedia
advertising blitz is planned for the time of year when the gentle
giant is most vulnerable to boaters.
   As the temperature drops and the water cools, the lumbering sea
cows move into warmer waters near springs or thermal discharges of
power plants, thus increasing the risk of contact with boaters.
   ``The next six months is the most critical time for the
manatee,'' said Ralph Campbell, president of HLA Advertising and
Public Relations of Tampa, which donated work on the campaign and
came up with the slogan.
   The state Cabinet is recommending posting speed limits for boats
and the licensing of operators in a two-fold effort to reduce
boat-related deaths and to protect manatees.
   Florida has 711,000 registered boats. The state had 105
boating-related deaths last year.
   Gov. Bob Martinez and the Cabinet also voted Tuesday to require
13 counties where the manatees are concentrated to decide within 60
days whether to immpose countywide speed limits or adopt more
specific plans.

<TEXT>
   More than half of an unprecedented number of dead
manatees found in Florida waterways during the past nine days may
be victims of the Christmas cold snap, state officials said.
   The carcasses of 41 of the endangered marine mammals have been
discovered in the new year, the state's Department of Natural
Resources reported Monday.
   There were only 15 manatees found dead last year in all of
January, said Dr. Bruce Ackerman, marine mammal researcher at the
department's Florida Research Institute.
   ``It's the worst winter die-off we've had since we've been
counting,'' he said. ``They are literally coming in so fast we
can't keep our records up.''
   Ackerman's department has been documenting manatee deaths since
1974.
   Most of the carcasses have been found in the waters off Brevard
County. Violet Stewart, an institute spokeswoman, said 27 of the
gentle sea cows have been found there.
   ``It appears that the water over there got particularly cold,''
she said. ``We had some reports of water temperatures down into the
40s.''
   She said marine biologists estimate that 25 to 30 of the deaths
are cold-related, although precise causes will take time to
determine.
   ``They are finding that manatees died with this cold snap and
they sank,'' Ms. Stewart said. ``As they decay they rise to the
surface, so they are just now being recovered.''
   Ackerman said that since manatees are tropical, they have no
layer of blubber like seals and whales.
   ``They lose their ability to digest food and gradually become
more run-down,'' he said. ``When they get run-down, they lose the
ability to swim to a warmer place.''
   Last year, there were a record 165 manatee deaths. Biologists
estimate that Florida has only 1,200 of the endangered creatures
left.

<TEXT>
   Florida leads the nation in boating deaths
and unless strict speed limits are set and enforced, the situation
will soon become unmanageable, state officials said Wednesday.
   Department of Natural Resources officials opened three days of
public hearings on proposed new boating regulations with statistics
on Florida's exploding population of boaters and the casualties they
cause among humans and the endangered manatee.
   Boaters killed 105 people in the state last year _ 2.5 times the
national average _ and set a record in known manatee deaths with 29.
That record has already been surpassed this year with 37 manatee
deaths.
   The state has about 1 million registered and non-registered boats
and 3.5 million to 4 million people operating them, he said.
   ``It's very congested out there now, and with 100 boats being
added to the state total every day, we will double the number in the
next 10 years,'' said Don Ellingson, the DNR's director of the
Division of Law Enforcement. ``Unless we find ways to deal with that
congestion, we're going to have problems.''
   A key issue is expected to be the state's proposal of a statewide
speed limit of 30 mph on navigational channels in inland waterways.
This would drop to 20 mph in 12 counties with large numbers of the
sea cows.
   Except for a hodge-podge of local go-slow ordinances, there are
no boating speed limits now.
   Local and county elected officials and regulatory agency staffers
from Dade, Sarasota, Brevard and Suwannee counties expresed support
for the proposed rules, with some reservations and suggestions for
fine-tuning.
   The 12 counties being considered for manatee-protecting speed
limits are Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dade, Duval, Indian
River, Lee, Martin, Palm Beach, St. Lucie and Volusia.
   Commissioner Charles Williams of Suwannee County said that while
there was support for the DNR proposals, he suggested a maximum
speed limit of 40 mph because of the importance of water skiing in
the state. Skiers say it is impossible to carry out their maneuvers
at 30 mph.

IVORY COAST PLANS RESERVE FOR MANATEE

Plans are under way to create the first reserve in Africa for the manatee, the 
1-ton, 10-foot-long underwater cousin of the elephant. 
</P>
<P>
The manatees live in lagoons, rivers and coastal areas from Senegal to Angola. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve, on an inlet of the Bandama River near Abidjan, could be 
established as soon as March, according to Gbande Die, director of the adjacent 
Azagny National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first protected zone for manatees in Africa," Die said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows precisely how many manatees, also known as sea cows, there are in 
Abidjan, whose oceanfront lagoons make ideal habitats, but officials say the 
population is dwindling and estimate their numbers in the hundreds rather than 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"When we ask the peasants, they tell us they used to see lots of manatees and 
now they don't," Die said. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve will allow scientists to study manatees, which are found in 
Florida, the West Indies, the Amazon basin and West Africa, and whose behavior 
is little known. 
</P>
<P>
The experts will also determine how best to protect the animals, which are 
hunted for their beef-like flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Manatees are mammals and had a common ancestor with the elephant 75 million 
years ago. They have been a protected species since this former French colony 
became independent in 1960, but that has not stopped fishermen from poaching 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to enforce because the law is just a piece of paper," Die said. "And 
it's not just manatees, it's virtually all wild animals in Ivory Coast that 
suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the impetus for creating the reserve and protecting manatees arises 
from work here by James Powell, 34, an American naturalist from Wildlife 
Conservation International, an arm of the New York Zoological Society. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be as concerned about the manatees as we are about the rhinoceros," 
Powell said recently. "Manatees are big, impressive and unique. There is 
nothing else like them." 
</P>
<P>
He said that manatees, whose night-time squeals are believed to have sparked 
mermaid myths and who are associated in West Africa with a spirit called "Mamie 
Wata," are timid and gentle. 
</P>
<P>
The West African manatee, which has a wide muzzle and a long, bulbous trunk 
with two side flippers, looks a bit like a toothless walrus or a sea lion. 
</P>
<P>
"They are extremely strong but they don't seem to have an aggressive bone in 
their bodies," said Powell, who has trapped 18 manatees to fit them with radio 
transmitters so he can track their movements. He was able to work with them 
without tranquilizing them. 
</P>
<P>
He said that visitors have flocked to see a baby manatee he raised in a pen 
near a popular beach resort, but the animal died several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
He doubted that the dark-gray manatees, which are almost impossible to see in 
the murky lagoons, could become a tourist attraction, as they have in Florida. 
But Powell thinks man and manatee could learn to live side by side. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an important role in the estuarine environment," he said. "They are 
the only large herbivores, so they eat off the unwanted vegetation." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that if hunting were regulated manatees could provide an important 
source of protein. 
</P>
<P>
Powell and officials of Ivory Coast's Ministry of Water and Forests said the 
key to saving the manatee is learning more about them and educating fishermen 
about the perils of poaching. 
</P>
<P>
Kouadio Akoi, an Education Ministry officer who works with Powell, said that it 
is hard to persuade people to give up a source of food but that it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
"The fishermen tell us, 'First you say don't kill the tortoise, then you say 
don't kill the manatee -- what are we going to eat?' "But the disappearance of 
an animal would be a loss to everybody. We have a heritage we have to leave to 
our children."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Peasants Will Be Satisfied. </F>
Grain Procurement Prices Raised"] 
  [Text] In order to increase the material incentive for 
producers to increase volumes of grain sales to the state and in 
order to save on the expenditure of hard currency funds on the 
acquisition of grain from abroad, and also taking into account 
the higher costs of material and technical resources and energy 
sources used on the farms, the growth of inflation, and the 
higher prices on the world market, the Azerbaijan Cabinet of 
Ministers considered it expedient to adopt the proposals of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, the State Grain Products Company, and 
the Ministry of Economics to raise prices of grain from internal 
reserves. 
  As an AZERTADZH correspondent was told in the Ministry of 
Agriculture, the average selling price of one tonne of grain 
from the 1994 crop sold to the state is 50,000 manats, a 
sevenfold increase over last year's prices. Taking into account 
the fact that priority in raising procurement prices has been 
given to hard and strong strains of wheat, the following prices 
have been set: for one tonne of hard wheat meeting requirements 
of class I--65,000 manats, of class II--62,000 manats, and of 
class III--55,000 manats; for strong and soft strains, 
regardless of class--48,000-53,000 manats; for one tonne of 
barley--46,000 manats, of corn--50,000 manats, and of peas for 
human consumption--94,000 manats. 
  The ministry has prepared additional recommendations in 
order 
to increase the material incentive for machine operators and 
other workers to harvest the grain at optimal times and without 
losses. It is stipulated that each combine operator 
participating in the harvest may be issued as wages 50 manats 
and 10 kilograms of grain, and their assistants, 35 manats and 7 
kilograms of grain for each tonne harvested; truck drivers are 
to be issued, in addition to their wages, one kilogram of grain 
for each tonne that is transported. Additionally, combine 
operators are to be paid bonuses in the amount of 1,500-2,500 
manats, depending on the volume of grain reaped during the 
season. 
  Ministry of Agriculture workers think that raising grain 
procurement prices will have a positive effect on strengthening 
the economies of the farms, will increase the material incentive 
for workers, and will make it possible to achieve an increase in 
the volumes of grain sold to the state.

<F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Manats Float"] </F>
  [Text] Baku -- The manat -- the national monetary unit of 
Azerbaijan -- has had a difficult time. It is losing value not 
by the day but by the hour. To cover up this patent devaluation 
the National Bank of Azerbaijan periodically sets a new manat 
rate against the currencies of the former Union republics. 
  The initial rate was confusing -- one manat to 10 Russian 
rubles [R]. Why not 20? Commercial bank specialists have 
reason to call a "ceiling" -- this arbitrarily established rate 
has not been borne out by any exchange trading. So what 
prompted the new rate of one to 14? 
  As a rule, attempts to discern the economic laws on which 
the 
exchange rate is based prove pointless. 
  On the currency black market -- the famous "Molokanka" (from 
the name of a pleasant little square in downtown Baku) -- people 
are trading at a rate of R1,000 to 275 manats, paying no 
attention to the bankers' sluggishness. The people on the 
square do not rule out the possibility that in a month or so a 
ruble could be worth the same as a manat. 
  Hyperinflation has long been part and parcel of the 
Azerbaijani economy, forcing the manat into the most improbable 
contortions. This was to be expected: Deformations in the 
economy seem to happen on their own, and the manat has been left 
to its own devices, as if orphaned. Despite the fact that state 
property has not been privatized and the mechanism of market 
relations has not been fully realized, the new manat has been 
allowed to float. No currency can function normally without a 
weight of goods to back it -- and home-produced goods at that. 
Having failed to make deliveries of output and goods outside 
the republic under the clearing system, enterprises have been 
deprived of reciprocal shipments worth 6 billion manats. Half 
of last year's cotton and grape crops were not harvested. 
Meanwhile 80 percent of foodstuffs are bought on the side for 
foreign currency -- weak petrodollars. And these are getting 
fewer and further between, since oil extraction in the republic 
has fallen by 800,000 tonnes. 
  There is no harm in admitting that home-grown businessmen 
are 
making a good living from the people's baleful position. The 
state owes 22 billion manats in wages and pensions, while 
ministries, departments, enterprises, and commercial structures 
are keeping R27 billion that they owe to others in Russian bank 
accounts, earning fabulous rates of interest. 
  President Heydar Aliyev has demanded that the leaders of 
debtor organizations repatriate forthwith their exported capital 
or the products that have been bought with it. Meanwhile 
specialists believe that the hidden billions are unlikely to 
save the Azerbaijani economy. The following weighty argument is 
also quoted: Transactions with Russian banks are not effective 
[ne deystvuyut], and the Central Bank of Russia is hardly likely 
to agree to such operations, recalling Azerbaijan's large debts. 
  Has not the time come to print larger-denomination manats? 
Those in circulation cannot keep up with galloping prices. The 
consignment of manats expected to arrive from France will be 
enough to pay the wage and pension backlog. 
  And the manat continues to float.

  [Text] Baku, 4 May (AZERTAC)--Manat, Azeri national 
monetary unit seems to undergo the same fate as the Ukrainian 
Karbovanets. The manats exchange rate against the U.S. dollar 
has gone down by 90 per cent and against the Russian ruble by 
2.5 times correspondingly. Thus, today one U.S. dollar costs 
1000 manats and the Russian ruble 0.6 manats. The Azeri 
currency's rapid downfall provoked a feverish mood in the 
country. At Baku's parallel market on Molokanka square, the 
exchange rate of the foreign currency is being updated up to 
three times a day. 
  However, official exchange rates have not been adapted yet. 
According to the information available, the Azeri national bank 
pays 182.5 manats per dollar and 1 manat per 10 Russian rubles. 
That is why the center of currency transactions has moved from 
banking offices at the parallel market. According to 
specialists view, this is one more factor provoking the 
disastrous downfall of the local currency. 
  Azeri experts consider the principal reason of the present 
economic situation the absence of a flexible monetary policy in 
Azerbaijan. Some experts explain this situation by the small 
amount of foreign currency that is being earned by Azerbaijan 
since the Republic's industry has virtually stopped working. 
Moreover, the manat has not become an independent currency and 
its condition depends on fluctuation of rate of exchange of the 
Russian ruble as the national bank has not determined the manats 
real value so far. One of the local televisions observers has 
expressed a very original opinion concerning this situation. He 
explained it by the reason that governmental officers take their 
bribes in freely convertible currency only. However, he may 
guess all too near: Baku newspapers give many examples of this 
kind. 
  Though predictions are dismal -- experts think that dollars 
rate will increase in about 40 per cent every month -- the 
Republic is trying to find the way out from this crisis. 
Abolition of the law of limitation on export of strategic goods 
will undoubtedly provide more constant flow of currency. The 
experts think that the situation might be improved by creation 
of currency exchange offices where monetary transactions will be 
done in accordance with the reasonable rates of currency. The 
experts also say that development of the local industry and 
creation of normal conditions for small enterprises will be more 
effective in this case. 
  However, present monetary and credit crisis resulted in 
retirement of administration of the national bank. Through the 
ever falling manats exchange rate more people live below the 
poverty line. Now 60 per cent of the republics population -- 
about 4 million people -- live in poverty. According to one of 
Baku's newspapers, each of the poor needs 12,600 manats monthly, 
if not to take inflation into consideration, in order to satisfy 
the minimum needs. This amount of money is 70 and 170 per cent 
as much as it was necessary in March and January this year. 
According to Ministry of Labour and Social Security, one 
citizen needs 16 thousand manats for showing a sign of life, it 
is a so-called physiological minimum. 
  Meanwhile, a minimum salary of 900 manats is enough to buy 
half a kilogram of meat. So an average citizen of the Republic 
has to display miracles of resourcefulness in order not to kick 
the bucket.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Draft State Budget Sent to Parliament </F>
for Approval"] 
  [Text] According to the republic's deputy minister of 
finance, Fikret Yusifov, the income part of the budget assumes 
revenue of 138.4746 billion manats, and the expense 
part--181.3717 billion manats. Thus, the budget will have a 
deficit of 42.8971 billion manats. 
  F. Yusifov noted that such a large deficit is the result of 
a 
decline in the level of production, which has dropped 
several-fold as compared to 1992. In order to cover the deficit, 
the following steps are being planned, in particular: 
implementation of the state privatization program, which will 
help to earn 5 billion manats; changing prices for alcoholic 
beverages, which should bring 1.3 billion into the budget; 
raising prices for fuel and energy and bread; introducing 
value-added tax on imported goods, which will bring in 4.6 
billion over the remaining seven months; and so on. The deputy 
minister of finance also emphasized that raising the minimum 
wage from 900 to 2,000 manats is in the works, which will 
require additional budget expenditures. This difference is 
expected to be covered by raising retail prices on gasoline and 
the recently approved tax in the amount equal to two minimum 
wages on each square meter of space occupied by commercial trade 
and public catering entities. F. Yusifov said, however, that 
raising the minimum wage will only lead to another jump in 
market prices and in the final count an even greater decline in 
the population's living standard. As a KHABAR-SERVICE 
correspondent learned from competent sources in the republic 
government, three options for raising gasoline prices are now 
under consideration: 40, 50, and 60 manats per liter. Most 
likely the middle figure will be chosen, which will bring into 
the budget an additional 25-30 billion manats, but still will 
not be enough to raise the minimum wage.

  [Text] Baku, 2 May (TURAN)--Azerbaijan's Ministry of 
Economy handed reviewed prognosis of socio-economic development 
for 1994 to the Ministry of Finance. 
  According to the Milli Majlis, the Ministry of Finance has 
to 
take into account this prognosis when finishing off the work 
over the budget draft. 
  According to prognoses, in 1994 the inflation will total 600 
per cent. In the first variant of the prognoses this figure was 
240 per cent. 
  A representative of the Ministry of Finance told TURAN that 
their employees don't agree to the forecasted level of inflation 
since it does not correspond to real economical situation. Over 
the first quarter of 1994 the inflation totalled 300 percent and 
the production reduced by 25 per cent. 
  The Ministry of Economy forecasted the volume of gross 
national product 910 billion manats and national income 677 
billion manats. In the first variant these figures were 313 and 
272 billion manats, relatively.

<F P=106> [Arif Useynov report: "Azerbaijan: Panic on the Black </F>
Market"] 
  [Text] Baku -- It would appear that the situation that had 
been long predicted has become a reality: The U.S. dollar has 
shot up to 1,000 manats on the black market. Thus the 
population is 20 percent poorer, since the day before the same 
dollar could be bought for 800 manats. The same has happened 
with the exchange rate of the Russian ruble -- on the black 
market it is expressed in terms of the dollar rate and has 
reached 1 manat to 2 rubles. The manat is clearly dropping away. 
  Correspondingly, prices of basic necessities also shot up, 
getting beyond the reach of the majority of the population. The 
opposition press believes that what is happening on the currency 
market is the consequence of serious economic upheavals. In 
particular, the opinion is being expressed that the financial 
magnates who manipulate black market transactions are ready to 
blow the situation in the republic apart from within. It is not 
yet clear according to what scenario events will develop. The 
population has been agitated by the explosion of prices on the 
market -- a minimum salary today will only buy 1.5 kg of beef.

<LEADPARA>  More manatees died in Florida from human causes in 1991 than any previous
year, despite fewer boats, more speed limits and preservation spending of
$1,800 per endangered animal. Through last week, 168 of the slow-moving
mammals also known as sea cows were found dead, according to the state
Department of Natural Resources. Those included 52 killed in collisions with
boats and 14 from other human-related causes such as being trapped in
floodgates. The 66 human-related deaths topped the old record of 58 in 1989.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The cooling pond is part of a system that cools the nuclear reactor through
intermediate piping loops, so the incidents didn't disrupt plant operations
and the pond water isn't radioactive.;    The manatee was in good condition
Wednesday while utility employees tried to find a way to cage and move it.;   
"We think it's pretty unusual that this manatee did what it did," said Ray
Golden, spokesman for Florida Power &amp; Light Co. He said employees have been
feeding the 9-foot sea mammal 24 heads of lettuce a day since it showed up in
the pond Friday.;    Sea World biologists plan to gradually introduce a cage
into the pond, and when the manatee gets used to it, trap it, possibly by
Monday. They will take the animal for a checkup and release it.;    The
1,500-foot pipeline is the only route into the pond. Three concrete slabs
arranged over the sea opening reduce the speed of the water flowing into the
intake, but two have large holes. The utility plans to begin replacing the
slabs next month at a cost of $22 million, Golden said.  </TEXT>

   Flooding caused by several days of heavy
rainfall led to the evacuation of about 1,000 people, closed
schools and forced police to patrol in garbage trucks today,
authorities said.
   About 1,000 people were evacuated from trailer parks and
low-lying areas in eastern Manatee County, the Florida National
Guard said.
   The rainfall was the heaviest since Hurricane Elena in 1985, but
no injuries were reported. One community reported 13 inches of
rainfall.
   Manatee County supervisors and the Bradenton city council met in
emergency session this morning to seek ways to combat flooding
along the Manatee and Little Manatee rivers.
   Police in Palmetto, across the Manatee River from Bradenton,
were forced to abandon their patrol cars and travel in garbage
trucks.
   Manatee High in Bradenton and several other schools were
flooded, said county school Superintendent Gene Witt; the school
board called off classes across the county.
   ``The roads are heavily flooded and we're having sewage problems
with water backing up into the schools,'' he said. ``In the last 25
years I haven't seen anything of this magnitude.''
   Parts of Manatee County, just south of Tampa, have received up
to 10 inches of rain in the last two days, Witt said; four more
inches could fall today, forecasters predicted.
   Up the coast from Bradenton, Yankeetown reported 13 inches of
rain.
   ``All the rivers around here are over their banks,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Eric Hermann in the Yankeetown station.
``There's a lot of street flooding and stuff.''
   In northern Florida, officials in Clay County began to evacuate
families along swollen Black Creek, said Chief Pete Cummings of the
Clay County Public Safety Department.
   Deputies went house-to-house in a boat just after daybreak
today, offering assistance to families and making sure they could
get out, said Cummings.

  [Text] Baku (April 9) TURAN -- It was announced yesterday 
in the Milli Majlis that in 1993 the State's budget deficit 
totalled 25.1 billion manats, despite the fact that it was not 
supposed to reach 11.7 billion manats. 
  Fikret Yusifov, Deputy Minister of Finance, stated that the 
reason for the high deficit is due to the negative development 
in the economy, the fall in productivity and heightened 
financial crisis. 
  The deputies from the PFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan], 
the 
Musavat party and the National Independence Party urged that the 
government accelerate activities in order to curb the inflation 
and balance prices in the country with the low salaries. 
Discussions about the deficit are to continue next week.

  [Text] Baku, 26 May (AZERTAC)--Today, after a two-day 
debate, the parliament of Azerbaijan passed the Republic budget 
for 1994 year with a deficit of 23.6 per cent. The MPs

  According to the passed budget, the Republic revenue will 
come to 138.5 billion manats and expenditure--181.4 billion 
manats this year. The Ministry of Finance proposes to cover a 
deficit of 43 billion manats by releasing domestic loan, 
increasing tax dues as well as by means of privatization, draft 
of which was approved by the president in April, however was not 
been passed by the parliament so far.

  [Text] Baku, June 20 (TURAN) -- Gudrat Abdulsalimzade, head 
of the Committee for Property told at today's press-conference 
that the Committee submitted to the Milli Mejlis new draft of 
privatization program. 
  The new draft provides increase of privatisation share of 
each civilian of the republic to 120,000 manats. "It has been 
done in connection with the last overestimation of the 
privatised property", said Abdulsalimzade. 
  According to the program 8,768 enterprises and objects are 
scheduled to be privatized in 1994. It makes 14.8 percent of 
all enterprises and objects of the republic, covers 5 percent of 
all funds and 3.1 percent of all employees working in the state 
section. 
  Expenses for privatisations will total 400 million manats in 
1994, said the Head of the Committee. According to him, "small" 
privatization, i.e. privatization of enterprises totalling no 
more than 200 people, is to complete in 1995. Middle and part 
of large enterprises will be privatized during 1996-1998. 
  Answering journalists question concerning the delay in the 
adoption of the program, even after it was signed by President, 
Abdulsalimzade said that there are people in the highest 
legislative body and in the ministries and among the leaders of 
enterprises, opposing the privatization program. 
  The high rank employee of the Committee for Property told 
TURAN that there are two approaches to this problem in the 
highest circles. "The part of them want to organise wholesale 
of state property, the others are opposed [to] privatization at 
all, referring to the war. "Privatization will not take place 
until they come to common decision", said the employee. 
  Law for privatization was adopted in Azerbaijan on January 
7, 
1993. Up to today only 5,000 taximotors [taxicabs] are 
privatized in the country.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Grigoriy Kolodin: "The Manat Has </F>
Prompted Respect for...the Ruble"] 
  [Text] Turkmenia -- It has been nearly five months since 
the introduction of the national currency in Turkmenia -- the 
manat. That is certainly long enough to consider the initial 
results of the circulation of the new money and what effect this 
unavoidable step has had on the country's economy. It was 
indeed unavoidable, although banknotes and coins manufactured 
beforehand in Britain, were ready and waiting, but the 
government thought that at that time Turkmenia was not yet fully 
prepared for the switch to its own currency. It was only when 
it became obvious that the Russian authorities were planning to 
force their CIS neighbors out of the ruble zone that Turkmenia 
accelerated the introduction of the manat. 
  November was a month of euphoria and...empty pocketbooks. 
The exchange of citizens' savings was carried out in such a way 
as to drastically reduce the money supply. However, even with a 
mere handful of coins in his pocket, a person felt quite 
solvent. For 5 kopeks (that is what people here habitually call 
the small change -- the tenge) you could buy the latest 
newspaper or eat a bread roll, and for 20 you could buy a loaf 
or stick of wheaten bread. With 2 chervonets, you could buy 10 
eggs, some green vegetables, and a couple of kilograms of 
apples. Potatoes cost 1 manat, and, just as in the good old 
days of stagnation, traders would stick cardboard price tickets 
into their piles of late melons, saying "1 melon -- 1 ruble." 
And although, after the first pay packets were issued in the 
new money, the Turkmens learned to count their small change in a 
new way, for an average wage of 400 manats you could not only 
feed yourself, but also buy, say, a pair of Italian shoes for 
110 manats or a washing machine for 120 manats. 
  Alas, November and December, when the family budget was 
"tight" but you could fill a bag with food products for a small 
sum, are remembered here today as months of plenty and days of 
bright hopes which, unfortunately, are not yet fated to become 
reality. In Turkmenia it is still not the custom to publish 
information on the inflation rate or to calculate the cost of 
the consumer basket, but every inhabitant of the Republic can 
see for himself every day how life is growing increasingly 
expensive. Meat prices in the bazaars have risen from 5 to 50 
manats a kilogram, the cost of fruit and vegetables has also 
gone up, for the third month in succession the shelves of stores 
selling industrial products are practically empty, and in the 
few commercial stores the prices are certainly not suited to 
people who are living only on a wage. And without the 
continuing government subsidies on flour and bread for the 
population, so that bread still costs 20-30 tenge, without the 
free provision of electricity, natural gas, and water and the 
very low cost of housing, of sending children to preschool 
institutions, and of travel on public transport, things would be 
very tight indeed for the Turkmens. 
  It is certainly not the manat as such that is to blame for 
the fact that the Republic, which in all previous years had a 
deficit-free budget, is today spending more than it receives. 
The financial hole in the state's pocket was caused by the huge 
debts of the former brothers in the Union for natural gas 
supplied in the past year. It is no joking matter that 
Turkmenia is owed $1.5 billion by Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, 
and the other CIS countries -- a shortfall of nearly 380 
"greenbacks" for every local inhabitant. The main debtors -- 
Ukraine and Georgia -- asked for their last year's debt of $700 
million and $200 million respectively to be classified as a 
Turkmen Government loan. Their wishes were accommodated, but 
the first two months of this year elapsed without either Ukraine 
or Georgia keeping its promise -- to pay for gas every 10 days. 
It was necessary to resort to extreme measures and close the 
valves on the pipelines to Ukraine. But apparently the 
Ukrainian authorities are today more worried about the purely 
internal political struggle and the disastrous decline of their 
own economy. 
  President Saparmurad Niyazov and his team are intensively 
seeking a way out of the crisis situation. Preparations have 
been stepped up for the implementation if the plan for a gas 
pipeline which will convey Turkmen natural fuel via Iran and 
Turkey to Europe. The possibility of pumping gas through 
Afghanistan to Pakistan is being examined. A major reform of 
the agrarian sector is under way: More than 50,000 hectares of 
formerly unused land has been handed over to private ownership. 
  But for the moment the manat remains a sideshoot of the 
dollar and the ruble. Its real rate is falling rapidly. Having 
ostensibly been set as equivalent to 50 cents and 500 Russian 
rubles in November, today it only runs to 1 cent and 20 rubles. 
The lack of Russian currency in the banks has been a severe blow 
to state and business structures, which are 80 percent "tied" to 
Russia. Contracts are being broken, former links are being 
lost, and business circles can be heard increasingly frequently 
dreaming: "If only we were back in the ruble area! We cannot 
survive without Russia yet..." 
  As for survival, this is, of course, a slight exaggeration. 
But common sense and the example of Belorusia [Belarus] 
suggests that it is not a question of what picture there is on 
the banknotes, but of preventing them from degenerating into 
pretty colored candy wrappers.

   BAKU, AZERBAIJAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AZERBAIJAN'S Brezhnev era KGB and communist party chief, Mr Heidar Aliyev,
made a remarkable political comeback yesterday, winning election as chairman
of the former Soviet republic's parliament.
The election makes Mr Aliyev, 70, nominally the second most powerful leader
to Azerbaijan President Abulfaz Elchibey.
But diplomats and other foreign observers in Baku, the capital, believe that
the wily Mr Aliyev has carved himself out a significant chunk of Mr
Elchibey's power and that new elections are likely. Given the present
despondent political mood, Mr Aliyev probably would be Azerbaijan's
strongest presidential candidate.
The political and economic deterioration was demonstrated when Baku
newspapers yesterday announced that Mr Elchibey had postponed complete
introduction of Azerbaijan's new currency, the manat.
The government, which began circulating the manat on June 2, had announced
that the rouble would be invalidated on June 15, but the move now has been
delayed at least until July 1. 'We need to wait until the situation
stabilises. As soon as that happens, the reforms will take place,' said Mr
Elman Rustamov, deputy chairman of the ministry of foreign economic
activity.
On Monday the US embassy recommended that American nationals leave the
country, and many foreign businessmen, including oil company employees, have
departed on flights to Istanbul and Moscow.
It was not clear whether Azerbaijan's political upheaval was over. Mr
Aliyev's comeback was forewarned a week ago, when rebel troops seized
Azerbaijan's second city, Gyanja, and demanded Mr Elchibey's resignation.
Though the troops, led by a charismatic businessman, Mr Surat Huseynov, have
voiced their support for Mr Aliyev, they now have taken control of up to
half the Caspian Sea nation, and are within 70 miles of Baku.
Mr Elchibey, whose popularity has steadily waned since he came to power
about a year ago, has threatened to use force to defend his government. But
it is unclear how much loyalty he still enjoys in the military, or among the
Azeri population of 7m.
The key factor in Mr Elchibey's loss of popularity have been the lack of
economic improvements and a string of military defeats in the war in the
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. On Monday night ethnic Armenians from
Nagorno-Karabakh finally agreed to a brokered settlement. But at the same
time ethnic Armenian troops appeared to be encircling yet another important
city in the region, Agdam, which actually lies outside Nagorno-Karabakh.
The continued fighting was bound to put new pressure on Mr Elchibey, and
give Mr Aliyev a stronger hand ultimately to topple him.

Until a few years ago, there were few good ones. But now environmentalism for

from.;   Here are four that you can probably find in a local store, with

<TEXT>     (check)  "The Great Kapok Tree: A Tale of the Amazon Rain Forest" by Lynne
Cherry (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1990; $14.95; color illustrations). One of
the nicest eco-story books for young children, beautifully illustrated.
Sample: "The tops of the trees in the rain forest are called the canopy. The
canopy is a sunny place that touches the sky. The animals that live there like
lots of light. Colorful parrots fly from tree to tree. Monkeys leap from
branch to branch. . . . In this steamy environment, the great Kapok tree
shoots up through the forest and emerges above the canopy. This is the story
of a community of animals that live in one such tree in the rain forest.";  
(check)  "How Nature Works: 100 Ways Parents and Kids Can Share the Secrets of
Nature" by David Burnie (Reader's Digest, 1991; $24). Profusely illustrated
with color photos, experiments and diagrams. Not as simple or accessible as it
first appears, but still the best "Nature 101" book for older kids and adults
we've seen. Sample: "Over 260 million years ago, turtles and tortoises evolved
-- long before their larger relatives, the dinosaurs. The armor-plating of
these fascinating animals protects them against most predators when adults,
but they are vulnerable when young because they reproduce by laying eggs.
Particularly threatened are the sea-going turtles that lay their eggs at night
on sandy beaches. . . . Some species are now seriously endangered.";   (check)
 "Kid Heroes of the Environment: Simple Things Real Kids Are Doing to Save the
Earth" by the EarthWorks Group (EarthWorks Press, 1991, $4.95; black and white
illustrations). Includes stories about kids all over the country, with
step-by-step instructions and resources. Sample: "When Lyle Solla-Yates was in
first grade, his favorite animals were manatees -- rare mammals also known as
"sea cows" that live off the coast of Florida. One day Lyle read a report in
the newspaper about a manatee that had been injured by a motor boat. It made
him angry. 'I really wanted to do something to help the manatees,' he says. So
in 1989, he started a group called Pals of Wildlife to raise money to help
save them. His group raised hundreds of dollars and has donated the money to
various environmental organizations. Lyle says: 'We've gotten people to see
they can change things. And we learned that helping the environment can be
fun!' ";   (check)  "My First Green Book: A Life-Size Guide to Caring for Our
Environment" (Dorling-Kindersley, 1991; $12). English book whose main
attraction is its attractive design and beautiful color photographs. Includes
projects and basic information. Sample: "One of the main sources of everyday
waste is packaging. Packaging can be useful. It protects goods and may provide
useful information about them. But many things come in layers and layers of
unnecessary paper, plastic and cardboard. Usually, the more expensive a
product is, the more layers of wasteful packaging it has. The best way to
reduce waste is to avoid buying anything that is over-packaged. Here you can
see the amount of packaging used for a takeout meal for one child."  </TEXT>

<F P=106> [Republic of Azerbaijan presidential edict: "Measures To </F>
Increase Social Protection of the Population and Financial 
Stabilization of the Economy"] 
  [Text] The increase in inflation and the decline in 
production have led in recent times to a lowering of the living 
standard of society and have exerted a negative influence on the 
financial state of the republic. This has been connected to a 
decisive extent with the inefficient use of the financial and 
credit resources of public enterprises and organizations, the 
unjustified increase in their crossover into nonstate 
structures, and the absence of precise mechanisms of the pursuit 
of a price policy and the regulation of wages and the currency 
market. All this is creating difficulties for the implementation 
of the program of market transformations and bringing about a 
growth of socioeconomic tension. 
  To increase social protection of the population and ensure 
financial stabilization of the economy I resolve: 
  1. To establish as of 1 June 1994 minimum remuneration at 
2,000 manat a month. 
  2. To appoint as of 1 June 1994 for social and nonworking 
retirees, students of day courses at higher educational 
institutions, and trainees of technical schools and 
vocational-technical schools monetary compensation amounting to 
1,500 manat, and for families with a per capita monthly income 
of less than the minimum wage times two, monetary compensation 
amounting to 750 manat a month per child 16 years of age and 
under. These sums of compensation shall be paid from the 
resources of the republic budget. 
  To consider lapsed in this connection the Republic of 
Azerbaijan presidential edict of 22 November 1993 "Payment of 
Compensation to Nonworking Retirees" and clause two of Republic 
of Azerbaijan presidential edict of 22 November 1993 
"Supplementary Measures in the Field of Regulation of the Price 
of Bread and Bakery Products and Increased Social Protection for 
the Needy Strata of the Populace." 
  3. That the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers 
shall 
implement the following system of anti-inflation measures to 
ensure financial stabilization in the economy: 
  as of 16 June 1994, increase the prices of energy and bread 
and hence forward review them not less than quarterly with 
regard to the rate of inflation; 
  within three days' time, make the corresponding changes, 
based on coordinated proposals of the Ministry of Finance and 
the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Populace, to 
the uniform wage scale for workers and employees to prevent the 
formation of an appreciable gap between the remuneration of 
employees of the low-income and high-income categories; 
  prior to the end of 1994, suspend the construction of 
facilities financed from funds of the republic budget, except 
for projects of the current year that are close to completion, 
and adopt measures to ensure the safe preservation of these 
facilities; 
  reverse the decisions it adopted earlier on public 
enterprises being granted soft loans; 
  in interaction with the banks, adopt measures to ensure the 
public enterprises' repayment of credit within the established 
timeframe; 
  within two weeks' time, present proposals for the 
reorganization of the structure of the central organs of state 
administration in the direction of a reduction in their numbers 
and also a downsizing of staff and administrative-managerial 
costs, thanks to a reduction in the number of official motor 
vehicles included; 
  within 10 days' time, devise rules for the allocation of the 
resources of public enterprises and organizations on charitable 
purposes and introduce a precise mechanism of supervision to 
ensure that these resources be used as specifically intended; 
  within 10 days' time, confirm the maximum rate of use of the 
profits of public enterprises and organizations for wages; 
  in the necessary quantity to partially cover the budget 
deficit, provide for the manufacture and sale of government 
securities; 
  within a month's time, prepare and present proposals 
concerning a transition from the system of tax and nontax 
privileges for particular categories of individuals and legal 
entities to a system of monetary compensation for the socially 
unprotected strata of the populace; 
  ensure strict compliance with legislation on the 
registration 
and issue of a certificate to higher and secondary specialized 
educational institutions and adopt the necessary measures aimed 
at a reduction in the admittance of trainees to 
vocational-technical schools and of students to evening and 
correspondence departments of higher educational institutions 
funded from the state budget; 
  within a month's time, devise and present for consideration 
by the president of the Republic of Azerbaijan a concept for 
transition to insurance medicine and also proposals pertaining 
to its legal support. 
  4. That the Republic of Azerbaijan Ministry of Economics and 
the State Committee for Antitrust Policy and the Support of 
Enterprise shall intensify supervision of the formation of 
prices at public enterprises that are monopolies and 
systematically present to the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of 
Ministers information on enterprises permitting a deviation from 
the market prices of the products (services) they manufacture 
(provide). 
  That the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers shall 
adopt stringent measures against enterprise executives 
permitting such a deviation. 
  5. That the Republic of Azerbaijan Ministry of Finance 
shall: 
  within a month's time conduct an audit of the resources of 
public enterprises and organizations diverted into founder's and 
other contributions to the nonstate sector of the economy. 
  That the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers shall 
provide for the adoption of specific measures for the more 
efficient use of these resources; 
  provide for the precise delineation of the republic and 
local 
budgets, broadening the independence of the local budgets with 
regard to the fuller use of levers of their formation; 
  with regard to inflation review quarterly in conjunction 
with 
the Main State Tax Inspectorate of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
the treasury tax receipt targets. 
  6. To propose that the National Bank of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan: 
  tighten the reserve requirements in respect to 
joint-stock-commercial and commercial banks and, with regard to 
the rate of growth of inflation, review quarterly the discount 
rate on centralized credit resources; 
  disallow the practice of the mutual off-setting of arrears 
between enterprises and organizations; 
  implement measures to terminate lending to enterprises and 
organizations with foreign currency assets; 
  adopt all measures to ensure the stabilization of the 
exchange rate of the manat and the regular operation of the Baku 
Interbank Currency Exchange. For this purpose authorize the 
National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan, following 
consultation with the president of the Republic of Azerbaijan, 
to use resources of the Stabilization Fund for restrained 
intervention in the interbank currency market; 
  provide in conjunction with the joint-stock-commercial 
agro-industrial and industrial-investment banks for their 
transition as of 1 July 1994 to a system of correspondent 
accounts to prevent the issue of credit not backed by resources; 
  adopt in conjunction with the Republic of Azerbaijan 
Ministry 
of Economics, the Republic of Azerbaijan Ministry of Finance, 
and the Republic of Azerbaijan Main State Tax Inspectorate 
measures to stabilize monetary circulation and reduce money 
issue by means of the establishment of a stimulatory deposit 
interest rate and regulation of the activity of the commercial 
sector in the sphere of monetary circulation. 
  7. For an increase in the efficiency of the use of public 
financial resources to propose that public enterprises and 
organizations switch to full credit-payment and cash service in 
joint-stock-commercial banks whose controlling block of shares 
is publicly owned. That the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of 
Ministers shall implement urgent measures in this sphere. 
  8. To propose that the Republic of Azerbaijan National 
Assembly speed up the confirmation of the guidelines of the 
credit policy of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 1994 and the 
official program of privatization as an important means of 
economic and financial stabilization and the adoption of a law 
on property and other legislative instruments ensuring a legal 
basis for the transition to a market economy. 
  9. To commission the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of 
Ministers and the Republic of Azerbaijan National Bank with 
presenting the Republic of Azerbaijan president with information 
monthly on execution of this edict. 
  [Signed] Geydar Aliyev, Republic of Azerbaijan president 
  Baku, 15 June 1994

Donna Castle's fourth-graders in Milford, Pa., have adopted an injured 
red-tailed hawk named the Red Baroness. Nine-year-old Stephen Raba thinks of 
the hawk as his own. 
</P>
<P>
"He talks about it all the time, about his bird. He takes it personally," said 
his mother, Lynne Raba. "When some of the class went to see it, he was adamant 
that he had to go, that it was so important. It's something that he takes a lot 
of pride in." 
</P>
<P>
The students at Dingman Delaware Elementary School recycled $25 worth of 
aluminum cans to adopt the bird for one month at a nearby rehabilitation center 
for injured and orphaned birds of prey. The children are hoping they can keep 
the Red Baroness on the mend until she's ready to be released into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, financial foster parents are being sought for a manatee in Florida, 
baby puffins off the coast of Maine and California gray whales in the Pacific 
Ocean. A Pennsylvania trout stream can be adopted for an investment of labor, 
as can a Texas beach and an Arkansas highway. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, environmental groups are offering "adoption" plans for wild 
birds and animals, their habitats and open spaces as a way to raise money 
anywhere nature is in trouble. The groups say more and more people are adopting 
the wild through contributions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hands-On' Effort 
</P>
<P>
"It's hands-on. It's strong and it's powerful," says Pat Noonan of the 
Conservation Fund in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental movement is trying to reach out in creative ways to enlist 
volunteer support and involvement, and adopt-a-tree and adopt-a-whale are 
things people can identify with." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Bates of the Whale Center in Oakland, Calif., one of several 
organizations offering whales for adoption, says: "It's a gimmick, a hook, 
because everybody is hurting, everybody needs money. After you donate to a 
couple of organizations, chances are your mailbox is going to be inundated, so 
you want to be the one piece of mail folks will not throw out." 
</P>
<P>
Zoos and aviaries often sponsor adoption programs for both special projects and 
general upkeep, says Charles Wickenhauser of the Pittsburgh Zoo, which recently 
raised $6,500 to build a new penguin exhibit through a "penguin parents" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the generation of baby boomers has less of a giving tradition than our 
parents did," he says. "We're trying to find the trigger for their giving and 
trying to find it in nontraditional ways -- what unlocks the purse." 
</P>
<P>
Adoption rates range from $10 to hundreds of dollars. The money is used either 
directly -- to buy housing, medical care and food for the adoptee -- or 
indirectly, to subsidize research, species preservation, educational programs 
or lobby efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, foster parents usually receive a glossy photograph and description 
of their animal, occasional updates about its comings and goings and, just like 
Cabbage Patch dolls, a certificate of adoption. 
</P>
<P>
But adoptions don't work for all environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have something that's there and identifiable, that you can 
photograph and put a name on," says Craig van Note of Monitor Consortium of 
Conservation and Animal Welfare Organizations in Washington D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can really adopt an elephant in Africa. In a case like 
that, you'd have to tell the people their elephant got killed last week, and 
that would be a downer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Florida Manatees 
</P>
<P>
A Florida native, Debra Brown, 33, of Orlando, was accustomed to seeing 
manatees swimming in the state's shallow rivers. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until she received an appeal to adopt "Boomer" that she became 
passionately involved in saving the gentle and fragile animals, most of whom 
bear scars from boat propellers. 
</P>
<P>
"If something happened to Boomer, you'd probably find me in tears," she says. 
"As big and, quote, ugly as manatees are, they're beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Save The Manatee Club of Maitland, Fla., began offering adoptions in 
1984, officials say membership has grown from 800 to 20,000 adults and about 
60,000 students -- 80,000 foster parents in all trying to save a species whose 
population has dwindled to about 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
"Boomer is a manatee who's special to a lot of people now and if something 
happens to Boomer, there are a lot of people who are going to be upset," says 
club director Judith Delaney Vallee. "It's now their manatee." 
</P>
<P>
Adoptions have become the lifeblood of many organizations, which have been 
scrambling for funds since many charitable donations were declared no longer 
tax-deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to whale adoptions, the Massachusetts-based International Wildlife 
Coalition, which monitors several endangered species, has grown from three 
employees in 1983 to 22 now. In the past year, the group sent out 86,000 
humpback whale adoptions for $15 each, 50,000 of which were Christmas gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our files grow faster than we can keep up with," says coalition official 
Margaret King. "People will send it as a gift to someone else -- it's a great 
stocking stuffer. And it crosses all barriers and countries. We have people in 
Saudi Arabia, France, Australia who have adopted whales." 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six humpback whales that migrate yearly to the Cape Cod area can be 
adopted. Individual whales are identified by unique white and gray marks on 
their tails, so foster parents receive a photograph of their whale's tail as it 
breaches the water.

   Flood waters swept a motorist away
Wednesday, closed schools, and forced the evacuation of at least
1,000 people after three days of heavy rain on Florida's central
Gulf Coast.
   Across the overflowing Manatee River from Bradenton, police in
Palmetto, were forced to ride in garbage trucks after street
flooding made patrol cars useless.
   The National Guard was put on alert as forecasters said there
would be no letup Thursday in Florida's heaviest rain since
Hurricane Elena three years ago.
   ``If they call us, we are ready to respond,'' Guard spokesman
Jerry Vaughn said Florida from headquarters in St. Augustine.
   A local state of emergency was declared in Manatee County along
the Manatee River, which was 7 feet above flood stage late
Wednesday afternoon, and was expected to crest at 11{ feet above
flood stage before Thursday.
   The Red Cross opened three shelters for residents of south
Tampa, where waters lapped at car windshields.
   State officials said they were providing four-wheel-drive
vehicles from the Game and Fish Commission to help in the
evacuations, which involved hundreds of homes and at least 1,000
people in Manatee County.
   ``One third of the Interbay peninsula is under water,'' said
Edward J. McElroy, acting manager of emergency operations in Tampa.
   Divers searched unsuccessfully for a man swept away after a car
carrying four people stalled in a drainage ditch in Tampa, then
began to float. The other three people were rescued.
   Witnesses saw James Edward Mercer, 45, surface in the murky
water, his arms flailing, but he was dragged under by the strong
current before rescuers could get to him, said Steve Cole, Tampa
Police Department spokesman.
   Manatee County schools were shut after several were flooded in
the Bradenton area, south of Tampa.
   ``The roads are heavily flooded and we're having sewage problems
with water backing up into the schools,'' said superintendent Gene
Witt. ``In the last 25 years I haven't seen anything of this
magnitude.''
   Almost all low-lying areas were flooded in Pinellas,
Hillsborough, Pasco, Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee, Hernando, Sumter,
Citrus and Polk counties. Most rivers and streams in those counties
either flooded or were forecast to reach flood stage.
   The rain was from a near-stationary cold front that has been
hovering across the Florida Peninsula at the mid-state level,
dumping from 8 to 15 inches of rain, the National Weather Service
said.
   Forecasters predicted Wednesday that 4 more inches could fall
before the front slowly retreats northward.
   In Tampa, a homeowner measured more than 12 inches of rain over
two days. Farther north, in Yankeetown near Cedar Key, the weather
service reported 13 inches had fallen.
   ``All the rivers around here are over their banks,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Eric Hermann in the Yankeetown station.
``There's a lot of street flooding and stuff.''
   Yankeetown holds the national record for 24-hour rainfall of
38.7 inches on Sept. 5-6, 1950.
   Meanwhile, in northeast Florida, about 20 families were
evacuated from their homes after two days of heavy rain caused

Turkmenistan has cut the value of its currency, the manat, to bring the
official and unofficial rates closer together. The new rate, announced on
Tuesday, of 230 manats to the dollar, cuts the rate from the previous
official rate of 10 to the dollar and commercial rate of 75 to the dollar.
The manat, one of the weakest of the new currencies in spite of
Turkmenistan's huge reserves of natural gas, has been devalued by over 90
per cent in stages. The average wage in Turkmenistan is 1,000 manats a
month, though most staples and services are subsidised to very low prices.

  [Text] Turkmenistan has introduced, starting with May, a 
special commercial rate of exchange for its national currency, 
the manat, at which banks will carry out transactions with 
individuals. 
  The rate will be 60 manats per dollar, while the official 
rate is 10 per dollar, and is expected to stay until further 
notice by the Central Bank. Meanwhile, the street value of the 
dollar in Ashkhabad is 90 to 95 manats. 
  All banks are allowed to buy hard currency at that 
commercial 
rate. The country's Vneshekonombank (foreign economic bank) and 
the joint stock commercial bank Turkmenistan have a right to 
exchange manats for dollars at this rate for Turkmenistan 
citizens go abroad while the Investbank will sell hard currency 
to individuals in cashless transactions to enable them to pay 
for cargo transportation abroad. The banks will not handle 
transactions with individuals involving more than 500 dlrs. 
  In mid-March the manat was devalued from 1.99 to 10 per 
dollar. Simultaneously the government announced its intention to 
introduce a floating rate of exchange which was to be dictated 
by the prices at the country's inter-bank exchange. Following 
the first trading on 14 March 1994, when the banks sold 150,000 
dlrs at a rate of 10 manats the exchange was suspended and the 
official rate stayed invariable despite the 30 percent monthly 
inflation rate.

  [Text] As we reported already, Turkmenistan stopped 
supplying gas to Azerbaijan as of 1130 yesterday. 
  [Begin correspondent Nermine Elikhanbeyli recording] After 
having received many warnings, Azerbaijan has finally faced the 
facts. Turkmenistan stopped the natural gas supply to our 
Republic because it wasn't paid for. 
  An Azerbaijani delegation visited Turkmenistan and concluded 
an interstate agreement in February this year envisaging the 
supply of 3 billion cubic meters of gas for 1994. During the 
first quarter of the year, some $50 million of natural gas was 
supplied. According to a clearing agreement, in exchange for 
the gas, our Republic was supposed to send tools used in the oil 
industry, fuel, cooling equipment condensers, and other 
products. But Azerbaijan failed to fulfill its obligation. 
  The state firm Azerigas reported that because the Republic's 
Council of Ministers has adopted no relevant decision, the firm 
is unable to obtain credit and the needed goods. The Council of 
Ministers Finance Department reported that a relevant draft bill 
is being prepared and will be submitted for the approval of the 
prime minister in the coming days. 
  We must realize that we must unfailingly abide by agreements 
if we want to be seen among the ranks of the respectable states. 
We want to note another aspect of this problem. In Baku alone, 
industry owes 2 billion manats and households 9 million manats 
to Azerigas. Failure to pay for the used gas is compounding 
this problem. 
  We would also like to highlight another factor: With its 
60-million population, neighboring Turkey uses only 6 to 8 
billion cubic meters of gas per year, whereas Azerbaijan's 7 
million residents use between 12-14 billion cubic meters of gas. 
Apparently, no one can compete with our wastefulness. [end

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "National Bank Sharply Changes </F>
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates"] 
  [Text] The National Bank of Azerbaijan has sharply changed 
the exchange rates of foreign currency with respect to the 
manat. Now $1 is valued at 1,100 manat. As Abdulla 
Melik-Aslanov, deputy chairman of the board of the National 
Bank, informed a correspondent of the ANS-PRESS agency, the new 
exchange rate is more realistic and acceptable under today's 
critical economic conditions. A. Melik-Aslanov believes the 
increased bank exchange rate will not be accompanied by 
significant changes on the currency black market. He emphasized 
that "more surprises lie in store" with respect to official 
currency exchange rates.

   A storm that triggered floods across central
Florida, causing at least six deaths and the evacuation of 1,000
people, threatened homes and lives as it headed north today,
officials said.
   ``Tampa should be breaking out of the rain ... but north of
Tampa they could still get some pretty substantial rain,'' National
Weather Service meteorologist Randy Lascody said in Miami.
   The storm has swamped the Gulf Coast with up to 15 inches of
rain since Sunday, causing more than $1 million in damage in
hard-hit Manatee County, where a state of emergency was in effect.
   The weather service issued a flash-flood watch for Gulf and
Franklin counties in the Florida Panhandle.
   A wave of showers moving north from the Gulf of Mexico was
expected to settle over northern Florida and southern Georgia by
tonight, Lascody said, adding that ``the real heavy stuff'' should
be heading up the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Gov. Bob Martinez was to tour the stricken Bradenton area of
Manatee County by Florida Air National Guard helicopter today to
decide whether the area should be declared eligible for state
disaster relief money.
   The rising waters left two dead on the west coast. A 44-year-old
Tampa man was presumed drowned after his car plunged into a ditch
and he was sucked into a pipe near downtown Tampa. In New Port
Richey, a 2-year-old boy drowned in a rain-swollen canal.
   The storm also contributed to a small plane crash Wednesday that
killed all four aboard near Williston about 110 miles north of
Tampa, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Ron Bird
said Thursday.
   The rainfall far surpassed the 5 inches dumped by Hurricane
Elena on Labor Day 1985, when wind and high tides did $9 million
damage and sent 13,000 people to shelters.
   In St. Petersburg, hundreds of mostly elderly residents
mistakenly thought the latest flooding was a hurricane.
   ``This is insane,'' Pinellas County Emergency Management
director David Bilodeau said. ``There's just been gross panic for
no reason at all.''
   A tornado struck St. Petersburg Thursday night, causing more
than $20,000 damage to six houses but no injuries, fire officials
said.
   Manatee County commissioners allowed half of the 1,000 evacuees
to return home Thursday as floodwaters began to recede.
   Residents returning home were urged by county public health
officers to disinfect sinks and showers, pitch out any food touched
by flood waters and check wells for broken pipes or flooding.
   Authorities warned about 300 people staying in shelters Thursday
to wait one more day while emergency officials tried to resolve
problems with raw sewage, water 5 feet deep in homes along the
Manatee River and power failures in homes with standing water.

<F P=106> [From the "Business SNARK" file: "Transcaucasia Economic </F>
News"] 
  [Text] Baku--Azerbaijani Ministry for Economics submitted 
the revised forecast of social-economic development for 1994 to 
the Ministry of Finance. 
  By the Milli Majlis proposal, this forecast has to be used 
by 
the Ministry of Finance to correct the budget draft. 
  According to the forecast, the inflation in 1994 reaches 600 
percent. The first option outlined 240 percent inflation. 
  A Finance Ministry official told that his department does 
not 
accept the projected inflation level as inadequate to the real 
economic situation. Only during the first quarter of the 
current year, the inflation exceeded 300 percent, while the 
production output reduced for 25 percent. 
  On the basis of 600-percent level, the Economy Ministry 
expects the GNP at amount of 910 billion manats, and national 
income of 677 billion manats. The initial forecast gave 
respectively 313 and 272 billion manats. 
  A conference with participation of the Milli Majlis 
commissions on economic policy and budget along with the 
corresponding ministries took place in the Azerbaijani Supreme 
Soviet. 
  There was discussed the economic prognosis for 1994, 
submitted by the Economy Ministry. The prognosis was rejected 
because of its "unreality." The prognoses on the inflation rate 
(600 per cent) and the rate of National profit rose the greatest 
censure of the conference participants. 
  Meanwhile, the specialists of the Finance Ministry forecast 
a 
1000 per cent inflation rate in 1994. The prognoses were sent 
for revision.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kuleshov: "President S. Niyazov Ready </F>
To Replace His Government Unless the Consumer Market Is Put in 
Order"] 
  [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] -- It is a long time since 
viewers tuning into the Turkmenistan news have seen the kind of 
dressing down given by President S. Niyazov to ministry and 
department leaders over the abominable state of the consumer 
market. Calling his adjutants [zampred] to attention, the 
Turkmenbashi told them: "All of our slogans and promises are 
worth nothing if store shelves remain empty. People are 
becoming exasperated -- and rightly so. How much longer are you 
going to trade commodities from state resources at market 
prices?!" 
  Store shelves that have been stripped bare and on which you 
will not even find toothpaste, shoe polish, matches, or soap; 
soaring prices at state trade outlets -- not to mention 
commercial kiosks and markets -- even by comparison with those 
in Russia; the despondent faces of people gloomily wandering 
around the stores with the now-worthless manat -- this, 
IZVESTIYA wrote 18 February -- this is the situation in 
Turkmenistan's cities, even in the capital. Nor has it changed 
one iota today. The lack of the essential range of commodities 
conntinues, with the very same wildly inflated prices at state 
retail outlets. 
  How can you live if you earn 200-250 manats while a kg of 
meat at the market costs between 35 and 40 manats, a kg of 
potatoes is 10 manats, and a pack of cigarettes anything from 20 
to 30 manats? Who controls all of this here in the Republic? 
Indeed, is it under control? In the final analysis, who 
regulates prices? These questions were quite rightly asked at 
the Cabinet of Ministers session. 
  Prices are one thing, but the absence of commodities in the 
stores, even those which are produced in Turkmenistan, is 
another problem dogging the consumer market. "Why is it that, 
despite the availability of raw materials and labor, production 
of these goods is not increasing?" S. Niyazov exclaimed 
indignantly, turning to his adjutants. "Who sanctions market 
prices for state resources?" 
  By the way, he put these questions to them some five months 
ago, when the manat was being introduced and when, taking 
advantage of the Turkmenbashi's absence from Turkmenistan, 
departments pushed up prices for goods and foodstuffs so that 
people ended up wandering around the stores as if they were in a 
museum. In those early October days a major dressing down was 
also delivered, but everything was quickly forgotten, and that 
is why today, when returning home from a trip to Moscow, people 
from Turkmenistan cram all their free luggage space with 
sausage, cheese, fresh eggs, jam, confectionery, and fruit in 
the Russian capital, because they will not find any such thing 
at state trade outlets in Turkmenistan. Those who cannot fly to 
Moscow do "the next best thing": On weekends, thousands of 
people from Krasnovodsk, Tashauz, and Mary come to Ashkhabad on 
the local trains and clear out the already impoverished stores, 
despite the exorbitant prices. 
  Giving his adjutants a 10-day breathing space before what is 
left of confidence in the government runs out, the Turkmenistan 
president demanded from it concrete, vigorous action to improve 
the consumer market situation and the supply to the population 
first and foremost of foodstuffs, medicines, and vital 
commodities.

<F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Privileges Granted"] </F>
  [Text] Baku -- President Geydar Aliyev has signed an edict 
on the liberalization of foreign trade on the territory of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan. 
  Henceforth, all restrictions on the export of strategic and 
nonstrategic output by all legal entities observing the law and 
customs and banking procedures are being removed. This will 
primarily make it possible to attract currency from abroad and 
speed up the formation of the republic's currency fund, so 
experts believe. 
  Obviously, this is not a question of total license, because 
a 
special commission will be strictly observing exports. 
  A reliable customs barrier has also been placed in the way 
of 
excesses: It is only possible to export output when its value 
is paid for in hard currency or the relevant banking letter of 
credit provided. The practice of holding of commodity exchanges 
is being introduced -- these will determine the value of output 
destined for export. The role of the national currency -- the 
manat -- is also being strengthened. The exchange rate of the 
manat will be established at currency auctions, which is 
reviving hopes of its convertibility. 
  At the same time as the long-awaited edict, the Azerbaijani 
Ministry of the Economy has also published forecasts for foreign 
trade activity for 1994. The commodity turnover will increase 
by almost $297 million and will constitute $727 million by the 
end of the year. Barter deals will have to be given up. Like 
in previous years, exports are mainly made up of oil and oil 
products (up to 40 percent) and raw cotton (up to 28 percent), 
as well as machine-building, metallurgical, and petrochemical 
output. Currency receipts are also expected from the export of 
caviar. 
  Iran and Turkey occupy a priority position in Azerbaijan's 
foreign economic activity. These countries also account for the 
largest volumes of food product purchases.

<TEXT>
   A virulent form of citrus canker may
have been detected again in a commercial grove in Central Florida,
state Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner announced Tuesday.
   The area in Manatee County already is under restriction because
of previous discoveries of citrus canker A strain in 1986, the
announcement read.
   The discovery was only the second time the canker has been found
in a commercial Florida grove in recent years.
   State and federal plant pathologists ``are conducting extensive
tests on suspicious samples taken from navel orange, red and pink
grapefruit and Hamlin orange trees,'' said a release by Conner's
office.
   In the meantime, officials are surveying the area around the
suspect groves to take action if the tests prove positive, Conner
said.
   There was no response to a telephone call to the agriculture
department seeking elaboration on the announcement, which was made
late Tuesday afternoon.
   After canker was detected in Florida in 1984, federal authorities
declared a temporary embargo on citrus shipments, and the state
burned an estimated 20 million citrus trees. The state has since
been ordered to pay the owners of many of the trees who argued that
agriculture authorities acted too hastily in destroying many groves
not affected by canker
   A meeting of the joint state-federal Citrus Canker Technical
Advisory Committee has been called for Friday in Palmetto to
recommend regulatory measures, Conner said.
   The canker tentatively has been identified as the A strain, the
release said.
   ``Considered one of the more virulent strains of the disease, it
can spread rapidly, producing premature fruit drop as well as stem,
fruit and leaf lesions,'' Conner said.
   The A strain was discovered in the summer of 1986 on residential
trees on Anna Maria Island, in St. Petersburg and in one commercial
grove in Manatee. Since those discoveries, movement of citrus in
Manatee, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties has been strictly
regulated.
   A total of 3,600 infected trees have been discovered to date in
those areas, Conner said.

The former Soviet republic of Turkmenistan yesterday announced it would
issue a national currency at par to the dollar on November 1, Reuter reports
from Moscow.
President Saparmurad Niyazov, of the Central Asian republic, which is the
world's third biggest gas producer, said Russian roubles would be gradually
replaced at an exchange rate of 1,000 roubles to each unit of the new
currency, the manat.
Mr Niyazov, quoted by the Russian Interfax news agency, did not say how the
government would back the manat at this rate, or how much Turkmenistan had
in foreign currency reserves.
Mr Niyazov promised that the minimum monthly wage would be 150 manats and
average pay the equivalent of Dollars 370 to Dollars 400 after the exit from
the rouble zone takes effect.

had been attempted on a manatee. The use of a cellular phone
greatly simplified the procedure, according to Seaquarium spokesman
Walt Robshaw.
   ``Otherwise, we would have to hire a crane, put her in a sling
and take her out of the tank,'' he said.
   Dr. Gregory Bossart, a Seaquarium veterinarian, lowered the
water level in the pool, rolled Naples over on her back and put the
machine on her chest.
   The EKG signal was transmitted to a laboratory in Roslyn, N.Y.,
by putting the telephone mouthpiece over the machine. It took less
than two minutes, with results back in about two hours, Robshaw
said.
   ``It took a while to get the results because the lab didn't have
anything to compare it to,'' Robshaw said.
   The EKG was conducted because an earlier examination showed
fluid around Naples' heart.
   What's good news for Naples may be even better news for pygmy
sperm whales.
   Bossart thinks the process could help discover why the whales
beach themselves. In a study of 18 dead adult whales, Bossart found
that all had died from congestive heart failure.
   He thinks the new process will enable scientists to examine
whales while they are still alive.
   The portable EKG machine is about the size of a television
remote control device, Robshaw said. The cellular phone allows the
unit to be used almost anywhere _ even a manatee pool at Seaquarium.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Yusifova: "Banks Have Been Audited"] </F>
  [Text] The Main Administration for Banking Control of the 
National Bank of Azerbaijan audited 31 commercial and joint 
stock-commercial banks in the first quarter of 1994. 
  The audits revealed the following shortcomings: To this day 
a 
large amount of indebtedness on loans remains at many commercial 
banks; unlawful increases in banks' statutory fund, failure of 
some joint-stock banks to issue stock, absence of registrations 
by the Ministry of Finance of the republic, violations of the 
quota of cash holdings, provision of cash services to customers 
without permission from the National Bank, violations of rules 
in the process of accepting customer documents, violations of 
the economic standards of banks, failure to meet compulsory 
reserve requirements, and deficiencies in opening accounts have 
occurred. 
  For the most part the absence of letters of guarantee from 
enterprises which are indebted to the banks, guarantees of 
security for personal property, and other credit guarantees, as 
well as the absence of control over the use of the credit issued 
were the reasons for the violations. 
  Besides, it was noted that the founders of the Naftabank 
commercial bank have contributed to the statutory fund 460,000 
manats out of the funds issued to them as a loan. Five other 
commercial banks have violated the percentage ratio for 
contributing monies to the statutory fund (it should be no 
greater than 12 percent). Some banks were not adequately 
equipped with security devices. Seventeen banks were fined 
11.049 million manats for failing to comply with compulsory 
reserve requirements. In 728 cases, enterprises did not have 
certificates of registration with the tax inspectorate. Some 178 
enterprises and organizations have not been registered by the 
Ministry of Justice.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Currency change puts pressure on republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA appears to have achieved the main objective of its currency reform:
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, said yesterday the forced
exchange of pre-1993 roubles had compelled former Soviet republics still
using the Russian currency to opt in or out of the rouble zone.
He said republics which had remained members of the rouble zone - using
roubles issued by the Bank of Russia as their only, or parallel, currency -
had to decide whether to stay in or move out. The net effect seems to be to
have whittled the 'rouble core' down to six.
Before last week's currency upheaval five republics had already left the
zone; the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and
Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine. Only the Estonian crown can be described as 'stable'
while the Ukrainian karbovanet has been steadily dropping against the
rouble.
Four more republics have now given notice that they will leave the rouble
zone this year (though in practice these decisions are subject to delay).
Azerbaijan yesterday announced it would leave the zone as soon as possible -
the government has given its central bank two days to work out a mechanism
for withdrawing the rouble and replacing it with the manat - at present a
parallel currency.
Georgia has said that it will introduce its own currency from August. It
currently supplies coupons to supplement roubles and the government has said
citizens have one week to swap roubles for coupons, to a limit of
Rbs100,000.
Moldova has said it will now introduce coupons for all transactions and will
speed the introduction of the leu, which is being printed in Romania.
One problem in Moldova is its large Russian-speaking minority in the
self-styled TransDnestrian republic who have refused to switch to coupons
and still use the rouble.
Turkmenistan is to bring forward the introduction of its manat, from January
next year to October 1993. The manat notes and tenge coins are already
arriving in Ashkhabad, the Turkmen capital and are likely to be valued at
1:1 with the dollar.
Mr Mukhammed Abalakov, the economics and finance minister, said yesterday
the Russian move was a 'stab in the back' for the other republics, and that
they should have been given at least six months notice.
The remaining six republics, including Russia, have opted to remain in the
rouble zone, at least for now. Armenia has made the most fuss - Mr Levan
Barkhudaryan, the finance minister, said the cash exchange was 'a direct
violation of all previous agreements on currencies' but its economy is in
such a dire state that it can no nothing. Belarus has stepped into line, as
it usually does with Russian decisions. Citizens can exchange up to
Rbs50,000, but must put larger amounts in a six month deposit account at an
annual interest rate of 60 per cent. Mr Viktor Danilenko, the Belarus
ambassador in Moscow, rebuked the Russian government, saying that they had
dumped a 'railroad car' full of old notes on Belarus only a day before the
central bank announcement. He declined to say whether Belarus would bring in
its own currency.
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have both said they will fall into line, although
citizens can continue to use the old notes for the time being. Kazakhstan,
has said it will withdraw the old notes but it is awaiting a sufficient
quantity of new notes before effecting the switch.

UKRAINE needs a 'tactical retreat' from the coupon, the republic's faltering
quasi-currency, and re-introduction of the Russian rouble, according to Mr
Vadim Hetman, chairman of the Ukraine National Bank.
The National Bank of Ukraine is emerging as the strongest proponent of
tougher economic policies for the republic, but fears its belt-tightening
measures will be opposed by Mr Vitold Fokin, the prime minister.
The showdown could come in September, when Mr Hetman plans to present a
tough stabilisation programme to parliament. The struggle will pit the
technocrats at the National Bank, who are itching to become members of good
standing in the international banking community, against Mr Fokin's insular,
Communist-dominated cabinet of ministers, which is struggling to preserve a
command economy.
First introduced in January as a stop-gap solution to Ukraine's severe
shortage of roubles, the coupon now accounts for 97 per cent of official
cash transactions in Ukraine.
However the government's ballooning budget deficit and lax credit policies
have rapidly eroded the value of the coupon from an initial two or three
roubles to the current rate of between 60 and 65 kopeks.
'The state of the coupon is a national tragedy,' Mr Hetman said at an
emotional press conference over the weekend closed to foreign journalists.
'We took a series of provocative acts against the coupon which no currency
in the world could endorse and which no other government in the world could
countenance.'
Mr Hetman, a hard-headed manager who ran Ukraine's largest commercial bank
before moving to the National Bank this spring, outlined a two-part strategy
to rescue the coupon.
In the short-term, Mr Hetman said: 'We must arrange a temporary marriage
with the rouble. This is a tactical retreat.'
In a move piloted in Crimea last week, Mr Hetman would like to re-introduce
the rouble as a parallel currency in mainland Ukraine, where state stores
only accept coupons.
In the long term, Mr Hetman wants to restrict the issuing of coupons by
putting a ceiling on wages and severely cutting credits to inefficient state
enterprises.
However, discussions of these proposals late on Friday with Mr Fokin did not
encourage him. 'The prime minister does not want us to take these steps but
wants us to stick with the old policy,' he said.
Mr Hetman blamed Mr Fokin's government and the parliament for Ukraine's
runaway inflation.
'The parliament and the government continue to print money and to endorse
increasingly costly programmes, despite the repeated protests of the
National Bank,' he said.
Mr Hetman warned that, if the introduction of Ukraine's long-awaited
separate currency, the hryvnia, was to be successful, 'these 'stabilisation'
measures must be implemented by the end of the year.' The final decision on
when to introduce the hryvnia would be taken in September.
The manner in which several CIS members are tinkering with the rouble is
causing growing alarm to the monetary authorities in Moscow, writes John
Thornhill in Moscow.
On Saturday, Azerbaijan announced it was to print a new currency, the manat,
to supplement a shortage of roubles circulating in the trans-Caucasian
state. Workers will now receive 20 per cent of their pay in manats. The
Azeri central bank said it would issue three different denominations of
manat bank notes. One manat would be equivalent to 10 roubles.
Other former Soviet republics have also issued parallel currencies, although
only Estonia has completely abandoned the rouble-introducing its own kroon.
Many western economists and bankers have argued that a proliferation of
national currencies among the republics of the former Soviet Union will only
hamper trade within the region.
