<LEADPARA>  WHEN Swedish parents wake up Dec. 13, their eldest girl greets them with
breakfast gifts of fragrantly spiced breads and cakes that she made herself.; 
 The girl represents the good St. Lucia and officially opens the family's
Christmas season. She's dressed in a white gown, and on her head, she wears an
evergreen wreath illuminated by candles.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Native Swede Christin Jannesson, one of the founders of the Tri-City
Scandinavian Club, says that the traditions surrounding the St. Lucia festival
"can be traced back to when Sweden was becoming a Catholic country," about the
12th century.;   According to Jannesson, before Christianity was introduced,
the early Swedes held a yearly winter celebration in which they honored a
heathen goddess of the rising sun.;   They believed that she would safely help
them come out of the darkest time of the year as she rose with the rising sun
to give the world life and new hope.;   Since the Catholic calendar celebrates
a different saint for each of the 365 days of the year, the priests were
always looking for saints to match with heathen gods to make the early Swedes
more comfortable with the new religion. St. Lucia, whose day is Dec. 13, fit
in well with the old winter festival because legend said that she gave her
eyes, the symbol of light and life, to a blind beggar.;   St. Lucia Day was so
popular in Sweden that the Swedes continued to celebrate it when they became
Protestant in the 16th century.;   "In the old tradition, special foods that
were considered to have magical powers were to be eaten on St. Lucia Day,"
Jannesson said. "In order to be fruitful and lucky in the coming year, you
were supposed to eat bread and cakes made with saffron or ginger first thing
in the morning on St. Lucia Day.";   Bakers still form the breads into
traditional shapes, she said. The most common is the figure 8, the symbol of
infinity.;   "Since St. Lucia Day is our most beloved tradition, each Swedish
city, town, school and office has their own Lucia party," Jannesson said. "A
national Lucia is selected who is supposed to be a blond girl possessing
wonderful qualifications like a Miss America. She spends the year doing
charitable deeds.";   To share their Christmas traditions with other Tri-City
residents, the Swedes of the Tri-City Scandinavian Club invite the community
to their Swedish Christmas party Friday from 5 to 8 p.m. Held at the Senior
Center at Lake Elizabeth, the party is an ideal way to experience this unique
Christmas pageant. Admission is free but donations for the International
Travel Scholarship Fund for local students are welcome.;   After the Lucia
Pageant of Lights featuring Tri-City children of Swedish descent, there will
be food for sale, Swedish Christmas games for children, handcrafted
traditional ornaments, music and a visit by Tompten, Sweden's Santa Claus. For
information, call Christin Jannesson at (510) 490-4594.;   Jannesson, who
learned to cook from her mother when she was a teen-ager, has created her own
versions of these traditional Swedish Christmas recipes.; CHRISTIN'S CHRISTMAS

<LEADPARA>  WHEN it comes to Easter, most cooks follow traditions straight down the line
-- Easter eggs, chocolate bunnies and pineapple-glazed ham.;    The National
Pork Producers Council speculates that ham first became a staple of Easter
because of timing. In the pre-refrigeration days, farmers would slaughter
their hogs in the fall and cure them with saltpeter, a process that took six
to seven months. The first ham of the season would be ready just in time for
the Easter table.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     With the demands of a health-conscious society, ham is as much as 57
percent leaner than the ham of 20 years ago.;    A 3-ounce serving of ham has
less cholesterol than a 3-ounce skinless chicken breast, the same amount of
calories and somewhat higher fat content. However, be aware of the high sodium
content in most ham products because sodium compounds are added in the curing
process.;    There are many specialty hams on the market, a result of
different curing methods. Perhaps the best known is country or country-style
ham, such as Smithfield. Country hams are slowly dry-cured with salt, then
smoked and aged.;    A boneless or canned ham yields four to five servings per
pound while a bone-in ham has two to three servings per pound.;    Cooking
methods;  To cook a ham, follow the cooking instructions on the label, if
available, or in the recipe. Whole hams or ham portions should be roasted or
cooked in liquid. Slices may be broiled or pan broiled. Most hams are fully
cooked, but if the label doesn't say so, assume it is a cook-before-eating
ham.;    A fully cooked ham is ready to eat, but if served warm, heat it to an
internal temperature of 140 degrees. A cook-before-eating ham should be heated
to an internal temperature of 160 degrees.;    (check) To roast: Place ham in
an open roasting pan. Roast at 325 degrees to an internal temperature of 140
degrees (for fully cooked hams) or 160 degrees (for a cook-before-eating
ham).;    (check) To cook in liquid: Cover the ham with liquid and simmer four
to five hours to an internal temperature of 160 degrees. The hams most
commonly cooked in liquid are country-style hams and cook-before-eating hams.;
   (check) To broil: Place ham slice 3 to 5 inches from heat until lightly
brown. Turn and broil second side. To pan broil, place ham slice in heavy
frying pan. Do not cover. Brown slowly, turning occasionally.;    Here are
some glaze recipes to update the traditional ham and a recipe for relish. Most
glazes should be added during the last 15 to 30 minutes of cooking time,
unless instructed otherwise.; TOMATILLO-PAPAYA RELISH;  8 medium tomatillos,
stem and outer husk removed, medium diced;  1 large papaya, peeled, seeded and
cubed;  1/4 medium red onion;  2 tablespoons cilantro, minced;   Juice of 1
lime;  1/2 red bell pepper, diced;  1 teaspoon black pepper;  1 teaspoon salt;
 2 ounces olive oil;  1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper;   Combine all ingredients
and mix well. Refrigerate and serve cold.;    -- Stephen Ford, executive;
chef, Wellshire Inn, Denver; CACTUS PEAR HAM GLAZE;  10 ripe cactus pears,
peeled;  1/2 cup honey;  1/4 cup sugar;  1 teaspoon ground cloves;  3 ounces
cornstarch;  3 ounces water;   Purchase cactus pears as much in advance as
possible to assure ripeness. An unripened cactus pear has a green skin and is
very firm. The skin of a ripe cactus pear is reddish and softer. To ripen a
cactus pear, simply leave at room temperature, similar to an avocado. A ripe
pear will hold in the refrigerator more than a week.;    To peel a cactus
pear, cut off the top and bottom, make a 1/4-inch incision lengthwise, and
start peeling off the outer and inner skin with a paring knife. The edible
portion of the cactus pear is a very bright purple color with small seeds.;   
Puree peeled cactus pear in food processor and strain into bowl to remove
seeds and pulp. Work liquid out of pulp with kitchen spoon. Discard remaining
seeds and pulp. Bring cactus pear liquid to a boil in a non-reactive
saucepan.;    Mix cornstarch and water in separate bowl and whip it into pear
mixture to thicken. Add remaining ingredients and simmer for 5 minutes.;   
Spread glaze on baked ham the last 20 minutes of cooking time.;    -- Stephen
Ford; MAPLE-ORANGE HAM GLAZE;  1/3 cup pure maple syrup;  1/3 cup orange
marmalade;  2 teaspoons prepared horseradish;  2 teaspoons prepared mustard;  
In small saucepan, combine ingredients. Over medium heat, bring to a boil;
simmer 4 minutes. Use to baste ham frequently during last 30 minutes of
baking. Makes 2/3 cup.; APRICOT-GLAZED EASTER HAM;  1 3- to 5-pound fully
cooked boneless ham;  1/2 cup apricot preserves;  3 tablespoons Dijon mustard;
 2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger root;   Fresh apricots, optional;   Fresh
watercress, optional;   In small bowl, combine preserves, mustard and ginger.
Stir until well blended. Score ham and place in shallow baking pan; shield
ends with foil.;    Insert meat thermometer. Brush ham with 1/4 cup of glaze.
Bake, uncovered, at 325 degrees until thermometer registers 140 degrees, 15 to
20 minutes per pound. Brush with remaining glaze every 15 minutes. To serve,
garnish with fresh apricots and watercress.;    Makes 4 to 5 servings per
pound.; PEACH-GLAZED COUNTRY HAM;  1 10- to 14-pound country-style ham;  2/3
cup peach preserves;   Pecan halves;  Using a stiff brush, thoroughly scrub
the country-style ham. Place ham in a large pot; cover with water and soak for
12 to 24 hours, changing water several times. Drain. Cover ham with fresh
water and bring to a boil. Simmer 15 to 18 minutes per pound.;    When ham is
cool enough to handle, remove the rind with a sharp knife, leaving 1/4-inch
layer of fat. Score the ham at 1-inch intervals. Spread with peach preserves
and dot with pecan halves. Bake ham at 400 degrees about 20 minutes or until
the glaze browns.;    Serves 20.; TYPES OF HAM; If you've never cooked ham
before -- or even if you have -- here's a primer on Easter's favorite meat:;
(box)Boneless hams: All bones have been removed and most of the fat trimmed
away before being fully cooked. Processors section the ham, remove the fat and
bone, and reform the ham.; (box)Canned hams: Boneless, placed in cans,
vacuum-sealed and then fully cooked. Natural dry gelatin may be added before
sealing to absorb the juices as the ham cooks.; (box)Bone-in hams: Sold in
whole hams, shank and rump halves, shank and rump portions, and center slices.
Some hams are semi-boneless with only the round leg bone or the shank bone
remaining.; COOKING TIMES; Because of the variations in ham size, the pork
industry recommends using a meat thermometer as your best gauge:;
(box)Boneless: 3 to 4 pounds: 20 minutes per pound; 4 to 6 pounds: 18 to 25
minutes per pound; 7 to 12 pounds: 15 to 18 minutes per pound.; (box)Bone-in:
7 to 9 pounds: 18 to 25 minutes per pound; 13 to 16 pounds: 15 to 18 minutes
per pound.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  VACAVILLE; DRUG; STORE; SALE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  This city is going to have to find another business to call the oldest in town
after this month.;    That is when Boyd Harris will have completed folding up
the current titleholder, the 1879-vintage Vacaville Drug Co., which since the
1890s has held down the triangular corner of Main and Merchant streets in this
bustling old farming center.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  VACAVILLE DRUGGIST SELLING OFF A PIECE OF
AMERICANA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Until then, he is holding a going-out-of-business sale of a sort possible
only for a drugstore that's been in business more than a century.;    "A lot
of this stuff I never even used myself. It was out of date when I bought this
place in 1966," Harris said in a conversation frequently interrupted by a
parade of bargain seekers at the cash register.;    For the past 25 years,
Harris had shown up for work in his pharmacist's smock and a pair of slacks,
but on this day, for the first time, he had left his smock at home and worn a
polo shirt and blue jeans to the store.;    "It really feels strange, dressed
like this, but prices are 40 percent off, and I knew I'd be busy," he said.
"And besides, I've already closed the pharmacy, so I won't be filling
prescriptions anymore.";    Instead, he is selling off the store:
run-of-the-mill drugstore stuff such as corn plasters, toothbrushes, patent
medicines and gift items plus all sorts of store fixtures and equipment --
plus ancient pharmacological artifacts that few drugstores would even possess
these days.;    In the area of the store where his pharmacy was until he sold
it and its files and computer to the local Pay Less outlet, Harris has set up
an array of old drugs, bottles, cans, labels and implements for sale.;   
There are rolls of quaint old Vacaville Drug Co. gummed labels imprinted with
the likes of saltpeter, prepared chalk, powdered orris root, rose water,
castor oil, even arsenic and insect powder.;    "I'm selling the old labels
for $5 a roll. They probably cost more than that to get printed back around
the turn of the century, but I don't know what else to do with them. I've
already given a whole pile of stuff to the Vacaville Museum," Harris said.;   
Likewise, he has a seemingly inexhaustible supply of six-sided Pepto Mangan
patent medicine bottles, all blue-green with age, that date to the turn of the
century or before.;    He also has boxes of ancient homeopathic remedies,
boxes and cans of medical compounds, old canes and crutches, and veterinary
supplies and equipment.;    Harris, 66, said he decided to close the business
rather than try to sell it after a few informal inquiries revealed that there
would not likely be much of a market for a small, independent drugstore in
this era of superstores.;    "The old corner drug is a piece of Americana
that's not long for this world," he said.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union acknowledged Wednesday that
something exploded at one of its chemical factories last week, but
denied U.S. claims that it was rocket fuel used for a new
long-range nuclear missile.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said three
people were killed and five injured in the explosion May 12 in a
storage area of the plant at Pavlograd, about 500 miles southwest
of Moscow in the Ukraine.
   He said the chemicals involved were explosives used in civilian
industry, not fuel for the new SS-24 intercontinental ballistic
missile.
   U.S. officials in Washington said Tuesday the Pavlograd plant is
the sole facility for manufacturing the main rocket motors for the
SS-24.
   Gerasimov said in a telephone interview he did not know whether
the plant made either the motors or fuel for them. He said the
explosion occurred at 7:15 a.m. and that casualties were minimized
because the storage area was highly automated.
   A brief report by the Tass news agency's English-language
service said 12 tons of ``quarry powder'' blew up. Its
Russian-language report identified the material as ammonite and
said it exploded in a loading area of an internal warehouse at the
Pavlogradsky Chemical Factory.
   Ammonite is an explosive compound of 70 percent to 90 percent
ammonium nitrate and saltpeter, or potassium nitrate.
   According to the Tass report in Russian, the factory makes
industrial explosive materials. It identified them as rock
ammonium, alumotol and other ammonia products.
   The U.S. Defense Department said the explosion ``destroyed
several buildings at a Soviet propellant plant in Pavlograd.''
   An American source in Washington said the explosion ``sure tore
that plant up,'' but Gerasimov said it did not cause major damage.
``It's not catastrophic,'' he told The Associated Press.
   One Washington source said U.S. spy satellites detected the
explosion.
   Pavlograd is a city of 122,000 people about 30 miles east of
Dnepropetrovsk, a major industrial center. Gerasimov said there was
no evacuation of the area after the explosion.
   Tass reported that, nine hours after the explosion, Mayor I.N.
Prikhodko assured residents over the local radio station there was
no danger to health or the environment. A regional health official
repeated the message the next day, the agency said.
   Its report, which said the cause was being investigated, was the
first on the explosion by national Soviet media.
   The SS-24 carries 10 warheads and can be launched from
underground silos or rail cars. Deployment began last year.
   U.S. officials said the Soviets probably would not be able to
resume SS-24 production for at least six months.

<TEXT>
   A group trying to extort $1.6 million mailed poison
and explosives to five branches of a Japanese bank, police said
today.
   Authorities in Osaka said the target of the extortion attempt is
the Sanwa Bank. They said parcels containing threatening letters
along with the poison and explosives were sent in the last two
weeks to Sanwa branches in Osaka and the western cities of Okayama
and Takamatsu.
   One police spokesman said the poison included cyanide and
arsenide and that there was enough to kill about 3,000 people. He
said the explosives included picric acid and saltpeter.
   According to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
one of the letters read: ``We have obtained 14 weapons, including
poison and explosives such as cyanide, arsenide, arsenic acid,
dynamite and black explosives for a revolution. ... We don't want
to be forced to give them to the Red Army. You'll buy them for 200
million yen.''
   The figure is equivalent to $1.6 million. The Red Army is a
leftist Japanese terrorist group.
   The police spokesman was unable to say why the extortionists
chose Sanwa. Bank spokesman Soichi Hayakawa said, ``We can't even
guess why, judging from the contents of the letters.''
   Police said the first parcel was mailed April 4 to Sanwa's
Kawara-machi Branch in Osaka. A note demanded the branch give 200
million yen in two cardboard boxes to a deliveryman who would visit
the branch three days later.
   Sanwa informed police of the attempt, and police formed a
35-member special task force. No one came for the money on April 7.
   More parcels were sent to the other Sanwa branches, with the
last one delivered Tuesday to the Takamatsu branch on Shikoku
island, about 344 miles southwest of Tokyo. This time, there were
no instuctions on what the bank should do with the 200 million yen.
   Instead, police officials said, the letter in the parcel read in
part: ``We note that our proposal has been rejected. ... We may
become the killers.''
   Sanwa, ranked fifth among Japanese banks in fund volume, is
based in Osaka and has branches in Tokyo and other major Japanese
cities.

<LEADPARA>  WE THINK that an authentic curry fires the mouth to the point of dulling the
senses. Indian restaurants sometimes rate their curries on a scale of 1 to 10
for Westerners. One that I know puts up a plaque if you manage a 10.;    Yet,
curry should not be simply fiery heat. Curry, more than a peppery paste, is a
confusing-to-the-palate mixture of spices that can be endlessly adjusted.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When cooking with curry, you can emphasize different aspects of its flavor,
depending on the dish you're making. You might want to increase the saffron,
dill and mustard powder for a seafood curry, giving an astringency flavor,
like a squeeze of lemon. A lamb curry could be heavy on coriander, cardamom
and cloves. Add more cayenne to make it hot.;    When adding curry powder to a
dish, cook the curry powder first in a little oil, allowing the flavors to
blossom before you add the liquid. Cooking it for a long time mellows the
flavor without weakening its presence. I nearly always add fresh dill whenever
I'm using commercial curry powder. It takes away a stale quality.;  CURRY
POWDER;  1/2 teaspoon ground cloves;  1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon;  1
tablespoon fennel seeds;  1/2 tablespoon dill seeds or 1 tablespoon dried dill
leaves;  1 tablespoon turmeric;  1 tablespoon whole coriander;  1 to 2

saffron;  1/2 teaspoon celery seeds;  1 tablespoon dried fenugreek;  1/2
tablespoon dry mustard;  1 teaspoon cumin seeds;  4 bay leaves;   Combine all
ingredients in a blender, processor or electric coffee grinder and process to
a powder. Store in airtight container. Makes about 1/2 cup.; (hbox);   
SEAFOOD AND CHICKEN CURRY;  1 cup chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth; 
1 cup clam juice;  1 tablespoon oil;  3 Italian sausages;  1 medium onion,

saffron;  1/2 teaspoon ground coriander;  1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds;  1/4

chocolate refrigerator cake requested by Mary Taylor of Livermore, Laurie
Bishop of Saratoga wrote: "I couldn't help but put my two cents worth in and
I've enclosed an old family recipe for an 'authentic' ice box cake. You can
tell it's old by the use of a double boiler. I believe it was brought to this
country by my grandmother's German housekeeper, Frieda. It is certainly not
for the calorie or cholesterol minded among us, but it is truly a memorable
dessert. It is not as complicated as it sounds and, by making it a day ahead,
it is easy to serve at a party. I've never seen this in any cookbook or food

bottom of a springform pan with ladyfingers, separated. Melt chocolate in
double boiler. Add sugar, water and the 6 egg yolks, well beaten. Cook slowly
until thick and smooth, stirring constantly. When cool, add stiffly beaten egg
whites, folding them into mixture and not over stirring. Place half of the
filling in cake form and put a layer of ladyfingers on top. Add rest of
filling. Place remaining ladyfingers on the top like spokes of a wheel. Place
a plate on top to hold in place. Place in refrigerator and let stand 20 to 24
hours. When ready to serve, remove from pan and place cake with tin bottom on
platter and cover with whipped cream. Decorate with cherries, if desired.;
Help to finish recipe; Betty Auchard of Los Gatos is searching for a recipe
for foaming sauce served with Railroad Pudding. "My grandmother sent me the
pudding recipe in 1961," Auchard writes, "along with a note that said bake the
pudding and serve with foaming sauce. I think I can figure out the baking
time, the pan and temperature but I don't know how to make the sauce. This was
a popular recipe in the 1900s." She sends the pudding recipe along to see if
it will jog some memories.; RAILROAD PUDDING; 1 egg; 1 cup sugar; 1 tablespoon
butter, melted; 1 1/2 cups flour; 1 teaspoon baking powder; 1/2 cup milk; 1

remembers a dish served in York, Pa., that included shrimp cooked in the
shell. "I only remember the shrimp, celery leaf and vinegar ingredients. Can
someone provide the recipe?";   Cheryl Calmis  of Redwood City is looking for
a recipe for sweet corn cake such as that served at El Torito restaurant.;  
Deloras Giovannetti  of San Jose would like two recipes: one for a soft, chewy
praline candy, and one for a daffodil cake made with pineapple ("possibly a
1930s recipe," she writes).;   Marx Parish  of Campbell also seeks two
recipes: one for preserving fruit in brandy and another for the artichoke
seasoning as prepared and served at the Chart House on Maui.;   And Roy A.
Blockinger of San Jose wonders if there really is a recipe for humble pie.

<HEAD>Chances Are That July 4 Firecracker Was Made in China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the fireworks being set off to
celebrate American freedom this week were shipped from China before
that country's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, a
fireworks expert says.
   The Chinese have targeted the U.S. fireworks market since
relations improved during the Nixon administration and now dominate
the market, said John A. Conkling, a Maryland chemist who heads the
American Pyrotechnics Association.
   Conkling, who operates a seasonal ``Fireworks Hotline'' in
Washington, said shipments from China had either arrived or were
aboard vessels by the time the disturbances began that led to last
month's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. Hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of people were killed.
   ``I think the fact that for the past 15 years we've celebrated
Independence Day with fireworks coming from a communist country
means there has been an irony quite a while,'' he said. ``It is
heightened by the incidents this year.''
   Most fireworks used by Americans come from overseas, more than
half from China, he said, adding that the question concerning
possible trade sanctions would be, ``Whom do you punish?''
   In 1987, the latest year for which he had full statistics, 50
million pounds of fireworks came to the United States directly from
China and more than 10 million pounds came from China by way of Hong
Kong distributors. That left just 6 million pounds exported to the
United States by the rest of the world, including such former
fireworks-making giants as Taiwan and Macao.
   Most of the fireworks are of the backyard variety _ firecrackers,
Roman candles, skyrockets _ and not the kind seen at public displays.
   Commerce Department figures show Chinese shipments of
``explosives and pyrotechnics'' have risen steadily since 1983, when
they were valued at $33.4 million, to $51.2 million in 1987.
   The Chinese, who made ``fire lances'' with a mixture of
saltpeter, sulfur and charcoal as early as the 12th century, now
tailor their products for Americans.
   For instance, the Chinese began making sparklers because
Americans wanted them.
   Many of the fireworks on display at roadside stands still have
distinct oriental imagery: pagodas, blossoms and butterflies.
   A $13 package put together by a New Jersey company is called the
``Miss Liberty'' assortment. A few of the pieces in it are Chinese,
including one with unintended timeliness: A tiny Chinese-made paper
tank moves on the ground and ``emits flaming pellets.''
   For years, controversy over the Chinese imports has involved
safety rather than questions of politics or human rights in China.
   Last year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Customs
Service seized so many Chinese fireworks for bad labels, short fuses
or gunpowder overloads that the industry had to shut down for a time.
   Conkling was among a group of American experts who toured the
Chinese fireworks provinces last year to work with the makers on
safety standards.

<TEXT>     Crisp Roquefort crackers are so tasty they can be served without a spread.
(Make lots because you can't eat just one.);    Ho-hum canned olives come
alive with flavor and can become addictive when marinated in mustard and
herbs. Packaged won ton skins are transformed to spicy whimsical curled
ribbons when deep fried and accompanied by a chili mint dipping sauce.;    And
for those who can't conceive of football without peanuts, combine them with
raisins and chocolate for a chunky sweet treat.;  CHOCOLATE NUT AND RAISIN
CLUSTERS;  1 pound bittersweet chocolate, cut into small pieces for melting; 
1 cup raisins;  1 cup dry roasted peanuts;   Over low heat or in top of double
boiler, melt chocolate, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in
raisins and peanuts. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto a sheet of waxed paper. Place
in cool dry place until chocolate clusters are firm. Makes about 36.; (hbox); 
  ROQUEFORT CRACKER CRISPS;  1/2 cup butter, room temperature;  1/2 pound
Roquefort cheese, room temperature;  1 cup flour;  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground
black pepper;   Combine all ingredients until well blended and smooth. Form
into 2 rolls 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap in waxed paper and refrigerate
until firm, at least 3 hours. Slice into 1/4-inch thick. Preheat oven to 400
degrees. Bake on ungreased cookie sheet 10 minutes or until lightly browned.
Remove and store in airtight container. Makes about 36.; (hbox);    CURRIED
WON TON RIBBONS WITH CHILI MINT DIP;  1 package won ton skins;   Oil for deep
frying;  1/2 to 1 teaspoon curry powder;  1/4 teaspoon salt;   Arrange won
tons in stacks of 6 and cut into 3/4-inch strips with serrated pastry wheel.
In medium pan, heat enough oil to deep fry to 375 degrees and fry several
ribbons at a time until golden brown. They will curl up as they cook. Drain on
paper towels and sprinkle with curry and salt.; DIP;  1/2 cup yogurt;  2 green
onions, chopped;  2 green chilies, seeded and chopped;  1 tablespoon brown
sugar;  1/4 cup chopped mint leaves;  3/4 cup chopped fresh coriander leaves; 
 Salt and pepper;   Combine all ingredients until well blended.; (hbox);   
MUSTARD MARINATED; OLIVES;  2 cups water;  1/2 cup white wine vinegar;  1 bay
leaf;  1 tablespoon mustard seed;  1/2 teaspoon salt;  1/2 teaspoon black
peppercorns;  1 tablespoon sugar;  2 16-ounce cans pitted black olives,
drained;  2 tablespoons chopped parsley;   In medium saucepan, bring all
ingredients to a boil except olives and parsley. Simmer, covered 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and place olives in mixture. Allow to cool and then transfer
to jar and place in refrigerator for 24 hours. Drain olives and sprinkle with
parsley. Makes about 4 cups.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  RECIPE; LIST; FOOD; FAMILY; LIFESTYLE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WAKE up: It's time for breakfast.;    Too busy, you say. Never can eat in the
morning. Got to get the kids up, dog walked, cat fed, coffee made, paper read,
lunches packed, self washed and dressed and out the door. Who has time to eat
breakfast, let alone cook it?  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NO TIME FOR BREAKFAST IS NO EXCUSE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     True, weekday mornings are not the time for most of us to whip up pancakes
or even scramble an occasional egg. But aren't you weary of the old
cereal-bagel-toast-juice routine?;    Thought so. Why not rethink the day's
first meal? How about breakfast pizza? A baked apple? A toasted slice of
homemade quick bread with cheese? A made-by-you frozen yogurt pop? A warm
slice of homemade quiche?;    Breakfast fruit;  Imagine the first bite from a
bowl of cold, juicy grapefruit and orange sections, sprinkled with a few
berries and a mango slice or so.;    Impossible? Nah. Not if you're willing to
do a little planning, a little night-before preparation and a little weekend
baking. Then, rely on the microwave and blender to jump-start your mornings.; 
  While you're at all this breakfast revamping, consider starting a family
tradition of Saturday or Sunday morning pancakes, waffles or French toast.
Make a double batch and freeze the rest. Put them in one layer on a baking
sheet and freeze until firm; then bag or wrap. You can take out one or more as
you need and microwave them.;    Thoughts for food;  Here are some more ideas
for breakfast. (A few of them are from an article in a September 1988 issue of
1,001 Home Ideas magazine.);    (box) Breakfast pizza: Why not? And who says
pizza has to have tomato sauce? A slice of mozzarella cheese on an English
muffin or pita bread, a sprinkle of oregano, a minute under the broiler and
you're set.;    (box) Bake a breakfast quiche from your favorite recipe, but
substitute Canadian bacon, liquid egg substitute and reduced-fat cheese for
higher-fat ingredients such as bacon or ham, eggs and rich cheese. Cool, slice
into servings, wrap well and freeze. Rewarm in the microwave.;    (box) Top
your favorite toast with sliced tomatoes and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.
Broil until bubbly.;    (box) Top a rice cake with cottage cheese and berries
or peanut butter and bananas.;    (box) For quick baked apples, prepare the
night before and refrigerate. Rewarm in the microwave and add a dollop of
vanilla yogurt.;    (box) Yogurt. Need we say more? Try it with a helping of
wheat germ on top. Stir in a spoonful of all-fruit spread. Add a few raisins.;
   (box) Spend a little extra for individual boxes of cereal to toss into a
briefcase or lunch box. Or be more frugal and portion out cereal from a big
box.;    For kid power;  Here are some child-friendly breakfast ideas. They're
easy enough for older kids to do themselves.;    (box) Make fruit and cheese
kebabs: Alternate cubes of cheese and fruit on small wooden skewers, wrap well
and refrigerate overnight.;    (box) Make your own trail mix and pack it into
little plastic bags or containers to eat on the way to school or work.;   
(box) For fun, make miniature muffins instead of regular size. If they're a
few days old, split and toast them, then spread with cream cheese.;    (box)
Remember, chocolate milk is not the worst thing in the world.;    (box) Frost
a banana with peanut butter, roll in crushed cereal, wrap and freeze. Yum.;   
(box) A sandwich for breakfast? Put together a cheese sandwich the night
before and quickly grill it in the morning.;    (box) Scoop yogurt into an ice
cream cone. Add sprinkles of wheat germ or raisins or a dollop of all-fruit
jam.;    (box) Along the same lines, dish up a breakfast parfait or banana
split. Recipes below.;    (box)  A breakfast ice-cream bar? Make them with
yogurt and fruit or fruit juice and fruit. Cold and yummy.;   BREAKFAST POPS; 
 1 8-ounce container yogurt;  1 small sliced banana;  1/2 cup sliced
strawberries or other fruit;   Stir fruit into yogurt, then spoon into paper
or plastic cups. Insert a ice-cream stick (or small plastic spoon) and freeze.
When firm, wrap in foil. Makes 2 small pops.; (hbox);    This recipe, which
goes together in about 5 minutes, is from an old Southern Living. Be careful
not to over-mix the batter; it doesn't have to be smooth. A crack in the top
of the loaf is normal; it's also normal for quick breads to look pretty flat,
not domed like yeast breads. (Low-cholesterol cooks could substitute 2 egg
whites for the beaten egg.);    I've also baked this as muffins (they're done
in about 25 minutes). Bread or muffins freeze well.;      APPLESAUCE-PECAN
BREAD;  2 cups all-purpose flour (or 1 1/2 cups flour and 1/2 cup wheat germ);
 1 tablespoon baking powder;  1/2 teaspoon baking soda;  1/2 teaspoon salt; 
3/4 cup sugar;  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon;  1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg; 
1/2 cup chopped pecans;  1/2 cup raisins;  1 egg, beaten;  1 cup applesauce
(or 1 cup mashed ripe banana or 1 cup canned pumpkin puree);  1/4 cup
vegetable oil;   Combine first 7 ingredients in a large bowl; stir in pecans
and raisins. Make a well in center of dry mixture. Combine egg, applesauce and
oil; add to dry ingredients, stirring just until moistened. Spoon mixture into
a greased and floured loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes or
until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pan 10
minutes; remove from pan, and let cool on a wire rack.; (hbox);    This is
from a baby and toddler cookbook called "Mommy Made (And Daddy, Too)" by
Martha and David Kimmel (1990, $13.95, Bantam trade paperback). It's good for
grown-ups as well.;  PEANUT BUTTER BANANARAMA SHAKE;  1 very ripe banana,
peeled and sliced;  2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter;  1 cup or more milk; 
2 ice cubes (or more);  1 teaspoon honey (optional);   Place all ingredients
in a blender and whirl until smooth. Add more milk if too thick. Serve soon or
banana will start to darken. Makes enough for 1 adult and 1 child or 2
toddlers.; (hbox);   BREAKFAST BANANA SPLIT;  1 small banana, sliced in half
lengthwise;  8 ounce carton vanilla yogurt;  2 tablespoons sliced strawberries
or raspberries;  2 tablespoons blueberries;  2 tablespoons crushed pineapple; 
2 tablespoons granola or chopped nuts;   If you have banana-split dishes, use
them. Otherwise, use a small oblong dish. Place banana halves on sides of
dish, then place yogurt in three scoops down center. Top each scoop with
fruit, then sprinkle with granola or nuts. Serve immediately. Makes 1
serving.;    Note: Try banana split with other flavors of yogurt and your
favorite fruits. How about lemon yogurt and chopped mangoes or peaches?;
(hbox);    These are easy enough for anyone to make. Wrap bars individually
and grab one on the way out the door when you're really in a rush. The recipe
is from Pillsbury.;     NO-BAKE GRANOLA BARS;  1/2 cup firmly packed brown
sugar;  1/2 cup light corn syrup; 1 cup peanut butter; 1 teaspoon vanilla; 1
1/2 cups quick-cooking rolled oats; 1 1/2 cups crisp rice cereal; 1 cup
raisins;  1/2 cup coconut;  1/2 cup sunflower seeds; 2 tablespoons sesame
seeds;   In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar and corn syrup. Bring to a
boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Stir in peanut butter and
vanilla; blend well. Add remaining ingredients and mix well. Press into
ungreased 9-inch-square pan. Cool, then cut into 20 bars.; (hbox);  TROPICAL
SHAKE;  2  tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate;  1 cup ginger ale or
skim milk;  2 tablespoons non-fat dry milk powder;   Handful of ice cubes; 
1/4 cup canned crushed pineapple;  2 tablespoons coconut;   Blend orange
juice, ginger ale or milk, and dry milk in blender until creamy. Add ice,
pineapple and coconut and blend again. Serve at once.;    Note: You can
substitute frozen pineapple juice concentrate and bananas for orange juice and
pineapple.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  VEGETABLE; RECIPE; SUMMER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Can't get your kids to eat vegetables? Perhaps you're not trying the right
ones. Consider watermelon. Yes, that big summer fruit is really a vegetable --
cousin to the cucumber and kin to a gourd.;    Here are some facts and tips on
watermelon:  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NO MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT,
WATERMELON IN MANY GUISES
GOES A LONG WAY
TO COOL OFF A SUMMER DAY
MIGHTY MELON  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Recipes of the Week  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     (box) Rich in vitamin C and potassium, watermelon has 50 calories per cup
and no fat or cholesterol.;    (box) When choosing a watermelon, some people
thump, some smell, some shake, some feel the rind. But one out of four
consumers rely on plain old luck to choose a ripe watermelon.;    (box) The
most reliable method is turn the melon over. If the underside is yellow and
the rind overall has a healthy sheen, the watermelon is probably ripe.;   
(box) Choose a watermelon that if free from dents, bruises and cuts. The skin
should be even, but several insect bites in the rind or marks left from the
vine won't affect the melon's flavor.;    (box) The watermelon should be heavy
for its size.;    (box) Never cook watermelon; cooking returns it to its
cucumber roots, losing texture and sweetness.;    (box) Don't chop watermelon
too finely or it will disintegrate when mixed with other ingredients.;   
(check) Store whole watermelon between 50 and 60 degrees for no more than two
weeks. Once cut and wrapped, watermelon slices should be kept chilled and
eaten within two days.;    (box) Don't wrap pre-cut slices too tightly, or the
flesh will become mushy.;    (box) Freezing also makes watermelon mushy and
mealy.;    (box) All watermelon stored more than two weeks loses its sugar
content and quality deteriorates.;  SUMMER PITA SANDWICH; 4 thin wedges seeded
watermelon; 1 cup diced cooked chicken; 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro; 2
tablespoons plain yogurt;  1/4 teaspoon garlic salt;  Dash cayenne pepper; 2
whole wheat pita breads, halved;  1/4 cup prepared spreadable herb cheese; 4
large lettuce leaves;   Place sliced watermelon on paper towels to remove
excess liquid. Mix chicken, cilantro, yogurt, garlic salt and cayenne. Spread

about 1/4 cup chicken mixture. Arrange watermelon and lettuce in pita bread.

<LEADPARA>  MEATLOAF, the quintessential back-to-basics food that was unspeakable during
most of the 1980s, is the perfect comfort food when times are tough.;    It's
inexpensive, simple and requires less time cleaning up in the kitchen than all
those 20- and 30-minute meals that sometimes take several bowls and a couple
of pans. Sure, meatloaf takes an hour or so to cook, but you can watch
television, read the newspaper or even take a catnap while you wait for it to
warm the kitchen and stir your memories.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MEATLOAF: JUST DUMP INTO A BOWL, SQUISH AND
BAKE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Everyone seems to be talking meatloaf these days -- from Jane and Michael
Stern, cookbook authors who have made a career of praising old-fashioned "mom"
food, to Sharon Moore, author of the recently released "Meatloaf" (Clarkson N.
Potter, $10.95).;    Michael Stern says even the name "meatloaf" is so
cloddish that it is disarming and can't help but win our hearts. Even its
preparation spells simpler times.;    "There's no really complicated recipe
for meatloaf," he says. "You just take the ingredients, dump them into a bowl,
squish them together and bake it. . . . Any idiot can make it. That's why it's
so comforting. You don't have to cut it and carve it. It's simple to eat. And
the taste of a classic meatloaf is quite homogenized. There are no
surprises.";    Moore has taken these basic principles and come up with 42
recipes that range from down-home classics like Granny's Meatloaf, made with
ground veal, pork and beef and topped with bacon, to imaginative versions like
the Blue Ribbon Loaf, flavored with Dijon mustard and blue cheese.;    Colleen
Pierre, national spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, suggests
grinding your own meat.;    "Normally when you buy ground meat it is a
combination of meat and fat ground together," she says. "If you would buy very
lean pork tenderloin or lean ground beef and grind it yourself, you could cut
the fat considerably.";    If you look for ground chicken or turkey, read the
label carefully, Pierre adds. For example, ground turkey can include a lot of
fatty turkey skin or can be a combination of white and dark meat. Look for
ground turkey breast, the leanest option.;    Even if you make the ingredients
more healthful, the psychological result remains the same as it was when you
came home from school and feasted on the comfort of Mom's meatloaf and mashed
potatoes, Moore says.;    "A lot of us went off to work and stopped cooking,"
she says. "The only time we cooked was during holidays and for fancy gourmet
dinners. "People are now cooking more often and they tend to want to prepare
what Mother made. You can't go home every day after a long day at work and
make beef Wellington or salmon en croute."; BLUE RIBBON LOAF;  2 large eggs; 1
tablespoon Dijon mustard;  1/4 cup port;  Salt (if desired) and freshly ground
black pepper to taste; 1 pound ground lean beef or veal; 1 pound ground lean
pork; 3 cups fine dry bread crumbs; 1 cup finely chopped onion;  1/4 pound
blue cheese, crumbled;  Red grapes, optional;   Preheat oven to 350. Beat the
eggs in a mixing bowl; blend in the mustard and port. Stir in the salt and
pepper (salt may not be necessary unless using processed blue cheese). Work in
the veal or beef, pork, bread crumbs and onion and blend thoroughly.;    Place
the mixture on a 24-inch-long piece of wax paper and press it into a
9-by-16-inch rectangle. Sprinkle the blue cheese evenly over the top, leaving
a margin of 1 1/2 inches on all sides. Carefully roll up the rectangle like a
jelly roll, sealing the outside seam and ends by pressing down firmly.;   
Transfer the roll to a buttered or oiled 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan by picking
up the wax paper and inverting it. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until firm.
Garnish with red grapes, if desired. Makes 6 to 8 servings.; -- From
"Meatloaf"; (hbox);     HERBED AND CRUSTED; TURKEY LOAF; 2 1/2 pounds ground
turkey;  1/4 pound thinly sliced cooked ham, finely chopped; 1 small shallot,
minced; 1 teaspoon salt;  1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper; 2 large
eggs, lightly beaten; 1 cup cooked rice;  1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg;
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley; 1 tablespoon minced fresh basil or 1
teaspoon dried;  1/2 teaspoon minced fresh sage, or a pinch of dried;  2/3 cup
light cream or half and half; 1 small garlic, bruised; 2 tablespoons plus
additional unsalted butter, softened;  1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs;  Dash hot
pepper sauce;  SAUCE:;  1/2 cup sour cream at room temperature;  Salt and
freshly ground black pepper;   Preheat oven to 350. Combine all the
ingredients through the light cream in a large bowl. Mix thoroughly.;    Rub a
shallow baking dish with butter. Rub the dish with the bruised garlic. Form
the turkey mixture into a loaf in the dish and lightly rub the loaf with
garlic. Mix the 2 tablespoons butter with the bread crumbs in a small bowl
until smooth. Add the hot pepper sauce and spread the crumbs carefully over
the loaf, making sure none fall into the dish. Bake 1 1/2 hours.;    Remove
the drippings (there will be only a small amount) from the dish and transfer
to a bowl. Cover the loaf loosely with foil; let stand 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
stir the sour cream into the drippings and season with salt and pepper to
taste. Serve on the side. Makes 6 to 8 servings.; -- From "As American as
Apple Pie" by Phillip Stephen Schulz (Simon &amp; Schuster, $19.95); (hbox);   
The following meatloaf recipe resulted from one of those nights when it was
too cold to go to the store and I was forced to create from what was already
in the pantry and refrigerator.;     CHAR'S STAY-AT-HOME COLD WEATHER
MEATLOAF;   1 pound lean ground beef;  1 pound lean ground pork;  2 eggs,
beaten;  1/4 cup Parmesan cheese;  1/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs;  1
tablespoon sun-dried tomato bits, available in gourmet stores;  2 plum
tomatoes, chopped, and 1 tablespoon juice from canned tomatoes;  1 tablespoon
fresh dill, chopped;  1 carrot, chopped fine;  1 medium yellow onion, chopped
fine;  1/2 teaspoon garlic powder;  1/2 teaspoon onion powder;   Salt and
pepper, to taste;  3 to 4 tablespoons tomato sauce or spaghetti sauce for
topping, optional;   Preheat oven to 375. Combine all the ingredients except
tomato sauce in a large bowl and mix well. Form the meatloaf in an oven-proof
rectangular casserole or a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan. Bake for 45 minutes to 1
hour until firm. About 15 minutes before the end of cooking, spread tomato or
spaghetti sauce in thin layer on top of meatloaf. Remove from oven and allow
to cool for 10 minutes. Makes 8 servings.;    Note: To minimize fat in the
meatloaf, pour off excess fat two or three times during cooking.;  Add health;
to tradition;  Sharon Moore's "Meatloaf" book gives advice for adapting some
of the recipes to meet the health concerns of the 1990s:; (box)  Instead of
ground beef or pork, use chicken, turkey, fish, low-fat cheese or tofu.; (box)
 Substitute low-fat bread and crackers, bran, corn bread, cooked rice,
potatoes, pastas or green beans for the bread or bread crumbs.;    (box) If
your doctor has limited your intake of eggs, use two egg whites for each whole
egg called for in the recipe.; (box)  Liquid ingredients could include low-fat
or skim milk, low-fat yogurt, defatted homemade chicken, beef or veal stock or
liquid from cooking vegetables.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Forget the shelves full of cookbooks. Our favorite recipes as kids were those
our mothers cut from cereal boxes and soup labels. Moms liked them too,
because they were easy to prepare and often called for ingredients already on
hand. Today, those old favorites may be real godsends for working moms and
dads. For those who don't have time to clip recipes from boxes, or fondly
remember a recipe no longer on Campbell's soup cans, chef and cookbook author
Michael McLaughlin has written "The Back of the Box Gourmet" (Simon &amp;
Schuster, $14.95), a collection of more than 75 recipes from Lipton California
Dip to Toll-House Cookies. These samples from the book are sure to trigger
pleasant memories.  </LEADPARA>

cookie sheets.;   In a large bowl, beat butter with electric mixer on high
speed until creamy. Add the brown sugar, granulated sugar, then egg, beating
until light yellow and creamy.;   In small bowl, stir together flour, soda,
salt, cinnamon and nutmeg; stir into butter mixture. Stir in oats, raisins,
walnuts and vanilla. Roll into balls, then in additional granulated sugar, if
desired. Place on cookie sheets, flattening cookies slightly. Bake 10 minutes
or until lightly browned. Let stand 2 minutes on cookie sheet; remove to wire
rack to cool. Store in tightly sealed container.;   Makes about 9 dozen 2-inch
cookies.;  FRESH CATCH; 1 cup pecans or walnuts; 1/2 cup all-purpose flour;
1/4 cup yellow cornmeal; 1 teaspoon baking powder;  Salt and pepper; 2 whole
brook trout, about 12 ounces each, cleaned, heads and tails left on; 1/2 cup
milk or water; 6 tablespoons peanut or other vegetable oil;  Fresh lemon
slices;  Place pecans, flour, cornmeal and baking powder in food processor;
process until fine. Place mixture in well-sealed food container and take to
campsite.;   About 20 minutes before serving, salt and pepper each trout or
other catch of the day. Dip in milk, then dredge the outsides plus the inside
cavities of the fish with pecan mixture, pressing lightly to coat well. Heat
oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute the fish about 8 minutes,
until crisp and golden, turning once. Garnish with lemon slices. Makes 2
servings.;  FRUIT LEATHER; 2 cups fruit; 2 teaspoons lemon juice; 1/2 cup corn
syrup or honey;  Select ripe or slightly overripe fruit. Wash in cool water;
remove peel, seeds and stem. Cut fruit into chunks. Puree fruit until smooth.;
  Add lemon juice and sweetener.;   Line a 13-by-15-inch cookie pan with edges
with plastic wrap, being sure to smooth out wrinkles. Do not use waxed paper
or aluminum foil. Pour puree into a single large sheet. Spread puree evenly,
about 1/8-inch thick. Avoid pouring puree too close to the edge of the cookie
sheet.;   Approximate drying times are: 6 to 8 hours in a dehydrator, up to 18
hours in a 140-degree oven and 1 to 2 days in the sun. Test for dryness by
touching center of leather; no indention should be evident. While warm, peel
from plastic and roll, allow to cool and rewrap the roll in plastic.;   Fruit
leather will keep up to 1 month at room temperature; up to 1 year wrapped
tightly and frozen.;  GRANOLA BARS; 4 1/2 cups rolled oats; 1/2 teaspoon salt;

ingredients. Pour over meat slices; thoroughly wet all sides of meat with
marinade and layer in the marinating dish.;   Cover tightly and marinate in
refrigerator overnight or from 6 to 12 hours. For best results rotate meat
layers every few hours until ready to dry.;   To dry: After marinating jerky,
dry in your dehydrator at 140 to 160 degrees for the first 4 hours, then you
may reduce heat to 130 degrees until dry. For oven drying, heat should be 140
to 160 degrees for about 8 hours, then lower to 130 degrees till dry. You can
also dry jerky in the oven at a constant temperature of 150 degrees for 10
hours, but you'll get better results with the other two methods. Makes about
1/2 pound jerky.;   Note: You may want to partially freeze the meat first to
make cutting easier. Cut strips 3 inches or longer by about 1-inch wide and
1/4-inch thick. Cut across the grain for more tender jerky, with the grain for
tougher, chewy strips. Some people like to cut jerky in paper-thin sheets.;
CURRIED LENTIL SOUP BASE; 3 to 4 cups water; 2 14 1/2-ounce cans chicken
broth; 2 cups lentils; 1 fresh onion, diced; 3 cloves garlic,minced; 1
tablespoon grated ginger; 4 teaspoon curry powder; 2 teaspoon ground
coriander; 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes; 1 tablespoon olive oil;  At home:
Bring water, chicken broth and lentils to boil, reduce heat, and cover. Simmer

watching and add more water if too thick, but as little as possible. Cook
onion, garlic, ginger, curry, coriander, and pepper in oil over medium heat 7
minutes. Stir spice mixture into lentils. Cover. Cook over medium-low heat 20
minutes. Cook down to thick paste, taking care not to burn.;   Spread on
plastic sheets in a dehydrator. Dry at 145 degrees until dehydrated, about 6
hours. Or, dry in an oven on a cookie sheet at 130-150 degrees. (Turn oven on
lowest setting with door propped open. Use an oven thermometer to make sure
oven maintains steady temperature. Rotate food and remove as it becomes dry.)
Repackage and store in refrigerator until ready to use.;   In Camp: Rehydrate
with boiling water until desired thickness.;   -- This and the following two;

Bring to room temperature before baking or serving. Serve in baking dishes or
on platter. Garnish with cilantro leaves and lime wedges. Serves 8.; 
BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE SAUCE; Lavish;  8  ounces imported bittersweet
chocolate, broken in pieces;  1 cup whipping cream;   Pinch of salt;  2
teaspoons vanilla;   Place chocolate in top of a double boiler and set over
very hot, but not boiling, water. Stir until chocolate is melted. In a small
saucepan, scald cream over medium heat; blend into chocolate along with salt,
whisking until smooth and shiny. Beat in a little hot water or additional
cream for a thinner consistency, if desired. Remove sauce from heat and stir
in vanilla. Serve warm or at room temperature. If prepared ahead, cool, cover
and refrigerate as long as several weeks; sauce will harden when chilled.;   
To serve, return to room temperature and reheat over hot water until
liquefied; or place container in a saucepan filled with very hot, but not
boiling, water. To further thin sauce, beat in hot cream or hot water, 1
tablespoon at a time. Makes 2 cups.;    Note: This sauce and the lean version
opposite are ideal for fruit fondue, a lovely summer dessert.;  BITTERSWEET
CHOCOLATE; SAUCE; Lean;  1 cup powdered sugar;  1 cup unsweetened cocoa;  1
tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch;  1/4 teaspoon salt, if desired;  2 cups
enriched non-fat milk, or non-fat milk;  2 teaspoons vanilla;   Sift powdered
sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt, if desired, into a small saucepan. Slowly
whisk in 1 cup milk until mixture is well blended. Stir in remaining 1 cup
milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sauce bubbles.
Reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and
blend in vanilla.;    Serve warm or at room temperature; if serving tepid or
cool, stir frequently to prevent a skin from forming. If prepared ahead, cool,
cover and refrigerate up to 2 days; to cover, gently press plastic wrap
directly onto surface of cooled sauce. Return to room temperature or reheat
over hot water, stirring, before serving. Makes about 2 1/2 cups.; Note:
Cornstarch helps to emulsify or suspend the cocoa particles in liquid; without
such a thickener, the cocoa would settle to the bottom. Lecithin is often used
as an emulsifier in commercial sauces. If Dutch-processed cocoa is available,
use it; it has a rich, mellow flavor. You can adjust the sauce's consistency
by using more or less cornstarch.;  COLD BEEF &amp; GARLIC SALAD; Lavish;   About
5 cups 1/2-inch cubes of cooked beef brisket (3 pounds uncooked); 2 pounds
boiling potatoes, boiled, peeled, cut in 1/2-inch dice; 8 hard-cooked eggs,

romaine lettuce and Boston or butter lettuce, washed, dried, torn in bite-size
pieces;  Dressing; 1 1/2 cups mayonnaise;  1/4 cup Dijon-style mustard;  5
garlic cloves, pressed;  1/2 cup each fresh lemon juice and extra-virgin olive
oil;   Prepare dressing. Toss beef, potatoes, eggs, green onions and parsley
in a large salad bowl. Add dressing; toss salad until ingredients are well
coated. Season with salt, pepper, lemon juice and mustard. Cover and
refrigerate at least 3 hours or until flavors are blended. Return salad to
room temperature. Just before serving, gently toss salad with lettuce.;   
Serve salad from bowl onto large individual plates. Makes 8 servings.;
Dressing: In a small bowl, mix all ingredients until blended. Makes about 2
3/4 cups.;  COLD BEEF &amp; GARLIC SALAD; Lean;   About 5 cups 1/2-inch cubes of
cooked top round roast (3 pounds uncooked);  1 cup 1/2-inch cubes of boiled,
peeled potatoes;   Whites of 10 hard-cooked eggs, coarsely chopped;  2 bunches
(about 12) green onions, finely sliced;  1/2 cup each flat-leaf parsley and

<DESCRIPT>  FOOD; RECIPE; HOLIDAY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE candy corn and candy wrappers of Halloween have barely faded from sight
and yet my mind races to the preparations for the holiday season ahead.;   One
way I can got a handle on this time of year is to make foods that are great
for storing and using in a holiday menu or giving as gifts that will be
happily received. Glittering Walnuts will disappear like magic when served as
a nibble with a glass of sherry or champagne. Pack them in an airtight faceted
apothecary jar, tie a plaid ribbon around the neck and you have a fabulous
gift.  </LEADPARA>

CULINARY SOS: GRILLED CHICKEN WITH THE HOT, SPICY TASTE OF JAMAICA

<P>
DEAR SOS: Do you happen to have a recipe for Jerk Chicken that you'd find in 
Jamaican restaurants? Love to have it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CLAIRE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CLAIRE: Super idea for Thanksgiving turkey too. Meanwhile, here is the 
recipe for Jamaican Jerk Chicken taken from the Summer 1989 issue of a new 
quarterly ($10.95 for four issues) called "The Whole Chile Pepper," which one 
can subscribe to by writing to Whole Chile Pepper, Out West Publishing, P.O. 
Box 4278, Albuquerque, N. M. 87196. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the recipe is the chile paste used to brush on the chicken. The 
recipe calls for brands of chile salsa, such as 1/4 cup of Inner Beauty or 
other Caribbean hot sauce. You can also buy 10 Scotch Bonnet chiles (Harbanero 
chiles said to be the hottest in the world) and puree them with 1/4 cup yellow 
mustard for the proper effect. Harbanero chiles can sometimes be found in fresh 
form in Mexican and Caribbean markets. If not available, use any hot chile. 
</P>
<P>
According to the chile article, jerk meat dishes were originally created by 
maroons (escaped slaves) in Jamaica, as a method of preserving pork by rubbing 
it with a chile paste then open pit smoking the meat. Pork evolved into 
chicken, which is also rubbed with the same chile mixture but slow-grilled so 
that it develops a rather dried out crusty top, similar to smoked meat.

<LEADPARA>  READER Lorie Mascar of San Jose has hit the jackpot. Mascar requested two
recipes: one for a thick teriyaki sauce; another for lemon bars made with a
cake mix and cream cheese. It didn't take long for the recipes to roll in.;  
"I've cooked Oriental food all my life," writes Donna Fanning  of San Jose.
"Teriyaki is a personal thing. While the basis stays pretty much the same,
there can be many variations. I don't thicken my sauce, but the sauce can be
thickened easily with these directions."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  TERIYAKI; 3/4 cup soy sauce; 3/4 cup white sugar; 2 cloves garlic, pressed or
minced; 1 1-inch piece of ginger root, peeled, sliced length-wise then sliced
into slivers; Peel grated from 1 lemon; Cornstarch; Water;  Put soy sauce;
sugar, garlic, ginger and lemon peel in a non-aluminum saucepan and bring to a
boil. Be careful not to let it boil over. Turn down heat and simmer for 8
minutes. In a bowl, combine a couple of tablespoons cornstarch with about a
1/2 cup cold water. Mixture should look milky. With the sauce at a high
simmer, dribble in the cornstarch, a little at a time, from a gravy ladle
while stirring the mixture constantly with a wooden spoon until you reach the
consistency you desire. Let it simmer a minute or two more before removing it
from the heat.; (hbox);   Trish Seaman of Cupertino sends this sauce recipe.
It can be stored for several months in the refrigerator, she says.; TOMI'S
TERIYAKI SAUCE; 1 1/2 cups soy sauce; 1 1/2  cups brown sugar; 4 tablespoons
ketchup; 2 tablespoons mirin, Japanese wine; 1/4 teaspoon Lawry's seasoning
salt; 1/4 teaspoon pepper; 5 to 6 peeled cloves of garlic; 1 teaspoon MSG
(optional); 1/8 teaspoon onion powder;  Mix all ingredients together in
saucepan. Stir and heat just to a simmer. Do not boil. Remove from heat and
cool.; A bit of lemon; Here are a few versions of lemon bars for Mascar.
Billie Schmitz  of Sunnyvale and Phyllis Marsh  of San Jose contributed this
version.; LEMON CHEESE-BARS; 1 package yellow cake mix, with pudding added; 2
eggs, divided; 1/3 cup vegetable oil; 1 8-ounce package cream cheese,
softened; 1/3 cup sugar; 1 teaspoon lemon juice;  Mix cake mix, 1 egg and
vegetable oil until crumbly. Reserve 1 cup of the mixture. Pat remaining
mixture in a 13-by-9-by-2-inch pan. Bake 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Beat cream
cheese, sugar, lemon juice and 1 egg until smooth. Spread over baked layer.
Sprinkle with reserved cake mixture and bake 15 minutes longer. Cool and cut
into bars.; (hbox);   This quick and simple version is from Elaine Hoger  of
Saratoga.; LEMON BARS; 1 one step angel food cake mix; 1 can lemon pie
filling; 1 can cream cheese frosting;  Mix cake mix and lemon pie filling
together and spread in a 10-by-15-inch jelly-roll pan that has been well
greased and floured. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Cool and frost with
cream cheese frosting. Cut into bars.; (hbox);   Marie Mitchell of San Jose
printed a big "Yummy!" at the top of her recipe. It doesn't use a cake mix or
cream cheese but it does look yummy.; LEMON BARS; 1 cup butter; 1/2 cup
powdered sugar; 1/4 teaspoon salt; 2 1/4 cups flour, divided; 2 eggs; 2 cups
granulated sugar; 1/4 cup lemon juice; 1 teaspoon grated lemon rind;  Cream
butter, powdered sugar and salt. Stir in 2 cups flour. Press mixture over
bottom of 9- by-13-inch pan. Bake at 325 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes. Do not
overbake. Beat eggs; add granulated sugar and remaining 1/4 cup flour, lemon
juice and rind. Spread over baked mixture. Continue baking for 23 to 25
minutes with additional powdered sugar sprinkled on top, if desired.; Calls
for help; "Recently, I purchased some cinnamon cookies in Mendocino," writes
Joyce Kiefer  of Sunnyvale. "I would like to make similar cookies for
Christmas. They were drop cookies with the cinnamon inside the dough but they
were not snickerdoodles.";   Annette McSheffrey  of Cupertino wants a recipe
for a waffle mix that will keep for several days in the refrigerator.;   Betty
Mitre  of San Jose is looking for a recipe for Pumpkin-Apple Pie. She was told
it had pumpkin filling on the top and apple filling on the bottom and was
delicious.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  OKLAHOMA; FOOD; HISTORY; BOOK; REVIEW; RECIPE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  BY THE time Oklahoma became a state in 1907, the cooking of this expansive
land was as colorful and complex as a crazy quilt.;   Its rich flavors
reflected the heritages of the people who settled here -- the European
immigrants who came to farm or to work the coal mines; the cowboys and
ranchers who ventured in from other Southwestern states; the educated Yankees
who came to teach, to bank or to practice law or medicine; the former slaves
who came seeking freedom; and the Indians who had been here all along.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TASTEFUL MEMORIES OF EARLY OKLAHOMA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Everyone who came helped season the state's cookery, which evolved into a
curious combination of international and regional cuisines -- Czechoslovakian,
German, Spanish, French, Belgian, Irish, Greek, Mexican, American Indian,
Cajun and Creole, and New England.;   The food of Oklahoma has been a course
of study for Linda Kennedy Rosser, an enthusiastic cook and writer. For more
than a decade, Rosser has hunted for recipes and reminiscences of her state's
turn-of-the-century cooking. Her book "Pioneer Cookery Around Oklahoma"
(Bobwhite Publications), written for the Oklahoma Science and Arts Museum,
combines recipes, family stories, historical anecdotes and warm memories of
days gone by.;   All the recipes and many of the anecdotes are printed just as
Rosser found them, so that the words of the pioneers could tell their own
story.;   The recipes tell how to cook squirrel, prepare potted venison, broil
quail and make sourdough. There are recipes for bean pie, beef stew, cornmeal
cakes, sugar cookies and dainty pastries.;   The stories Rosser found in
diaries and heard from the pioneers' grandchildren tell of the hardships the
settlers faced and the pleasures they knew. The same stories reveal the joys
that innovative cooks brought to their lives, even in the dreariest of times.;
INDIAN JACK; 1 cup chopped green pepper; 1 cup chopped onions; 2 medium
tomatoes, peeled and chopped; 1 tablespoon sugar; 1 teaspoon salt;  Pepper to
taste; 1/2 cup vinegar; 1/2 cup cold water;  At least 3 hours before serving,

1 small green pepper, chopped; 2 cloves garlic, minced; 3 tablespoons brown
sugar; 2 teaspoons chili powder; 1 teaspoon dry mustard; 1/4 teaspoon dried
oregano;  Salt to taste;  Rinse beans. Combine beans with 6 cups water in
large pan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Cover and let stand 1 hour. Drain beans. Rinse and drain again. Return to
saucepan. Add remaining 2 1/2 cups water. Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours or
until tender. Brown salt pork in skillet and add to beans. Stir in remaining
ingredients. Simmer, uncovered, 1 hour. Makes 12 servings.; CORNMEAL BISCUITS;
1 1/2 cups flour; 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal; 2 teaspoons baking powder; 1/4

green chili peppers, undrained;  Stir together flour, cornmeal, baking powder,
baking soda and salt. Cut in butter until mixture is coarse and crumbly. Stir
in cheese. Make well in center of mixture and set aside.;   Stir together
buttermilk and undrained chili peppers. Add buttermilk mixture all at once to
dry mixture and stir just until moistened.;   Turn dough out onto lightly
floured surface. Quickly knead dough by gently folding and pressing it, about
10 to 12 times or until nearly smooth. Pat dough to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut
with floured 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, dipping cutter into flour between
cuts.;   Place biscuits on ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees 12 to
15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve hot with butter. Makes 10 to 12.;
SPICED MARBLE CAKE; 1 cup butter or margarine; 2 cups sugar; 4 eggs; 3 cups
flour; 1 tablespoon baking powder; 1 cup milk; 1 teaspoon vanilla; 3
tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder; 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon; 1/4 teaspoon
ground allspice; 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg;  Dash ground cloves;  Dash ground
mace;  Beat together butter and sugar in large mixer bowl until light and
fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir
together flour and baking powder. Add flour mixture alternately with milk to
butter mixture, beating after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Spoon one-third
of batter into medium mixing bowl. Stir in cocoa, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg,
cloves and mace.;   Spoon half of plain mixture into well-greased 10-inch tube
pan. Spoon in chocolate mixture, then remaining plain mixture. Swirl gently
with knife to marble batters. Bake at 350 degrees about 45 minutes or until
tester inserted near center comes out clean. Cool on wire rack 10 minutes.
Loosen sides of cake and remove from pan. Cool thoroughly on wire rack. Makes
16 servings.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Obviously, beluga caviar and lobster puffs are out of the question for the
annual holiday hoedown. But don't reach for the Spam and saltines just yet.
There are other low-cost options.;   Start with about 30 friends and add a
Mexican fondue with tortilla chips. Save some of the chips for a spicy, hot
black bean dip.;   Throw in an elegant salmon spread and a robust potted
cheese spread flavored with beer. Round things out with a spicy Asian peanut
dunk for chicken wings and an unusual African-inspired curry dip with sweet
potato fries.;   The cost: About $40.;   The quantities the recipes make will
serve about 30. If you invite more or fewer people, use the rules of thumb
suggested by Susan Wyler in her book, "Cooking for a Crowd." Offer at least
five hors d'oeuvres at a cocktail party and plan on two to three tidbits and
about 1/4 cup of spread per guest.; OVEN-BAKED WINGS WITH SPICY PEANUT DIP; 3

drumettes (about 60 pieces);  In a blender or food processor, combine garlic,
peanut butter, sugar, ginger and jalapeno. Blend well. Add water and soy
sauce, and when well mixed, add lemon juice, cilantro and sesame oil. Makes
about 1 3/4 cups. Immediately before serving, place wings in a single layer on
jelly roll pans (baking sheets with sides). Bake at 400 degrees for 20 to 30
minutes, depending on size of chicken pieces. Serve warm, with peanut dip for

seeds; 3 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro; 2 chopped ripe tomatoes; 2
tablespoon pickled jalapeno pepper slices; Sour cream; Corn tortilla chips; 
Saute onion and garlic in olive oil until softened, then sprinkle with chili
powder and cook a minute longer. Drain liquid from one can of black beans and
add beans to pan. Add second can, undrained. Cook down to a thickened mixture,
mashing the beans slightly as they cook so mixture is partly smooth, partly
chunky. Season to taste with salt and cayenne.;   Spoon bean mixture into a
glass pie pan or rustic ceramic casserole. Recipe can be made ahead to this
point and refrigerated. When ready to serve, top beans with sliced cheese and
sprinkle with cumin seeds. Bake at 450 degrees for about 10 minutes, until
cheese melts and lightly browns. Serve immediately, garnished with cilantro,
tomatoes, jalapeno slices and sour cream. Scoop up with tortilla chips. Makes

juices.;   Remove from marinade, scrape off dill and seasonings and pat dry
with paper towels. Put fillets on cutting board, skin side down. Slice very
thin slices on the diagonal, omitting skin. Serve with mustard-dill sauce
(recipe follows) on one of several Scandinavian breads.; MUSTARD-DILL SAUCE; 4
tablespoons Dijon mustard, at room temperature; 1 teaspoon dry mustard; 3
tablespoons sugar; 2 tablespoons white vinegar; 1/3 cup vegetable oil; 3

days. Shake well before using. Makes 3/4 cup.; (hbox); PICKLED CUCUMBER SALAD;
2 8-inch cucumbers; 1 tablespoon salt; 3/4 cup white vinegar; 1 tablespoon
sugar; 1 teaspoon salt; 1/4 teaspoon white pepper; 2 tablespoons fresh,
chopped dill;  Scrub off any wax coating from cucumbers and dry them. Score
lengthwise with a fork. Slice as thin as possible. Arrange slices in a
colander. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt and put a shallow bowl over them
weighted down to extract moisture. Remove after an hour. Pat cucumbers with
paper towels and put in shallow bowl. Mix remaining ingredients and pour over
cucumbers. Cover and chill 2-3 hours. Drain slightly before serving. Serves
4.; (hbox); PORK LOIN WITH FIGS; 6 medium or 3 large fresh figs, cut in half,

and pepper and rub in any leftover marinade.;   Bake in a 350-degree oven
about 1 hour 10 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 155
degrees. Remove and cool. Cut into 1/2 to 3/4-inch slices, each showing a cut
fig in the center. Serves 6.; (hbox); BEET AND ORANGE SALAD; 1 16-ounce can
sliced beets; 1 medium orange; 1/4 cup thinly sliced sweet onions; 1/4
teaspoon ground cloves; 3 tablespoons each orange juice and cider vinegar;
Salt and white pepper to taste;  Drain beets and set aside. Peel and slice
orange into thin rounds. Arrange beet and orange slices on a platter
alternately. Spread onion slices on top. Mix remaining ingredients and pour
over. Refrigerate until ready to use. Serves 4.; (hbox); HERRING SALAD; 1
12-ounce jar wine-marinated herring; 1 hard-boiled egg, finely chopped; 1
small tart apple, finely chopped; 1/4 cup finely chopped onion; 1 teaspoon
sugar;  Finely chop herring and mix with remaining ingredients. Let sit at
least an hour for flavors to develop. Spread on one of several Scandinavian
breads or crackers.; (hbox); SWEDISH JELLY SLICES; 2 1/4 cups sifted
all-purpose flour; 1/2 teaspoon double-acting baking powder; 1/4 teaspoon
salt; 6 ounces butter; 2 teaspoons vanilla extract; 2/3 cup sugar; 1 egg;
3/4-1 cup apricot preserves or any thick, tart jam or jelly; 2 1/2 ounces
almonds, blanched and finely sliced; 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar; 2 tablespoons
boiling water;  Adjust oven rack one third down from top. (If using two cookie
sheets -- see below -- adjust second rack one third from bottom as well.)
Preheat to 375 degrees. Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Set
aside. In large bowl of an electric mixer, cream butter. Add vanilla and sugar
and beat well. Beat in egg. On lowest speed, add dry ingredients, scraping
bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat until well mixed. Turn out onto a lightly
floured board. Shape into a ball and cut into 4 equal parts.;   With your
fingertips, work each piece into a roll about 12 inches long and 1 inch in
diameter. Place rolls crossways on a large, unbuttered cookie sheet about 14
by 16 inches (or lengthwise on two smaller cookie sheets). Leave 2-3 inches
between them. Make a narrow trench down length of each roll with your finger.
Don't make too deep. Leave space at the ends. Fill trenches with preserves
(filling should be level or slightly higher than the sides). Sprinkle with
almonds.;   Bake about 25 minutes until cookies are sandy colored on top and
golden brown around the edges. Turn pan during baking to ensure even color.
(If using two pans, switch top and bottom positions halfway through baking.)
Shortly before removing cookies from oven, make glaze by mixing powdered sugar
and water to consistency of heavy cream.;   Remove cookie sheets from oven and
pour over or spoon glaze down length of each roll. Slide rolls onto large rack
to cool about 5 minutes. Carefully transfer to cutting board and, with a sharp
and heavy knife, cut each roll on an angle into slices about 1 to 1 1/4-inches
wide. Replace cookies on rack to finish cooling. Makes 42-48.; -- from "Maida

RECIPES REINFORCE L. A.'S CROSS-CULTURAL APPROACH TO CUISINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GILLINGHAM, Gillingham is a Los Angeles-based food writer and stylist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Think America is the melting pot of the world? Then Los Angeles must be its 
salad bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos, Asians and Europeans, Easterners, Southerners and other Americans from 
every direction are tossed together into a show of colors that is reflected in 
the way we have learned to cook and eat. 
</P>
<P>
And as comfortable as we have become with crossing cultures in the kitchen, we 
as easily amalgamate our seasons. Between our climate and the availability of 
produce from all over the world, we are as able to eat red-ripe strawberries, 
golden peaches, peppers and potatoes of unimaginable colors and crisp green 
salads in January as we are in June. 
</P>
<P>
A few cross-cultural, multiseasonal salads in point are illustrated here. One 
mixes Japanese with French, in another Thai mingles with Mexican. A New York 
steak sandwich is turned into a salad with an Italian influence and Waldorf 
salad becomes well-traveled with the addition of smoked turkey, 
California-grown Asian pears and Roquefort cheese. Any of them would make a 
fine main dish for a simple holiday meal that will celebrate our complexion, 
climate and crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
STEAK SANDWICH SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1 pound New York or sirloin steak, cut 3/4- to 1-inch thick 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper

1 small wedge Parmesan cheese, optional 
</P>
<P>
Broil or grill steak to desired doneness. Cool, then wrap in plastic and chill. 
</P>
<P>
Brush baguette slices with olive oil on both sides. Arrange in single layer on 
baking sheet. Toast in oven at 350 degrees 3 to 5 minutes per side or just 
until golden. Cool. (Can be made 1 day ahead and stored in paper bag.) 
</P>
<P>
When ready to assemble salads, carve steak into slices about 1/4-inch thick. On 
each of 4 dinner plates, arrange few arugula leaves, steak slices, 3 baguette 
slices, about 2 tablespoons Mustard Mayonnaise (reserve remaining mayonnaise 
for another use) and 1/4 of Onion Marmalade. Season steak to taste with salt 
and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
With vegetable peeler, shave off curls of Parmesan cheese and scatter over 
steak. To eat, spread some of Mustard Mayonnaise on baguette slice. Top with 
some of arugula, steak slices, cheese and onion marmalade. Makes 4 servings.

   Clothes may make the man, but his tie can reveal
his innermost secrets.
   The color, pattern and style of a man's necktie all provide
clues to his personality and lifestyle, says the Guild of British
Tiemakers, representing 30 manufacturers of ``the British tie,''
that sartorial symbol of the Old Boy Network.
   ``As eyes are reputedly the mirrors of the soul, so ties are the
talisman of the image, a statement by the wearer of their
personality and individuality, an indication of their temperament
and mood, a symbol of the social set in which he does or wants to
belong, a guide to how the wearer sees himself or would like others
to see him,'' according to the guild's survey.
   To help tie wearers and watchers interpret some of the subtle
messages, the guild has issued a guide to ``tiespeak.''
   ``If you want to come across as a strong, confident extrovert
person with strong opinions, choose a brilliantly colored tie or
one with an exaggerated pattern or motif,'' it says.
   ``A man who wears a tie in a plain light color runs the danger
of being a professional Mr. Nice, someone who likes to amuse and
entertain, an arranger of matters rather than a doer.''
   The ``more glowing'' the color of a tie, the more
money-motivated the wearer is likely to be, the guide says. A plain
dark tie, on the other hand, indicates a secretive man who keeps
more than his tie close to his chest.
   The guide says a tie with light and dark stripes of equal width
is the mark of a fence-sitter.
   Wide, light stripes on a dark background suggest the wearer
thinks the best of people and accepts them at face value, while
pessimists generally go for wide, dark stripes on a light
background.
   Multicolored, multiwidth stripes indicate someone who'd love to
do something daring _ if only he dared.
   A striped tie also can blurt out which side of the Atlantic
Ocean a man hails from. American tie stripes run from the right
shoulder down toward the left, the opposite of those on a European
tie.
   A tie with dark spots on a light background indicates ``a
wheeler-dealer,'' while light spots on a dark background suggest
``a sheep in wolf's clothing,'' the guide says.
   ``Small, neat geometric patterns are taken to indicate a
planner, a man who likes to create order out of chaos, probably a
good administrator,'' it says.
   A small paisley pattern suggests an upholder of tradition, while
a large paisly print suggests a hedger of bets.
   Ties give away other secrets.
   In Britain, a man's personal history can be traced through the
ties in his closet, revealing his school, club and military
background.
   Every British school has its own design, usually striped with
the school colors, which every schoolboy wears as part of his
uniform.
   Upon graduation he moves up to an ``Old School Tie,''
identifying his alma mater. He also may collect a regimental tie,
with symbolic colors and crests.
   The colors of the Royal Military Academy's tie, for example,
represent the ingredients of gunpowder _ yellow for sulphur, blue
for saltpeter and black for carbon. The Royal Tank Corps tie
represents the brown mud, red blood and green fields of Flanders,
the World War I battlefield.

<LEADPARA>  WE ALL customize recipes to suit our own tastes. When readers reply to recipe
requests, the range of ingredients for what is supposedly the same recipe is
often astounding -- and informative.;    Take bread pudding, for instance.
When Lynn Younger of San Jose requested a recipe for a bread pudding that her
family could pick up and eat like cookies, three San Jose readers were quick
to reply. Loretta Del Carlo sent a recipe for old-fashioned bread pudding,
Olga Flores, a Mexican-style version; and Kathy Quesada, a Creole pudding.
Same recipe? Well, not quite. Here's the old-fashioned version followed by
notes on the two variations.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BREAD PUDDING GOES BEYOND BASIC  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Readers' Exchange  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  OLD-FASHIONED BREAD; PUDDING; 3 eggs;  3/4 cups sugar, half white, half brown;
1 teaspoon vanilla; 1 teaspoon cinnamon;  3/4 stick margarine, melted; 5 cups
old bread, cubed;  3/4 cup raisins that have been rinsed in boiling water; 1
quart milk, scalded;   Beat eggs. Add sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and margarine,
mix. Add bread and raisins, mix. Add scaled milk. Mix well and add more milk
if needed. Place in 13-by-9-inch baking dish and bake at 350 degrees for 45
minutes to an 1 hour. Test for doneness with a toothpick.;    VARIATIONS:;   
(box) In the Mexican version, ingredients are: 1 large loaf of stale French
bread torn into pieces, 1 to 1 1/2 quarts milk, 1 cup sugar, 4 eggs, 1/4 stick
margarine, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 3/4 cup raisins and 1 2-ounce package of
sliced almonds. Soak the bread 1 to 1 1/2 hours in the milk and then drained
before adding the remaining ingredients. Baking dish, oven temperature and
cooking time remain the same.;    (box) The Creole version uses 1 loaf sour
French bread, 1 quart milk, 3 eggs, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla, 1
teaspoon grated lemon rind and 1/2 teaspoon ground mace. Soak the bread in
milk and mash until well mixed before adding the remaining ingredients. Baking
dish, oven temperature and cooking time remain the same.; Florida treat; Marty
Eige and Sandy Robnett, both of San Jose, sent this recipe for Mrs. E. W. Wade
of San Jose who wants to make Key Lime Pie. Eige notes that bottled Key Lime
juice can be purchased in some local stores. A good substitute, she writes, is
the Meyer lemon.;  KEY LIME PIE; 4 eggs, separated; 1 can sweetened condensed
milk;  1/2 cup lime juice; 6 tablespoons sugar;  1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar;
1 baked pie shell;   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Beat egg yolks. Add
condensed milk and lime juice. Beat until thick. Beat 1 egg white until stiff
and fold into mixture. Pour into baked pie shell. For topping, beat 3 egg
whites blending in the sugar and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form.
Spread over top of pie filling. Bake for 20 minutes or until egg whites are
golden brown.; Chewy and sweet; Dolores Corral of Campbell requested a recipe
for chewy fruit bar cookies. Christy Baker of San Jose sends this recipe.;
LEMON BARS; 1 cup margarine;  1/2 cup powdered sugar; 2 cups plus 5
tablespoons flour, divided; 4 eggs; 2 cups granulated sugar; 6 tablespoons
lemon juice; 1 teaspoon baking powder;   Mix margarine, powdered sugar and 2
cups flour until fluffy. Spread in 9-by-13-inch baking pan and pat down. Bake
at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.;    Beat eggs, granulated sugar, lemon juice,
baking powder and 5 tablespoons flour together. Pour over cooled crust. Bake
at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. When cool, sprinkle with additional powdered
sugar, if desired.; Calls for help; Olga Flores of San Jose  visited Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, and tasted tortilla soup. It was great, she wrote, and she
would like a recipe for the soup, which includes beans, sliced tortillas and a
tomato base.;    "We are a soup-and-sandwich family all year round," writes
Priscilla Hosman of San Jose. She says she has tried many minestrone soup
recipes but none taste as good as that at Adolph's in Santa Cruz. Can anyone
supply that recipe?  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  WHEN "visions of sugarplums dance in your head" this holiday season, you might
want to make them dance on your table with one of the winning recipes from the
annual Mission Peak Heritage Foundation's Victorian Dessert Faire Contest.
Held at Fremont's historic Shinn House on Sept. 15, the Dessert Faire
attracted more than 25 entrants. Vying for the honor of winning
Victorian-style prize ribbons, participants baked up desserts that were judged
in four categories: pies, cakes, cookies and pastries.;   It takes a
discerning palate to withstand tasting so many sweets in one session. If you
are not careful, everything begins to taste the same. Dessert Faire organizer,
Sherry Niswonger, put together a team of judges with taste buds potent enough
to weather the sugary onslaught. Tom Blalock, head of Fremont Public Works,
Paula Artak, local artist and Rose Thatcher, a founding member of Mission Peak
Historical Society helped in making the award decisions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Entries were judged on taste, texture and overall appearance," Niswonger
said. "Appearance is really a winning factor. Cookies displayed beautifully on
a doily-covered platter are much more inviting than cookies submitted on a
flimsy white paper plate.";   Give this year's winning recipes a try and see
if you agree with the judges.;  FIRST PLACE COOKIE RECIPE; HERSHEY'S DOUBLE;
CHOCOLATE MINT DESSERT;  Stephanie Telles, Fremont;  Your favorite brownies
recipe for 13x9x2-inch baking pan;  Mint cream layer:; 2 cups confectioners
sugar; 1/2 cup softened butter; 1/2 tsp. mint extract; 3 drops green food
coloring;  Chocolate topping layer:; 6 tablespoons butter; 1 cup Hershey's
mint chocolate chips; Make brownies according to your recipe. Cool completely
in pan. In the meantime, in a small mixing bowl, beat all of the mint cream
layer ingredients until well-blended. Spread evenly over cooled brownies and
refrigerate until well-chilled.;   In a small microwave-proof bowl, melt the
butter and the mint chips uncovered on high for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until
just melted. Stir the mixture to combine. Pour chocolate topping over mint
cream layer and chill in the refrigerator until set.;  FIRST PLACE CAKE
RECIPE; CHOCOLATE APRICOT PECAN TORTE;  Decorated with apricot roses and
chocolate leaves;  Marty Jones, Fremont;  (Note: A great do-ahead dessert); 
14-16 servings; 1/3 cup cognac; 1 1/4 cups dried apricots (about 6 ounces),
cut into 1/4-inch pieces; 1 tablespoon butter, room temperature; 3 tablespoons
dry bread crumbs; 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature; 1
cup sugar; 5 eggs, room temperature; 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, melted and
cooled; 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla; 2/3 cups dry bread crumbs; 1 1/2 cups
coarsely chopped pecans; 1 tablespoon all purpose flour;  Chocolate Icing:;
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder; 1/2 cup sugar; 1/2 cup whipping cream; 1/4
cup ( 1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces;  Apricot glaze:; 2
tablespoons cognac; 1/2 cup apricot jam; 1/2 cup pecan halves optional; For
cake: Heat cognac in a medium saucepan until just hot. Remove from heat and
mix in apricots. Soak 15 minutes. Strain apricots, reserving any soaking
liquid for glaze. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter 8 1/2-inch springform
pan with 1 tablespoon butter. Dust with the 3 tablespoons of bread crumbs.
Using electric mixer, cream butter until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in
sugar. Beat in eggs one at a time -- the mixture may look curdled. Add
chocolate and vanilla. Mix in 2/3 cup of bread crumbs. Combine pecans and
flour and blend into batter. Fold in apricots. Spoon batter into prepared pan.
Bake until tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Run
knife around edge of cake. Invert onto platter. Slide sheets of waxed paper
under edges of cake.;   For Icing: Stir all ingredients in top of double
boiler over simmering water until mixture is shiny and smooth -- about 5
minutes. Cool icing for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour icing over
cake, tilting cake to cover evenly. Using thin flat spatula, spread icing over
top and sides of cake. Refrigerate until icing is firm.;   For glaze: Add
enough cognac to soaking liquid reserved from apricots to measure 2
tablespoons. Combine with jam in heavy small saucepan. Stir over medium low
heat until melted. Strain through fine sieve into small bowl. Cool until
tepid, about 5 minutes. Pour glaze over top of cake. Using thin metal spatula,
spread evenly. Do not let glaze drip down sides of cake. Arrange pecans around
upper edge of cake, ends touching. Discard paper. Refrigerate cake until glaze
is set. (Cake can be prepared up to one day ahead.);   Arrange apricot roses
in center of torte. Place large chocolate leaf between each flower. Place
smaller leaf between each large leaf. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour
before serving.; 3 Apricot Roses; 12 moist dried apricots;  Roll each apricot
out, sticky side down between 2 sheets of waxed paper to thickness of
one-sixteenth inch. Roll one up tightly, sticky side in, to form the center of
the bud. Wrap another apricot around bud, sticky side in, pressing gently to
adhere. Repeat with 2 more apricots, overlapping half of each previous one.
Gently bend top of outer 3 apricots outward to form petals. Place toothpick
horizontally through base of rose. Cut off apricot below toothpick to form
flat base. Repeat with remaining apricots. Place roses on plate and freeze 30
minute. (Can be prepared three days ahead. Cover tightly and refrigerate.)
Discard toothpicks before arranging roses on cake.; 6 Chocolate Leaves;  3
ounces semisweet chocolate, melted;  3 large rose leaves with stems;  3 medium
rose leaves with stems; Spread chocolate over veined side of each leaf with a
small metal spatula, being careful not to drip on edges. Place on plate
chocolate side up. Freeze until just firm, about 10 minutes. Starting at the
stem end, gently peel leaf away from chocolate, freezing briefly if too soft
to work. (The chocolate leaves can be prepared 1 week ahead and refrigerated.
Wrap tightly.);  FIRST PLACE PIE; PECAN PIE;  Stephanie Telles, Fremont;  3
egg whites;  1 cup sugar; 1/4 tsp. salt; 1/2 cup chopped pecans;  20 Ritz
crackers, finely crushed; Beat egg whites until stiff. Add sugar and salt

<LEADPARA>  FOR SALMON lovers, there's nothing quite like this finny fare with a smoky
taste. Cooks, however, are often stymied by complex recipes for smoked
salmon.;   When Amelia Yee of San Jose requested a recipe for simple smoked
salmon, Dolly Greenfield of Portola Valley responded. "This recipe has been
handed down to me and is therefore tried and true," Greenfield writes. "It
freezes fantastically, too."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  READER OFFERS EASY STEPS TO SMOKE-FLAVORED SALMON  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Readers' Exchange  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  "SMOKED" SALMON; 8 teaspoons pickling salt; 2 tablespoons brown sugar; 1 1/2 
teaspoons liquid smoke; 1 tablespoon oil; 2 pounds of 2-ounce fresh salmon
fillets; Heavy-duty aluminum foil; Plastic freezer bags;  Make a paste of the
salt, brown sugar, liquid smoke and oil. Place a large piece of foil on table
and lay fish on it, skin side down. On flesh part, rub in paste mixture. Do
not rub on skin side. Wrap tightly in the foil. Place in plastic freezer bag
because it will leak out of foil during process. . It's very important to
place plastic bag in an enamel pan or another freezer bag. Leave in
refrigerator for two weeks. Then unwrap fish. Wash off paste, rewrap in foil
and leave in freezer for at least two days. It is then ready to serve. To cut,
partially defrost because if fish is too soft, it will not slice evenly.;  
Thanks also to Herman Stern of Los Gatos and Gail Shirley of San Jose for
their recipe contributions.; Sassy sauce; Sharon Runninghawk of Sunnyvale
wanted to know how to make enchilada sauce from scratch, and readers Lynne
Duell of Cupertino and Lorraine Mavraedis of Fremont responded with their
favorite recipes. The first is from HP Books' "Mexican Cookery" by Barbara
Hansen.; SALSA PARA ENCHILADAS; 8 dried California chilies; 1 1/2 tablespoons
vegetable oil; 1 garlic clove; 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour; 1 teaspoon
vinegar; 3/4 teaspoon salt; 1/4 teaspoon dried leaf oregano, crushed; 1/4
teaspoon ground cumin; 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder;  Wash chilies thoroughly.
Place in large saucepan and cover generously with water. Cover and bring to
boil. Remove from heat and let stand 45 minutes, or until softened. Drain
chilies, reserving liquid for soaking. Pull off stems. Slit chilies open and
rinse off seeds. Place chilies plus 1 cup soaking liquid in blender or food
processor and puree. Pour into a sieve and rub through sieve into bowl to
eliminate small bits of peel. Rinse blender with another 1 cup soaking liquid
and pour over remaining pulp in sieve.;   Heat oil and garlic in a medium
saucepan. When oil is fragrant with garlic, discard garlic clove. Stir in
flour until mixture is smooth. Cook about 1 minute. Add pureed chili mixture
and remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat. Cook and stir until
slightly thickened. Taste and add more salt, if needed. Makes about 2 1/3
cups. For a hotter sauce, substitute 2 or 3 dried New Mexico chilies for 2 or
3 California chilies.; (hbox); SALSA DE CHILI EN POLVO; 3 tablespoons oil; 2
tablespoons all-purpose flour; 1/4 cup mild red chili powder; 2 cups beef
broth; 2 10 1/2-ounce cans tomato puree; 1/2 teaspoon dried leaf oregano,
crushed; 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin; 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder; Salt;  Heat
oil in large saucepan. Stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Stir in chili powder.
Add beef broth, tomato puree, oregano, cumin and garlic powder. Taste and add
salt if needed. Simmer 15 minutes. Makes about 4 2/3 cups, enough for 12
enchiladas.; Key lime sources; Carolyn Schreck of San Jose writes that
Lorraine Ghoster of San Jose can find Key Lime juice at Cosentinos' on Bascom
Avenue in San Jose.; Calls for help; Lori Mascar of San Jose is looking for a
lemon bar recipe made with cake mix and topped with cream cheese, and a recipe
for a thick teriyaki sauce.;   Linda Stuckey of Saratoga has long searched for
a recipe for chocolate mousse torte. She has ruled out Sweet Things in Tiburon
and the Hyatt House Mediterranean, who would not share their recipes for a
similar torte. She does know that the recipe contains two kinds of chocolate
and chocolate wafer crumbs. She thinks the filling is not baked.;   Chris
Aycock of Sunnyvale is looking for a recipe for garlic jelly.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  IT IS possible to cater a wedding reception at home and live to tell about it.
I've done it, and so can you.;    My son married in a late-afternoon ceremony
in our home, with almost 50 guests in attendance. We have a family tradition
of celebrating everything -- including weddings -- at home, because we like
the warmth and friendliness of a familiar setting.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There's an added bonus: A home wedding costs a fraction of what a more
formal affair would cost, especially if you prepare the food yourself (except
for the cake), as I did. This is no small consideration. And if the wedding is
in your house, you have those leftovers to enjoy.;    The key to surviving and
even enjoying the event is hiring kitchen help for the day of the ceremony.
This leaves the worrying to them. Here's how to pull it off.;    (check)
First, make a list. You'll need all the things for a home wedding that you
would for any other wedding: flowers, food, cakes, drinks, photographer, the
guest book, music and help with serving the food. Interview and hire the
people you need.;    If you are fixing the food yourself, leave all but that
to friends and professionals.;    (check) Plan what you will drape the serving
tables with. Then buy wedding napkins and coordinating disposable plates,
utensils, cups and glasses for a minimum of clean-up.;    (check) Arrange for
flowers and the wedding cakes to be delivered the morning of the wedding.;   
(check) Include about six hors d'oeuvres and two types of cookies on the menu.
In choosing recipes, look for dishes that can be prepared ahead of time, even
frozen. Choose bite-size, easy-to-handle foods to reduce the possibility of
spills and stains. The food should be able to hold up for a few hours.;   
(check) Set up a timetable of when each recipe will be prepared and how it
will be stored. I started cooking a month in advance. Package each item with
instructions on thawing and final preparation. As you cook, assign serving
platters and containers (sticking a small label on the underside is a fine
idea) for each dish. Borrow extras if needed.;    The day before;  (check)
Position plates, utensils and serving pieces -- everything except the food and
flowers -- on the draped tables.;    (check)  Chill the champagne and start
defrosting the frozen dishes.;    (check) Reconfirm that flowers and cake will
be delivered the next day. You may want to reconfirm with your kitchen help,
photographer and other professionals too.;    (check) Double-check all written
instructions (assemblage of your previously prepared foods, etc.) for whoever
will be in charge of the kitchen. Leave separate lists for the kitchen help
and for the server.;    That morning;  (check) Set out platters and bowls for
the caterer, and arrange any food that can be prepared in advance.;    This is
where it ended for me. Three hours before the wedding, the kitchen staff took
over. I walked out of the kitchen, went to have my hair done, and returned as
a guest at my son's wedding. I had wonderful time.;    The following recipes
would be equally at home at any festive occasion.;      SMOKED SALMON ON BROWN
BREAD;  2 sides smoked salmon, pre-sliced;   Capers, drained;  2 lemons,
sliced;  2 loaves cocktail brown bread;  1/2 to 1 pound butter;   Set salmon
on serving platters; decorate with drained capers and thin lemon slices.
Surround salmon with thinly sliced buttered brown bread. (Recipe may be
assembled one day ahead. Arrange salmon slices on platter. Cut and butter
bread; cover with damp cloth, then cover tightly with foil; refrigerate.) Two
sides serve 50 people.;    (hbox);    TOAST CUPS WITH CURRIED ONION-CELERY
FILLING;  1 loaf white bread;  4 to 6 ounces melted butter;  1/2 cup sliced

CORN REIGNS AS KING OF MIDWEST; 
</P>
<P>
FESTIVALS: EVERY YEAR, THOUSANDS FLOCK TO THE NATIONAL SWEET CORN FESTIVAL IN 
HOOPESTON, ILLINOIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GUEBERT, Guebert writes for Midwest Living magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with baseball games and swimming holes, sweet corn is synonymous with 
summer in the Midwest. As tasseling stalks stretch straight and tall, we 
anxiously check for drying silks. Then, with mouthwatering smiles, we greet 
golden platters of corn-on-the-cob. 
</P>
<P>
Hands down, the Heartland grows more sweet corn than any other region. 
Wisconsin and Minnesota lead the way in production (more than 1.1 million tons 
annually combined). But Illinois ranks No. 1 in corn festivals. Every year, 
thousands flock to the town of Hoopeston, 100 miles south of Chicago, to feast 
on buttery ears. 
</P>
<P>
"Hot corn! Hot corn!" echoes the cry as crowds push toward mounds of 
sunshine-colored ears slathered in butter. Ready with every kind of container 
-- from cardboard boxes and backpacks to oven roasters and picnic coolers -- 
thousands of munchers gather for the National Sweet Corn Festival in this 
farming and canning community. 
</P>
<P>
During last year's celebration, corn-crazy throngs devoured or carried home 42 
1/2 tons of lip-smacking ears, cooked to perfection with the help of an 
old-fashioned steam engine. As one butter-drenched bystander punned, "It's 
complete cornage." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve thousand acres of sweet corn surround Hoopeston (population 6,400). 
That's enough to keep two shifts at the Stokely USA corn-canning plant humming 
all summer. 
</P>
<P>
The approaching end of the sweet-corn season signals the start of Hoopeston's 
festival (Aug. 30 to Sept. 3 this year). Launched in 1938, the festival 
attracted an estimated 60,000 last year. ("A conservative guess," insists Dave 
Barker, last year's festival chairman.) 
</P>
<P>
Free corn-on-the-cob highlights the last three days of the celebration. 
Naturally, there's a big corn-eating competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The winner in the adult division usually chomps more than five ears in the 
alloted three minutes," says contest organizer John Sales Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But free corn isn't the only festival attraction. McFerren Park teems with 
carnival rides, kids' games, concerts, demolition derbies, a national beauty 
pageant, a classic-car exhibit, a flea market, a fishing derby, and a talent 
and art show. 
</P>
<P>
The competition is formidable. Over at the horseshoe pits, for example, 
contestants come from 100 miles away every year. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors at the top rung of the six-class ladder throw ringers 65% to 75% of 
the time. (Pitch a ringer with at least one of every five throws and you can 
qualify for the lowest level of competition.) 
</P>
<P>
Hoopeston Jaycees, who organize the event, donate all proceeds to local 
charities. Everyone in town contributes something. 
</P>
<P>
The festival hits its stride on Saturday, when a big parade winds through town 
to McFerren Park. Parade enthusiasts line the curbs. As the procession sweeps 
past the town's two canneries and a can-making plant, Stokely employees and 
others unfortunate enough to have to work their regular jobs during the busy 
sweet-corn harvest season lean from open windows to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
The crowning glory of the festival is the National Sweetheart Pageant, spawned 
by a local Miss Sweet Corn competition. Four past National Sweethearts have 
been named Miss America, proving that Hoopeston judges know how to pick more 
than sweet corn. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two Miss America hopefuls from states as far away as Alaska and Maine 
entered the competition last year. 
</P>
<P>
During all the goings-on, the ears keep bubbling. How do you cook 42 1/2 tons 
of sweet corn? "First," says Steve Eyrich, who works for a Hoopeston firm that 
manufactures canning equipment, "you get an old-fashioned steam engine and 
replumb it." 
</P>
<P>
The massive iron monster, belching black coal smoke amid rising clouds of 
shimmering steam, circulates boiling water through a series of shiny cattle 
troughs. Jaycee volunteers dunk basketfuls of fresh sweet corn -- which an 
antique shucking machine husks -- into the steamy bath. After that, the 
volunteers dump the corn into huge pans and hand-butter the ears using giant 
brushes. 
</P>
<P>
Corn-loving throngs that gather watch each step, as if the ears were crisp $20 
bills. Finally comes the shout everyone is waiting to hear: "Hot corn! Hot 
corn!" And after that, it's everyone for himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 When summer gets steamy, team up these two abundant Midwest vegetables in a 
cool salad. 
</P>
<P>

CULINARY SOS: HONEY-GLAZED HAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: For Thanksgiving I want to make a honey-baked ham similar to the ones 
sold commercially. Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
 -- ROGER 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ROGER: Here is a recipe for a honey-glazed ham, with instructions for 
slicing the ham before heating, if you want the ham precut. 
</P>
<P>
BAKED HONEY HAM 
</P>
<P>
2 cups honey 
</P>
<P>
2 cups brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup cider vinegar 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
1 (5- to 6-pound) cooked ham, bone in, or 1 (3- to 4-pound) boneless ham 
</P>
<P>
Combine honey, brown sugar, vinegar, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. Bake bone-in 
ham at 350 degrees 1 hour to heat through, basting with honey sauce 
occasionally. Place in broiler to glaze top. 
</P>
<P>
To cook boneless ham, slice halfway through at 1/4-inch intervals, then tie 
with string. Place in roasting pan. Heat honey sauce and pour over ham to 
marinate 24 hours before baking. Then bake at 350 degrees 1 hour or until 
heated through. Glaze top under broiler, if desired. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Approximately 10 years ago, The Times ran a recipe for a cake made 
with Bourbon. Although I made it once, I did not keep the recipe. It was an 
adult cake, and I had youngsters at the time and I failed to allow for their 
growing up. With no children around an adult cake would not only be delicious, 
but unique. 
</P>
<P>
 -- RITA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR RITA: Get out the bourbon. You are going to have a very nice cake. 
</P>
<P>
BOURBON NUT CAKE 
</P>
<P>
4 cups sifted flour 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
4 teaspoons ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
1 cup butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
6 eggs 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces bourbon, about 
</P>
<P>
4 cups coarsely chopped pecans 
</P>
<P>
1 pound dark raisins 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound candied cherries, sliced or chopped 
</P>
<P>
Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
Sift together flour, baking powder and nutmeg. Cream butter well, then 
gradually add sugar and continue to cream until fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Add sifted dry ingredients alternately with bourbon. Stir in nuts, raisins and 
cherries. Turn batter into well-greased 10-inch tube pan lined on bottom with 
wax paper. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 300 degrees 2 hours, or until cake tester inserted near center comes 
out clean. If top begins to brown before cake is done, cover loosely with foil. 
Remove cake from oven and let stand 10 to 15 minutes, then turn out onto rack 
to cool completely. 
</P>
<P>
When cool, sprinkle with additional bourbon and wrap. Use more bourbon if 
fragrant cake is desired. Let cake mellow 1 week or longer for best flavor. 
Sprinkle with sifted powdered sugar before slicing. Makes about 16 servings. 
</P>

DEAR SOS: The woman who wrote to you asking for the recipe for Mexican lasagna 
will be disappointed with the one you printed. I am enclosing the recipe from 
Lawry's Consumer Kitchens so you can update your files. This recipe is a 
favorite of many. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CINDY 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CINDY: Thanks. By the way, for those who wonder what in the world to do 
with all that leftover turkey, try using cooked, cubed or chopped leftover 
turkey meat in lieu of ground beef in this recipe. Brown the turkey lightly 
before adding seasonings, tomatoes and other ingredients. Continue to cook as 
directed, even though turkey has been cooked once before. 
</P>
<P>

anise;   Grated zest of two lemons;  1 cup milk;  1 tablespoon vanilla
extract;  1/2 vanilla bean, split;   Glaze:;  1/3 cup Pernod;  1/3 cup lemon
juice;  1/2 cup sugar;   Cream butter and sugar until light. Add eggs one at a
time. Sift dry ingredients together; add vanilla extract and seeds scraped
from inside vanilla bean to milk. Add dry ingredients to butter-sugar mixture
in three parts, alternating with milk. Pour into buttered and floured bundt
pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into cake
comes out clean. Cool, turn out of pan.;    Whisk together glaze ingredients
and pour or brush over cake.;     CAPPUCCINO BRULEE; La Folie;  For brulee
mix:;  2 cups heavy cream;  3 tablespoons espresso coffee;  5 large egg yolks;
 6 tablespoons granulated sugar;  1 1/2 teaspoons coffee extract;   For
meringue mix:;  1 cup granulated sugar;  1 cup water;  4 egg whites;   One
pinch salt;   Cocoa powder;   Bring cream to a boil. Add espresso coffee. Whip
egg yolks and sugar to a ribbon. In a fine stream, beat the cream and coffee
mixture into the yolk and sugar mixture. Add coffee extract. Pour through a
fine strainer into pitcher. Place 12 ramekins in a shallow baking dish. Fill
the ramekins with brulee mix. Surround ramekins with hot water until halfway
up the side of the ramekins. Cover with foil or a cookie sheet. Bake about an
hour at 250 degrees or until brulees are firm at the edge, but still soft in
the center. Do not overbake. Chill completely.;    For meringue mix: Place
sugar with the water in a small copper pan and bring to a boil. As the sugar
cooks, beat the whites until stiff. Check the sugar. When it reaches 248
degrees or the hard-ball stage, it is ready to use (if you don't have a candy
thermometer, let a drop of sugar fall from a spoon into a glass of cold water;
the sugar should form a ball and hold its shape on the bottom of the glass).
With the mixer on medium speed, pour the boiling sugar into the egg whites,
being careful not to let it fall on the edge of the bowl or on the beaters,
add salt. Beat until cool. Transfer the meringue into a pastry bag and pipe a

WHERE THE PROOF IS; 
</P>
<P>
DICKENS NEVER TASTED ANYTHING LIKE THIS PERSIMMON PUDDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ZIMMERMAN, Linda Zimmerman is the author of Puddings, Custards and 
Flans (Clarkson Potter). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IN COOKING, as in life, looks can be deceiving. Take steamed puddings. Though 
they appear complicated, steamed puddings are deceptively easy to prepare, 
requiring only patience and a small amount of work. Ingredients are quickly 
mixed together, poured into a buttered pudding mold, then steamed. The 
delicious concoction that emerges is a moist and elegant dessert bearing little 
resemblance to that "speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm" that Charles 
Dickens lovingly described in "A Christmas Carol." 
</P>
<P>
Once steamed, the puddings can be served immediately with hard sauce or left to 
mellow for several days, sometimes even several months, depending on the 
ingredients. With time, flavors merge, which makes a tastier pudding upon 
reheating. Steamed puddings also travel well, and they make terrific gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Two types of persimmons are available from October to January--the large, 
flaming orange, acorn-shaped Hachiya and the smaller, lighter-colored, tomato- 
shaped Fuyu. Hachiyas have a tannic, acrid taste if they are eaten before the 
flesh has ripened to a soft, almost mushy consistency. The Fuyus, more delicate 
in flavor than the Hachiyas, have a firm, plum-like texture when ripe and are 
tannin-free. Both are equally delicious when used in baked goods, especially 
this steamed pudding. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying Rum Butter is also known as hard sauce. It lasts for months in 
the refrigerator and also keeps well frozen. The recipe can be doubled and 
stored in one-cup containers. 
</P>
<P>
PERSIMMON PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Prepare pot for steaming pudding (see below). 
</P>
<P>
Soak dried fruit, raisins and currants in brandy. Sift flour, cinnamon, nutmeg 
and salt into small bowl. Set aside. In electric mixer or food processor, cream 
remaining butter and sugar with egg yolks, vanilla and lemon juice. Mix in 
persimmon puree and half-and-half. Dissolve baking soda in hot water and stir 
into persimmon mixture. Stir in sifted ingredients and pecans. In separate 
bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Carefully fold into batter. Pour 
batter into mold and place lid on top. 
</P>
<P>
Steam on rack over boiling water 2 hours and 20 minutes or until skewer 
inserted into pudding comes out almost clean. Remove mold to rack and cool 10 
minutes before unmolding or until pudding shrinks away from sides of mold. 
</P>
<P>

containers. 
</P>
<P>
RUM BUTTER 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted several times 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Beat all ingredients together until light and fluffy. Serve at room temperature 
or cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Makes 2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
NOTES: Pudding molds should only be filled 2/3 to 3/4 full so pudding can rise 
and expand. Always tap the pudding on counter several times to break up any air 
bubbles before tightly securing lid. Use deep, heavy stock ot or spaghetti 
cooker that is large enough to allow steam to circulate around whole pudding 
mold. Filled mold should rest on small rack, trivet or folded cloth placed on 
bottom of pot.

<LEADPARA>  COMPANY is coming over in an hour and you have suddenly entered the panic
zone. Dessert somehow was left out of otherwise well-thought-out plans. And
now there seems to be no way to beat the clock.;    When your stomach is
turning, would-be host or hostess, what do you do?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CONVENIENCE FOODS TAKE DELICIOUS TURN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A. Commit hara-kiri because you are going to lose face.;    B. Pay the kid
next door to go to the bakery.;    C. Call your guests and confess, asking
them to pick up something sweet on their way over.;    D. None of the above.; 
  The correct answer is "D." Look into your pantry and relax. All you need is
heavy cream, milk, a package of instant vanilla pudding, apricot preserves and
the store-bought pound cake that you originally bought for tea with your
sister. Whip them all together and you will come up with gateau Claudine, a
delicious cake that tastes as good as homemade. It takes only minutes and
tastes like you spent hours.;    All you skeptics are wincing. You are not
going to serve your guests some yucky thing that was developed by Becky
Home-ecky for a high school cooking class. Your guests are too important for
second best. No convenience food in your kitchen. You are too sophisticated,
too urbane, frankly too chicken to have your friends find out how easy it was
to make dessert.;    Well, Jacques Pepin, once personal chef to three
presidents of France and gourmet cooking guru to millions of loyal fans,
doesn't feel too sophisticated or urbane. And if it's good enough for him, why
shouldn't it be good enough for you?;    But, really, instant pudding?
Escoffier must be flipping in his grave.;    Pepin says he already has been
criticized by food writers and chefs about the use of convenience foods in his
new book, "The Short-Cut Cook" (William Morrow and Co.; $19.95), but he
declares that he isn't a food snob. After many years of teaching real people
how to cook, he says he knows what they want.;    "The proof of the pudding is
in the pudding, and it's really good," he says without apology for his gateau
Claudine, named after his 23-year-old daughter because she prefers the quick
version to his elaborate multilayered cakes with homemade buttercream icing.; 
  In fact, a major premise of his new book is that Americans, who tend to
overdo everything, have become food snobs and have elevated the term
"homemade" to a religion. And homemade, he adds, is only "best" when it is
superior in taste and quality to what you can buy.;    "In France," he adds,
"people don't fight it. That's not to say that people should never make their
own bread. But if the store-bought is good quality, you should buy it rather
than try to make it yourself.";    Whether it's boneless, skinless chicken
breasts or store-bought pound cake, Pepin says the object is to make life as
easy as possible for the busy home cook for after-work meals or for a weekend
dinner party. His shortcut cooking style combines fresh foods with the best of
supermarket convenience foods.;    But don't be misled. You won't find every
kind of convenience food in the Pepin cupboard.;    "Some are good and some
are bad," he says. "Fresh is always better. But if you have a house in the
country and were out skiing all day and suddenly four guests show up, there's
nothing wrong with using frozen bread dough and frozen corn to make dinner."; 
  Time-cutting tips;  Here are some of his convenience food do's and don'ts:; 
  (check) He prefers fresh vegetables first, then frozen. He rarely uses
canned because he doesn't like the taste and texture. His pick of the frozen
veggies includes corn and peas, considering the tiny frozen peas as better
than fresh. And frozen asparagus works well in cream of asparagus soup. But
canned peas and canned asparagus rate thumbs down.;    (check) Canned chicken
and beef broth are acceptable, but read the label to make sure the brand you
buy doesn't have too much salt. Remember, ingredients are listed in order of
predominance.;    (check) Frozen bread dough can be a great time saver to make
bread, pizza or calzones, but look for those with simple ingredients, such as
bread flour, yeast and salt.;    Unlike most other fast-cooking books, his
shortcut cooking has no 30- or 60-minute deadline.;    "Basically, the focus
of the book is not to have to cook everything in five minutes," he says. "It's
more a question of making life easier. Coincidentally, many of the recipes are
very fast, but I did not want to be limited.";    The recipes that take more
time are intended to be company meals or to be prepared on weekends when we
have more time. So how does this shortcut cooking fit in when you're
entertaining?;    Market as sous chef;  First, he says, determine how much
time you have to shop and prepare the meal and then pick the menu. Then, you
must start to look at the supermarket as your personal sous-chef -- to help
with everything from chopping vegetables to preparing sauces and dips.;   
"The idea," he says, "is to take stuff from the supermarket and give it your
own signature. . . . The point is not to buy prepared food. What you do is buy
partially prepared food and finish it yourself to make it your own food with
your own taste.";    The following recipe should take only five minutes to
prepare if the shrimp are shelled.; MUSTARD-BROILED SHRIMP;  1 pound large
shrimp (26 to 30 per pound), preferably shelled;  3 tablespoons honey mustard
(see note);  2 tablespoons dark soy sauce;  1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce;   If
the shrimp are not already shelled, shell them and rinse thoroughly under cool
water; pat dry with paper towels.;    In a small bowl, combine the honey
mustard, soy sauce and Tabasco. Stir the shrimp into the sauce and coat them
well. Then remove them from the sauce (reserving what's left) and arrange in a
single layer in a gratin dish or on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.; 
  At serving time, place the shrimp under a preheated broiler, about 5 inches
from the heat. Cook about 2 minutes on one side, turn with tongs and cook on
the other side for about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the reserved sauce until
boiling, turn down to medium and keep cooking until ready to serve.;   
Arrange the shrimp on a serving platter or individual plates and top with the
sauce.;    Makes 4 servings.;    Note: You can make honey mustard by mixing
honey into whole-grain mustard to give it a sweet-hot taste.; (hbox);    The
following recipe for a warm, easy-to-make lentil and sausage stew is great for
cold-weather entertaining for a crowd. Any leftovers? Pepin says it will keep
for up to a week in the refrigerator and weeks in the freezer. The best way to
reheat the stew, he says, is in the microwave oven. Serve it with some Dijon
mustard on the side and a green salad.; LENTIL AND SAUSAGE STEW;  1 1/2 pounds
hot Italian sausage;  5 1/2 cups water;  1 pound dried lentils;  3 large
cloves garlic, peeled and chopped;  1 large onion, peeled and cut into 8
pieces;  2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces;  1 teaspoon Italian
seasoning;  1 jalapeno pepper, minced (optional);  1/2 cup dry white wine;  1
chicken bouillon cube;   Cut the sausages into 1 1/2-inch pieces and place
them in a large, deep saucepan or Dutch oven. Add 1/2 cup of the water and
bring to a boil over high heat. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, by which time
the sausages will have released some fat. Uncover the pan and continue cooking
until all the moisture has evaporated and the sausages are frying in their own
fat. Fry for about 2 minutes.;    Meanwhile, rinse the lentils under cold
water. Add them to the pan with the remaining 5 cups water and all the other
ingredients. Mix well and bring to a boil. Then cover the pan, reduce the heat
to very low and boil gently for 40 to 45 minutes, until most of the liquid has
been absorbed and the lentils are cooked.;    Makes 8 to 10 servings.;   
Note: The leftover stew also can be made into soup. Puree the stew in a food
processor, adding water or chicken stock to thin it to the consistency of a
soup. Season with salt and pepper to taste, ladle into soup bowls, sprinkle
with grated Swiss cheese and serve with crusty French bread.; (hbox);   
Although Pepin typically makes elaborate cakes with rich buttercream icings,
his daughter Claudine loves this simple cake. You can make your own cake or
use a store-bought sponge or pound cake. Decorate it as elaborately as you
want, using candied fruit or violets.; GATEAU CLAUDINE;  1 cup heavy cream;  1
package (3 1/2 ounces) instant vanilla pudding;  1 cup milk;  1 sponge or
pound cake, about 7 inches in diameter and 1 1/2 inches thick;  2 tablespoons
apricot preserves;   Whip the cream until firm and set aside.;    Mix the
instant pudding with the milk according to the directions on the pudding box
(but using half the milk called for on the box) until combined. Fold in the
whipped cream. Set the frosting aside. It should be ready to use in 10 to 15
minutes.;    Cut the cake in half horizontally and place one of the halves on
a plate. Spread the jam over it and cover the jam with a layer of the
frosting. Place the second cake layer on top and cover the top and sides with
frosting. If desired, spoon any remaining frosting into a pastry bag fitted
with a star tip and add decorative touches to the cake. Cut into wedges and
serve.;    Makes 6 servings.  </TEXT>

   Here are two Christmas cookie recipes:
   
   Lebkuchen, from ``The Christmas Cook,'' by William Woys Weaver
(Harper Perennial, $18.95)
   A traditional German Christmas cookie, large, thick and chewy.
   Yield: Approximately 7 dozen
   8} cups all-purpose flour
   2{ tablespoons baking soda
   1 tablespoon ground cloves
   1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
   1 tablespoon ground cardamom
   4 cups ground almonds
   { cup plus 2 tablespoons chopped citron
   2 cups plus 3 tablespoons honey
   2 cups plus 3 tablespoons unsulfured molasses
   4 tablespoons brandy
   
   Sift the flour, soda and spices together twice. Add the ground
almonds and citron. Mix the honey and molasses in a saucepan and
heat to a gentle boil. Remove from the stove. Make a hole in the
center of the flour, and add the honey mixture while still hot. As
you stir this into the flour, gradually add the brandy. Work this
up into a ball of dough, cover and set aside to ripen in the
refrigerator for eight days. The dough will rise in bulk as it
ripens.
   On the eighth day, roll out the dough \-inch thick and cut into
2{-inch rounds. Set these on greased baking sheets, cover and store
in a cool place overnight.
   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
   Bake the cookies 12 to 15 minutes, or until fully risen and pale
brown on the bottom. Cool on racks. As they cool, the cookies will
harden. Store in airtight containers.

and butter until fluffy. Add the egg and extracts and beat until
blended. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining dry
ingredients. On low speed, gradually add them to the butter mixture
and mix just until the dough can be gathered into a ball.
   Scrape the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and use the wrap,
not your fingers, to press the dough together to form a thick flat
disc. Wrap it well and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes,
preferably no longer than three hours.
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
   Separate the sour balls into individual colors and pulverize
them separately in a blender or food processor. Place each color in
a small container and set aside.
   Using about a quarter of the dough at a time, roll out the dough
to &lsqb;-inch thickness between two sheets of plastic wrap or on a
lightly floured counter. Cut out cookies with a three-inch cookie
cutter, spraying or greasing the cutter as needed to prevent
sticking.
   With a small, angled metal spatula or pancake turner, transfer
the cookies to cookie sheets lined with aluminum foil and greased.
If you are planning to hang the cookies, make small holes with the
blunt end of a wooden skewer.
   Cut out shapes for the stained glass in each cookie with small
cutters or with a small sharp knife. Use the tip of a small sharp
knife to fill the holes with candy pieces, filling just to the top
of the dough.
   Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly
browned and the candy has melted completely. For even baking,
rotate the cookie sheets from top to bottom and front to back
halfway through the baking period. Watch carefully toward the end
of baking to see that the candy does not start to carmelize and
turn brown.
   Allow the cookies to cool completely on the sheets. Carefully
peel off the aluminum foil.
   Store in an airtight container, between sheets of wax paper, at
room temperature. Will keep several weeks.

<TEXT>   CUSTOM FRUIT CAKE; 1 cup butter; 1 cup dark brown sugar; 1/4 cup molasses; 6
eggs; 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour; 1/2 teaspoon salt; 1 teaspoon baking
powder; Juice and rind of 1 orange; Juice and rind of 1 lemon; 1 cup pitted
dates, cut into large pieces (see note); 2 cups golden raisins; 2 cups dark
raisins; 2 cups currants; 1 cup dried cherries; 3 cups pecans, walnuts or
almonds or combination; 1 cup sweetened dried pineapple, cut up; 1/2 cup apple
juice, sherry, brandy or orange juice; 1/2 cup brandy or rum to brush on cake
as it matures;  Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Grease 8 1/2-by-3-inch round
English cake pan or pan of similar size, two 9-by-3-inch loaf pans or multiple
smaller pans; cut baking paper to fit bottom of each pan.;   Beat the butter,
brown sugar and molasses until light. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Stir
together flour, salt and baking powder. Set aside 1/2 cup of this mixture to
dust fruit.;   Beat the orange and lemon juice and rinds into the batter, then
stir in the flour mixture by hand.;   Combine fruits and nuts and toss with
the reserved flour mixture. Stir into the batter, together with the apple
juice or other liquid. Pile into prepared pan, filling three-fourths full.
Bake 1 1/2 hours for large round cake, 1 hour for loaf pans or about 50
minutes for mini pans. Reduce oven heat to 275 degrees, cover top of cake with
foil and cook for the same amount of time again.;   Allow cake to cool in pan,
then invert onto cooling rack. Brush cake generously with brandy or rum. Wrap
in foil and store in airtight tin. Brush cake every few days with more brandy
or rum. Cake will be ready to eat in 1 month, or store up to 3 months, tightly
wrapped.;   Note: If you use your own mix of fruit, use 9 cups of whole or
cut-up fruit. Choose from candied or dried cherries, dried apricots, any glace
fruits, dried figs, coconut, dates, raisins, currants.; VIOLA'S SHERRIED
WALNUTS; 1 1/2 cups sugar; 1/2 cup cream sherry; 1 teaspoon light corn syrup;
Pinch salt; 1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon rind; 2 1/2  cups walnuts;  Combine
the sugar, sherry, corn syrup, salt and lemon rind in a small saucepan. Bring
to 238 degrees on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat and add the nuts,
stirring until the mixture turns creamy. Turn out onto an oiled cookie sheet
and break up with a fork. Allow to cool, then put into small gift tins. Makes
about 4 cups of nuts.;   Note: If you want to make more, repeat the process.
Do not double. Make up to a month before giving.; BOUQUET GARNI SACHETS; 1 jar
dried parsley flakes; 1 jar peppercorns; 1 jar dried thyme; 1 jar bay leaves;
1 jar dried rosemary; 1 jar dried tarragon;  Pour the spices into a bowl and
stir well to blend thoroughly. Remove labels from the bottles; return the
spices to the bottles. Replace labels with your own labels.;   Note: Use the
standard-size jar of each spice to make this mixture. Use the same brand so
you'll have equal amounts of each spice.;   To use: Place 2 tablespoons
mixture in 6-inch square of good cheesecloth and tie up with string, or use
mulling bags. Use in soups, stews, inside a roasting chicken or in a meat
roasting pan.;   Hint: When tying the cheesecloth, leave the string long so
that it can be tied to the handle of the pot, making the bouquet easy to
retrieve.; RUMTOPF; Blemish-free fruit (Including strawberries, raspberries,
peaches, apricots, apples, pears, melons, pineapple, cherries, or grapes, in
any combination); High-quality rum or brandy; Sugar (superfine dissolves
best);  Find a large, wide-mouth stoneware crock that will hold about 20
cups.;   Remove stones and cores from fruit, as well as peels if you desire.
Cut fruit to uniform size, about the same size as the strawberries.;   Start
with 2 pounds of fresh strawberries. Sprinkle with 1 pound of sugar and let
stand overnight on the counter. Pour into the container, then just cover with
brandy or rum. Cover with plastic wrap and weight down with a saucer or other
object so the fruit is submerged.;   As you find good fruit, keep adding to
the pot, together with half the fruit's weight in sugar. Add liquor to cover
each addition.;   The rumtopf should be full by 1 month before Christmas.
Cover with plastic wrap and leave a month in a cool, dark place.;   Note: You
can either spoon out the mixture into gift jars or, if you have the jars ahead
of time, you can do the whole process in individual jars by dividing the
fruit, sugar and liquor among them.;   Serving tips: This is a marvelous sauce
for ice cream or pound cake. Or, serve with crepes.; LEBKUCHEN; 1 cup honey;
3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar; 1 egg; 1 tablespoon lemon juice; Grated peel
of 1 lemon; 2 1/3 cups flour; 1 teaspoon cinnamon; 1/2 teaspoon ground
allspice; 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves; 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg; 1/2 teaspoon
salt; 1/2 teaspoon baking soda; 1 cup sliced almonds or whole blanched
almonds; Glaze (recipe follows);  Heat honey until bubbling. Remove from heat
and cool slightly, then beat in the sugar, egg, lemon juice and peel; set
aside until lukewarm. Combine flour, seasonings and baking soda; add the honey
mixture and stir well to blend. Cover and refrigerate from 8 hours to 2 days.;
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Set them 2
inches apart on a cookie sheet lined with baking paper. Press flat with the
bottom of a wet glass. Press in 1 or 2 almond slices or 1 whole almond. Bake
for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Brush with glaze while still warm,
then allow to cool. Store in airtight containers for a few weeks. These
cookies start out hard and soften as they mature. Makes about 50 cookies.;  
Glaze: Combine 1 cup confectioners' sugar and 4 to 5 tablespoons water,
stirring to make a runny glaze.;   Note: Make cookies a month to six weeks
before giving.; MULLING SPICE; 12 cinnamon sticks; 1/4 cup whole cloves; 1
tablespoon nutmeg; 1 tablespoon cardamom; 1/4 cup allspice berries; 1/4 cup
juniper berries; Rind of 1 orange, cut into thin strips; Rind of 1 lemon, cut
into thin strips;  Mix all ingredients well, then divide into 6 mounds. Using
6-inch squares of good cheesecloth or 6 mulling bags, fill with the spices.
Tie the cloth or bags with string. (Leave string long so packet can be
retrieved easily.);   To use: Drop 1 bag into 1 quart cider or wine and heat.
(Do not bring to boil.) If using wine, try a hearty burgundy or an Italian
rose.;   Variation: For sweet mulling spice, add 1 cup dark brown sugar.  </TEXT>

   Here are two Christmas cookie recipes:
   
   Lebkuchen, from ``The Christmas Cook,'' by William Woys Weaver
(Harper Perennial, $18.95)
   A traditional German Christmas cookie, large, thick and chewy.
   Yield: Approximately 7 dozen
   8} cups all-purpose flour
   2{ tablespoons baking soda
   1 tablespoon ground cloves
   1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
   1 tablespoon ground cardamom
   4 cups ground almonds
   { cup plus 2 tablespoons chopped citron
   2 cups plus 3 tablespoons honey
   2 cups plus 3 tablespoons unsulfured molasses
   4 tablespoons brandy
   
   Sift the flour, soda and spices together twice. Add the ground
almonds and citron. Mix the honey and molasses in a saucepan and
heat to a gentle boil. Remove from the stove. Make a hole in the
center of the flour, and add the honey mixture while still hot. As
you stir this into the flour, gradually add the brandy. Work this
up into a ball of dough, cover and set aside to ripen in the
refrigerator for eight days. The dough will rise in bulk as it
ripens.
   On the eighth day, roll out the dough \-inch thick and cut into
2{-inch rounds. Set these on greased baking sheets, cover and store
in a cool place overnight.
   Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
   Bake the cookies 12 to 15 minutes, or until fully risen and pale
brown on the bottom. Cool on racks. As they cool, the cookies will
harden. Store in airtight containers.

NOW  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Kyra Effren is a Dallas free-lance writer. The last two ideas are from "Betty
Crocker's Christmas Book."  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The disadvantage of making gifts is that you usually remember to start
every Hanukkah or during the busy Christmas season. You end up trying to pull
something together in the middle of the night, or give up and promise you'll
do it next year.;   Well, this is next year, and here is a chance to get a
head start.;   Remember that packaging is important. Look for pretty bottles,
tins, plates and jars to dress up your gift. Scour second-hand shops and
stores that specialize in storage.;   Wrap the container in tissue, cellophane
or ribbon, or arrange several items in a basket. Add a label with a
description of the item, a use-by date and storage instruction. Recipes and
ideas on how to use the gift also are appreciated.;   Easy gift ideas;   (box)
 Herbs de Provence Spice Mix: Combine 3 tablespoons dried marjoram, 3
tablespoons dried thyme, 3 tablespoons dried savory, 1 tablespoon dried basil,
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon dried sage and 1/2 teaspoon fennel
seeds. Mix well and spoon into small jars. Makes 3/4 cup. Use to season
chicken, vegetables or meat.;   (box)  Herb Vinegar: Place 2 or 3 sprigs fresh
herb of choice in each bottle. Fill with red or white wine vinegar. Close
tightly and store in a cool, dark place. Vinegar will be ready in 2 months.
Use in dressings or where herbs and vinegar are called for in a recipe.;  
Suggested combinations for herb vinegars: basil with red wine vinegar;
tarragon or parsley with white wine vinegar; basil and oregano in red wine
vinegar for Italian vinegar; rosemary in either kind; star anise in rice
vinegar for Oriental vinegar.;   (box)  Homemade Vinegar: Pour 1/4 cup
commercial red wine vinegar into a wine bottle. Add leftover red wine
(unsweetened, unfortified), adding more as you have leftover red wine. When
the bottle is full, cover with cheesecloth and tie with rubber band. Store for
1 month or more at room temperature. When mature, carefully pour into gift
bottles. If sediment forms, strain through a cheesecloth-lined funnel.;  
(box)  Honey Mustard: Stir together 1 cup honey, 1/2 cup Dijon-style mustard
and 6 tablespoons red wine vinegar. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Fill
gift jars and label. Refrigerate. Makes 4 ( 1/2 cup) jars. Makes a good
sandwich spread or an accompaniment to meats and chicken.;   (box)  Gourmet
Olives: Combine 2 jars (about 7 ounces each) drained large green olives and 2
cans (about 7 ounces each) ripe olives in a large jar. Mix together 3/4 cup
vegetable oil with 3 tablespoons vinegar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 3 cloves
of finely chopped garlic and 10 crushed peppercorns. Pour over olives and
refrigerate 10-12 hours. Shake olives occasionally to coat evenly. Divide into
jars. Makes about 3 cups.;   (box) Cranberry Cordials: Mix 2 (12-ounce)
packages chopped frozen cranberries with 4 cups sugar and 3 cups vodka in a
2-quart jar or crock. Cover tightly. Let stand at room temperature 2 weeks,
stirring or inverting jar every day. Strain, pour into cordial bottles and
seal. Makes 5 cups.  </TEXT>

</P>
<P>
DEAR MS. L.M.F.: It's not difficult to create Veal Oscar, basically a layered 
dish of veal cutlet, crab meat, asparagus spears and Sauce Bearnaise. It was a 
favorite on a lot of menus when Continental restaurants were big from the 1930s 
through the '60s. 
</P>
<P>

with salt and pepper. Add wine, cover and simmer 20 minutes or until tender. 
</P>
<P>
Saute crab meat in remaining 2 tablespoons butter in small skillet, 3 to 4 
minutes. Arrange veal cutlets on serving dishes. Place equal portions crab meat 
over cutlets. 
</P>
<P>
Pour veal cooking liquid into crab skillet and boil rapidly until reduced to 
1/4 cup. Spoon over crab meat. Add 3 asparagus spears to each serving. Drizzle 
with Sauce Bearnaise and serve remaining sauce on side. Makes 4 servings.

evaporated.
