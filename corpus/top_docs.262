   The last princess of the royal dynasty
of Korea was buried Monday with musicians blowing conch shells and
honor guards in traditional red, blue and gold robes escorting the
coffin to the royal tombs.
   Prince Yi Pang-ja, a member of Japan's royal family who married
a Korean prince, died April 30 at age 88, nine days after the death
of Princess Tok-hye, her sister-in-law. The princesses were the
last two royal members of the Yi dynasty that ruled Korea for five
centuries until 1910.
   Hundreds of official mourners dressed in traditional white robes
and tall hats made of hemp followed the princess' only son in a
royal funeral procession from her home at Changdok Palace through
crowded downtown streets.
   Other marchers wore the red, blue and gold tunics of palace
guards and court officials of the Yi Dynasty. Musicians played a
funeral dirge on long trumpets, bells and conch shells as several
thousand people stood on curbs to watch the procession pass.
   ``Your majesty, your majesty,'' wailed a woman in the crowd who
said she worked at the palace.
   Officials said the ceremony would be Korea's last royal funeral
since none of the royal family's surviving descendants has a royal
title.
   Princess Pang-ja, whose Japanese name was Masako, was a cousin
of Japanese Empress Dowager Nagako, widow of Emperor Hirohito. She
married Prince Yi Un, a son of Korea's King Kojong, in Tokyo in
1920, 10 years after Japan annexed the Korean peninsula as its
colony. King Kojong was the last royal ruler of Korea.
   ``This is the passing of an era,'' said Peter Bartholomew, a
friend of the princess. ``There will never been another royal
funeral. A tradition and an era in history has died.''
   South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon said the princess
had bridged two cultures to ``become the loving grandmother of our
country. We'll never forget her.''
   Japan's Prince Mikasa, youngest brother of Hirohito, and his
wife, Princess Mikasa, attended the services as the representatives
of the Japanese Imperial household and followed the procession in a
motorcade.
   At the services in the palace grounds, Prince Mikasa bowed
toward the traditional white funeral altar, burned incense for a
happy afterlife, then bowed again to the princess' son, Yi Ku, who
was raised in Japan and lives there.
   The princess was buried, as she wished, beside her husband and
an infant son on a hillside in the royal burial grounds east of
Seoul, surrounded by the rice paddies and trees of her adopted land.
   ``I have two fatherlands: Korea and Japan. Japan has given me
body, while Korea has given me spirit,'' the princess once wrote, a
passage repeated at her funeral.
   She and her invalid husband came to Korea in 1963, and he died
in 1970. Princess Pang-ja devoted herself to philanthropic works,
founding a vocational training center for the handicapped and a
rehabilitation center for the mentally and physically disabled.

   Princess Tokhye, one of the last
survivors of the ancient Yi Dynasty that ruled Korea for five
centuries, was buried today amid prayers for the woman one mourner
called ``the unhappy princess.''
   Official mourners dressed in traditional white hemp clothes and
tall hats carried the lacquered black coffin to the grave site on a
hillside in the royal burial grounds east of Seoul.
   The princess died Friday at age 77.
   ``She was the most beautiful and most noble of princesses,''
said Alice Kim, who attended the funeral. ``And she was the most
sad.''
   The grave site was chosen by a traditional pungsu, or fortune
teller, who decides the most auspicious location and timing of a
burial. He used a compass to align the casket in keeping with a
Korean belief that a corpses' feet must point south to ensure a
happy afterlife.
   Lee Hae-suk, a member of the Yi Dynasty Association who helped
arrange the ceremonies, said Princess Tokhye probably wouldn't mind
if her feet didn't quite point due south because her life had been
difficult.
   ``She was a very unhappy princess,'' said Lee. ``She would be
used to being a little off.''
   About 75 people, many of them spectators, attended a traditional
Confucian burial ceremony at Changdok Palace in central Seoul,
where the princess spent the last years of her life as a recluse.
The body was then taken to the royal burial grounds.
   Princess Tokhye, a daughter of King Kojong, the last Yi king,
was born to a royal concubine named Yang in 1912, two years after
her father was forced to abdicate by the Japanese, who took control
of Korea.
   At age 13, she was sent to school in Japan and later married a
Japanese nobleman much older than herself. Her mother died before
she could return to Korea and her only child committed suicide.
   In 1951, the princess was divorced from her Japanese husband and
in 1962 she returned to her homeland, suffering from diabetes and
aphasia.
   Visitors said she was sometimes heard humming or singing to
herself, but she hadn't spoken for many years.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The building of the 
tomb of Tangun is progressing at fast speed in Korea. 
  Tangun is the father of the Korean nation who was the first 
king of Kojoson (ancient Korea) (3,000 B.C.-108 B.C.). Situated 
in Kangdong County, Yongyang municipality, the 22 meter high 
tomb will occupy an area of over 800,000 square metres when 
reconstructed. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song personally studied 
the 
legend of Tangun and materials about his tomb and saw to it that 
the tomb was excavated. After the remains of Tangun and relics 
were excavated and identified scientifically, President Kim 
Il-song went out to the spot and gave instructions to rebuild 
the tomb splendidly to be handed down to the generations to come. 
  Thus, Tangun who had long been known to be a mythical man 
was 
proved to have been a real man and the history of Kojoson 
distorted by the Japanese imperialists when they occupied Korea 
was established correctly. 
  Under the wise guidance of President Kim Il-song, cultural 
heritages which had been severely destroyed by the U.S. and 
Japanese imperialist aggressors have been reconstructed to be 
preserved as treasures of the country and the nation. 
  In recent years, the tomb of King Tongmyong, the founder of 
the Koguryo Dynasty (277 B.C.-668 A.D.) which was the strongest 
country in the East, the tomb of King Wang Kon, the first king 
of Koryo (918-1392) which was the first unified state in Korea, 
the tomb of King Kogukwon (a king of Koguryo in the middle of 
the 4th century), the tomb of King Kongmin (the 31st king of 
Koryo) and tombs of other kings have been restored to their 
original state. 
  The Kwangbop temple in Mt. Taesong (392), the Pohyon temple 
in Mt. Myohyang (1042) and the Pyohun temple in Mt. Kumgano 
(670), Buddhist temples showing the equisite architecture of the 
Korean nation, and the wall on Mt. Taesong belonging to the 
Koguryo Dynasty and the wall on Mt. Ongbang belonging to the 
Koryo Dynasty and many other architectural heritages have been 
splendidly rehabilitated. 
  The Songgyungwan Academy of Koryo (992), one of the first 
universities in the world, was recently rebuilt on an expansion 
basis to be turned into a university training light industrial 
technicians. 
  The chronicles of the Yi Dynasty of 900 books in 1,763 
volumes, the world largest governmental diary covering over 500 
years of the feudal state of the Yi Dynasty, not omitting a 
single day, has been published in modern Korean language. 
  The bibliographical book (25 volumes) of the "80,000 Blocks 
of Complete Collection of Buddhist Scriptures" of 6,793 volumes, 
a library of Buddhism belonging to the Koryo Dynasty, and the 
selected translation of major sutras of the collection have been 
published and a modern house for preserving the collection was 
built in the scenic Mt. Myohyang. 
  Many classical books of history, culture, medical sceince 
and 
other fields such as "Tonguibogam", an encyclopedic book of 
Koryo medicine, "The History of the Three Dynasties" "History of 
the Koryo Dynasty", and "The Tale of Chun Hyang" have been 
collected and arranged. 
  The Korean Central History Museum, the Korean Folklore 
Museum 
and Provincial History Museum are crowded with youth and 
children and working people everyday.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Collecting: Rarities in blue and white - Susan Moore samples
the numerous wares of quality Chinese porcelain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese porcelain takes pride of place at the seasonal Oriental art shows in
London this month. Even the British Museum presents highlights from the
Meiyintang Collection, the first public display of one of the largest and
finest private holdings of Chinese ceramics in the west.
Amassed during the last 40 years, this continental collection is remarkable
for the variety, quality and rarity of its pieces which range from Neolithic
pottery and Han and Tang dynasty tomb figures and burial wares to Ming and
Qing Imperial porcelains (June 9-September 9).
Eskenazi has a no less sumptuous feast of market rarities in its exhibition
of early blue and white (10 Clifford Street, W1, June 7-July 8). From their
first large-scale manufacture in the 14th century, these luxurious white
porcelains painted in underglaze cobalt blue have been highly prized in
China and beyond. Perhaps no ceramic tradition has been more widely imitated
or more enduringly popular.
The Middle East appears to have been the destination of a number of these
vessels. Forms are distinctly un-Chinese: there are Islamic emblems, even a
Persian inscription proclaiming a piece the property of one Alamgir Shah.
The star turn, discovered in Damascus 30 years ago, is a spectacular and
densely decorated mid-14th century Yuan dynasty dish, 46cm wide. In the
central medallion, reserved in white on a rich blue ground, are cranes and
ducks in a lotus pond, well observed and full of life.
Their liveliness is matched by the dish's surface: one of the delights of
handling blue and white is the way in which the impurities in the cobalt
produce a heaped and piled effect in the glaze and a varying intensity of
blue.
This unique piece is of museum quality and into a museum it may well go  -
given that it was broken and repaired and even hair-line cracks are not
tolerated by the new breed of avid Hong Kong collectors.
The show's other tour de force is not technically blue and white at all.
This large, deep Ming dynasty bowl of the Hongwu period (1368-98) is
decorated with scrolling peonies in underglaze copper red, which firing has
turned into the subtlest of pinks and greys. Dated 1340-1435, the 26 pieces
bear Pounds 45,000-Pounds 400,000 price tags.
At S. Marchant &amp; Son (120 Kensington Church Street, W8), the focus is on the
great age of blanc de Chine - 1640-1710 - a much more particular taste. As
this show demonstrates, however, the craftsmen of provincial Dehua gave
their glossy white wares an astonishing variety of expression. At one
extreme stands a graceful and superbly modelled Guanyin or goddess of mercy
in flowing robes. Dating around 1640, and 38cm high, the figure bears the
seal mark of the mysterious He Chaozong, the most illustrious name in Dehua
porcelain. At the other, a whistle in the form of a European gentleman in a
tricorn hat seated astride a comically grinning tiger. The whole group is
only 4.7cm high. Prices Pounds 200-Pounds 30,000 (June 3-24).
Early celadon porcelains from Korea, China and Japan are the delicate fare
at Jehanne de Biolley Oriental Art (29 Conduit Street, W1, June 1-July 1).
Prices Pounds 150-Pounds 20,000. Chinese, Korean and Japanese works of art
are also at Spink's, 5-7 King Street, SW1, June 1-17. Notable here is a pair
of white jade lotus-shaped drinking cups that unusually bear the mark of the
Qianlong emperor, and an understated white porcelain moon flask from late
Choson dynasty Korea. Prices Pounds 5,000-Pounds 150,000.
The Oriental Art Gallery's wide- ranging exhibition includes Ming and Qing
caladons, blanc de Chine and monochrome porcelains at 4 Davies Street, W1,
June 7-24. Prices Pounds 950-Pounds 55,000, with most objects under Pounds
10,000.
With characteristic theatrical flourish, Christian Deydier of Oriental
Bronzes Ltd unveils one extraordinary item for one evening only. This is a
pair of stylised gold tigers dated to 8th century BC China, their slender,
elongated bodies decorated with cinnabar stripes and formed out of gold
strips wrapped and pinned around a wooden core. Professor Han Wei, an
authority on ancient Chinese gold, has suggested that the 45cm long tiger
mounts flanked a burial pillow. Nothing quite like them is known in gold -
nor any other gold artefact of comparable size and date. Deydier is asking
around Pounds 1.5m. 96 Mount Street, W1. June 7, 5.30-8pm.

The Gallery: When Ash and Water Make Bronze and Jade

   In the seventh century, China awed the world with its exports of a fine, translucent white porcelain -- the same stuff, in fact, that we now call china. 

   But the roots of that achievement stretch back to the 15th century B.C., when potters discovered that a coating of ash and water produced an impermeable bronze-and-jade-tinted glaze after firing at high temperatures. 

   Thus celadon porcelain -- named after a character in a 17th-century French play ("L'Astree" by Honore d'Urfe) whose costume was grayish-green -- became the world's first hard-glazed ware. 
Reaching its peak in quality and quantity in the Song dynasty (10th-13th centuries), it didn't fade in popularity until the advent of blue-and-white porcelain in the 14th century. 
It is still made in China today. 

   Fortunately, you don't have to cross the Pacific to get a good look at what a ninth-century poet likened to "cracked ice and green clouds." 
The Indianapolis Museum of Art has mounted the most complete survey of celadon's 3,000-year history to date, "Ice and Green Clouds: Traditions of Chinese Celadon," at the Asia Society through Sept. 6. 
It then stops at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas (Oct. 17,1987-Jan. 3, 1988), and the Art Institute of Chicago (Feb. 4-March 27). 

   The exhibit's 87 works from collections around the world were painstakingly tracked down over a five-year period by Yutaka Mino, former curator of Oriental art at the Indianapolis Museum and now curator of Chinese and Japanese art at the Art Institute of Chicago. 
The 75 works that made the trip to New York are attractively, understatedly displayed in one room, in chronological order. 

   Celadon was rare in the beginning; it accounts for less than 1% of all ceramic discoveries from the Shang dynasty (17th-11th centuries B.C.). 
These early vessels were shaped like bronze ware and often decorated with a basketwork or clothlike pattern. 
They had a thin brown or yellow glaze. (The color of the glaze is determined by the amount of iron in the coating and the clay, and by firing techniques.) 
They were used by the ruling classes for ceremonial and funerary purposes. 
One simple widemouthed jar on display exemplifies the earliest known type of celadon, and is the only such vessel now outside China. 

   It wasn't until the Six Dynasties Period (third-sixth centuries), that celadon as we know it today was born. 
Then potters stopped imitating bronze ware and began to create wholly new forms and add whimsical touches. 
Vessels took the shape of frogs and lions, sprouted chicken and tiger heads, and were dotted with tiny molded masks representing mythological or religious figures. 
A pair of incised little fish frolic at the bottom of one large basin on display, and a small stand, perhaps for a candle, doubles as a curly maned lion ready to pounce, teeth bared. 

   The celadon of the Tang dynasty (seventh-10th centuries) -- from spittoons to ewers and little covered boxes -- took its inspiration from the silverwork of the period. 
Shapes became more refined and compact, while decoration (such as textile patterns and mythological motifs from Central Asia) began to reflect the foreign influences in China brought about by trade. 
A simple spittoon provides quite a contrast to the ornate pale-green-glazed ewer pictured here. 
It has a seated lion for a spout and is covered with bold relief leaves and flowers. 

   Some features of Tang dynasty ware survived into the Song dynasty, but for the first time celadon reflected "pure Chinese taste," Mr. Mino says, "with no outside influences." 
The most beautiful celadon ever created dates from this period, from the kilns of Longquan, south of Shanghai. 

   This silky smooth, beautifully shaped celadon, in luminescent shades from seafoam green to robin's-egg blue, is displayed here in three adjoining cases that catch the eye as soon as you enter the room. 
A long, thin dragon winds around the shoulder of one wonderful urn, in pursuit of a shiny pearl, while a rectangular vase (in a case of its own at the beginning of the exhibit) is fashioned after an ancient ritual jade vessel. 

   The Yuan dynasty (13th-14th centuries) is the last period covered by the exhibit, just before celadon went out of fashion. 
Some of these pieces have molded panels that were left unglazed and burned reddish-brown, in nice contrast to the cool greens of the glazes. 
Other vessels are punctuated by dark brown spots created by applying dots of iron oxide before glazing. 

   Celadon of all periods vividly reminds us of the artist behind the work. 
"There is no brush between the artist and the clay," Mr. Mino says, "so we really understand what he was thinking." 
"Unfortunately," he adds, "we don't know who any of these people were, because they didn't sign their names."

<TEXT>
   This quiet, bone-dry ravine
of death, overshadowed since antiquity by the Valley of the Kings
just over the hills, slowly is shedding its mystery.
   And with the mystery, its name.
   Ancients called the valley Ta-Set Neferu, the Place of Beauty.
To the Arabs it was Gates of the Ladies. Egyptologists and
guidebooks perpetuate the homage to entombed royal women: the
Valley of the Queens.
   ``It's wrong. This valley has been misunderstood and misnamed by
all Egyptologists,'' said Christian LeBlanc, field director for a
continuing 17-year French-Egyptian project to record and study its
history.
   ``We should be calling it the Valley of the Royal Children. They
were here first, but the valley became tied only to the queens and
named by tradition rather than history.''
   Season after archaeological season, LeBlanc's team has scoured
the sloping, dusty hillsides dotted with cave-like tombs to find
the origins of a sequence of burials that would last almost 2,000
years. Tombs were used repeatedly, as late as the Christian era
when pharaonic designs sometimes were plastered over and crosses
painted on.
   LeBlanc said the first burials were princes and princesses of
ancient Egypt's 18th dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a
period of decline, pharaohs and their kin once again lived and died
like kings.
   That dynasty ended in 1307 B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the
19th dynasty, changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here.
   LeBlanc said it's unclear why he did or why the practice
continued. In addition to queens, royal children still were buried
here, and concubines who cared for them and pharaohs' mothers.
   Paintings in some of the tombs show Hathor, the goddess of women
and love, emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. LeBlanc
said perhaps this indicates that religion brought the ancients
here, because Hathor's realm also included the cemeteries on what
is called the West Bank across the Nile from present-day Luxor.
   The 18th dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began,
was a time when queens traditionally shared their pharaoh's tombs
in the Valley of the Kings. Many of ancient Egypt's greatest rulers
were buried there, along with the young pharoah Tutankhamun, whose
treasure-filled tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.
   That discovery brought international fame to the Valley of the
Kings. Hundreds of other royals and officials also were buried on
the West Bank. But to the world, the glory of the pharaohs meant
the Valley of the Kings _ not the Valley of the Queens, the Valley
of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the Nobles.
   For tourist agencies, the Valley of the Queens became an
afterthought, a place to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit
to the Valley of the Kings.
   When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found
in the limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known.
   ``We couldn't understand the cemetery before, because we were
working tomb-by-tomb,'' LeBlanc said. ``Today, we've uncovered all
the major tombs and have returned the valley to the way it would
have looked when burials began.
   ``For the first time, we can write its history.''
   As LeBlanc talked, he and Fathy Hassanein, director of the
Egyptian Antiquities Organization's National Documentation Center,
walked through scores of excavators digging toward the valley's
bedrock. The job at hand was almost done, another tomb uncovered
from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for most of its
existence.
   An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that
more can be opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now.
   The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers
of Ramses II's powerful queen Nefertari, is among those so
deteriorated that they remain off-limits. More than half its
paintings of the elaborately dressed and coiffured queen have been
destroyed by natural forces.
   LeBlanc said one source for the valley's history has been
tidbits left by workers who built and decorated the tombs. For
generations they lived in a village inside the valley. Their
records, on papyrus, provided the team not only with answers but
with mysteries.
   Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen Isis
Nefret, one of Ramses II's many wives, and a queen named
Duat-Iny-Pet.
   LeBlanc said they might have been same person, but ``where are
they?''
   He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of
the queens' mummies.
   ``This is strange,'' he said. ``Did those who came afterwards
destroy them?'' He added that it could mean another royal cache
exists, perhaps mummies of queens and children.
   Typical of the tales LeBlanc has faced in rewriting a new
history for the valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the
tomb of 9-year-old prince Amon-Hir-Khopshef, son of Ramses III.
   Local guides tell fascinated visitors that Ramses' queen became
so distraught over the death of their son that she miscarried and
the mummies of both Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed.
   The story is nonsense, Leblanc said.
   Early this century, the Italian excavator Ernesto Schiaparelli
found the fetus in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the Queens.
It was Schiaparelli, not ancient priests, who placed it inside the
prince's empty sarcophagus.
   Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction
that it has its own tiny case.

18th Dynasty, a 243-year renaissance when, after a period of decline, Pharaohs 
and their kin once again lived and died like kings. 
</P>
<P>
That dynasty ended in 1307 B.C., and Ramses I, founder of the 19th Dynasty, 
changed tradition by burying his queen Sat-Re here. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said it is unclear why he did or why the practice continued. In 
addition to queens, royal children still were buried here, and concubines who 
cared for them and Pharaohs' mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Paintings in some of the tombs show Hathor, the goddess of women and love, 
emerging from a grotto that dominates the valley. LeBlanc said perhaps this 
indicates that religion brought the ancients here, because Hathor's realm also 
included the cemeteries on what is called the West Bank across the Nile from 
present-day Luxor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treasure-Filled Tombs 
</P>
<P>
The 18th Dynasty, when the graveyard for royal children began, was a time when 
queens traditionally shared their Pharaoh's tombs in the Valley of the Kings. 
Many of ancient Egypt's greatest rulers were buried there, along with the young 
Pharaoh Tutankhamun, whose treasure-filled tomb was discovered by Howard Carter 
in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
That discovery brought international fame to the Valley of the Kings. Hundreds 
of other royals and officials also were buried on the West Bank. But to the 
world, the glory of the Pharaohs meant the Valley of the Kings -- not the 
Valley of the Queens, the Valley of the Monkeys or the Tombs of the Nobles. 
</P>
<P>
For tourist agencies, the Valley of the Queens became an afterthought, a place 
to fill a half-hour after an exhausting visit to the Valley of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
When the joint expedition began, 78 burial places had been found in the 
limestone hillsides enclosing the valley. Today 98 are known. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't understand the cemetery before, because we were working 
tomb-by-tomb," LeBlanc said. "Today, we've uncovered all the major tombs and 
have returned the valley to the way it would have looked when burials began. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we can write its history." 
</P>
<P>
As LeBlanc talked, he and Fathy Hassanein, director of the Egyptian Antiquities 
Organization's National Documentation Center, walked through scores of 
excavators digging toward the valley's bedrock. The job at hand was almost 
done, another tomb uncovered from rubble that has obscured the cemetery for 
most of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restoration Work 
</P>
<P>
An aim of the project is to restore tombs in the valley so that more can be 
opened to tourists. Fewer than six are now. 
</P>
<P>
The valley's most beautiful tomb, the fabulous burial chambers of Ramses II's 
powerful queen Nefertari, is among those so deteriorated that they remain 
off-limits. More than half its paintings of the elaborately dressed and 
coiffured queen have been destroyed by natural forces. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said one source for the valley's history has been tidbits left by 
workers who built and decorated the tombs. For generations they lived in a 
village inside the valley. Their records, on papyrus, provided the team not 
only with answers but with mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Workers recorded the construction of tombs for Queen Isis Nefret, one of Ramses 
II's many wives, and a queen named Duat-Iny-Pet. 
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said they might have been same person, but "where are they?" 
</P>
<P>
He also is intrigued by a lack of burial objects or pieces of the queens' 
mummies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is strange," he said. "Did those who came afterwards destroy them?" He 
added that it could mean another royal cache exists, perhaps mummies of queens 
and children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mummified Fetus 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the tales LeBlanc has faced in rewriting a new history for the 
valley is the story of a mummified fetus inside the tomb of 9-year-old prince 
Amon-Hir-Khopshef, son of Ramses III. 
</P>
<P>
Local guides tell fascinated visitors that Ramses' queen became so distraught 
over the death of their son that she miscarried and the mummies of both 
Amon-Hir-Khopshef and the fetus were entombed. 
</P>
<P>
The story is nonsense, LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
Early this century, the Italian excavator Ernesto Schiaparelli found the fetus 
in a rubbish pile outside the Valley of the Queens. It was Schiaparelli, not 
ancient priests, who placed it inside the prince's empty sarcophagus. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the mummified fetus is so popular a tourist attraction that it has its 
own tiny case.

<DATELINE> Seattle  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the most spectacular collections of Chinese art ever to be seen in this country is currently tucked behind an amusement park at the Seattle Center. 
But the bumper-cars, carousel and cotton-candy vendors form an appropriate backdrop for "Son of Heaven," a show that seems a cross between a museum exhibit and a three-ring circus. 

   The vast selection of ancient bronzes, porcelains, paintings, sculptures and jewelry spans more than 2,500 years of Chinese history and includes many objects from recently excavated tombs. 
Culled from more than 20 Chinese museums and institutes, 92% of the artifacts have never been seen before in this country and 80% have never traveled outside of China. 

   Despite this and the high quality of the objects, all the museums approached by the private sponsors, Son of Heaven Inc., refused to take the show. 
"There are extraordinary things, wonderful things on show," said Freda Murck, associate curator of Asian art at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
But her museum, like several others, found the costs and logistical difficulties overwhelming. 
With insurance, shipping and underwriting costs, "Son of Heaven" carries a price tag of $5.5 million. 
Heavy temple and mortuary sculpture, eventually omitted, posed nightmarish problems of installation and maintenance. 
U.S. museums were, further, put off by the organizers' commercial approach and lack of professionalism. 
Ms. Murck adds that the Met didn't even try to find corporate sponsors, because the show didn't have "a dazzling list that we were ready to die for." 
Seattle added its own, highly publicized complications, notably the recent firing of the show's director, Harvey West. 
Some people here have taken to calling the show "Son of Hell." 

   The exhibit certainly has a bizarre history. 
The Chinese government initially suggested the loan to Norm Swanson, a Spokane-based travel agent who runs organized tours in China. 
Mr. Swanson tried to market the exhibit as a commercial venture in partnership with Harvey West, an art administrator known for his impresario-like projects, but they failed to win sufficient backing. 
The project later resurfaced under Mr. West's directorship in a new, nonprofit guise and was bankrolled through a combination of corporate underwriting and donations. 

   Larry Childs, president of the resulting Son of Heaven company, is a former business executive without museum experience. 
Mr. Childs, who has described himself as being in the "blockbuster business," is trying to maximize the show's popular appeal. 

   "We want the people that might go to a football game," he said. 
"The people who would go see the Seahawks play are the people I'd like to see come to this exhibit." 

   But despite the TV advertisements, 40-foot banners, and an opening gala featuring acrobats, firecrackers and every local celebrity from Seattle's Miss Chinatown to Richard Nixon's brother Edward, "Son of Heaven" has failed to take the world or even this town by storm. 
The show has been drawing crowds well under the maximum capacity of 700 people an hour. 
This may be due in part to the stiff entrance fee: $7.50 for adults. 
Beyond this, the show hasn't managed to capture the public imagination. 
The organizers themselves seem to lack a clear notion of what they are promoting. 

   "We wanted to be a show that would teach people about China and the role of the imperial institution," said Robert Thorp, the American curator of the exhibit and an associate professor of art history at Washington University at St. Louis. 

   But at four times the size of the epic "Tutankhamen" exhibit of 1978, which it rivals as pure spectacle, "Son of Heaven's" bulk may be working against its own mystique. 

   "One of the problems is that it spans over 2,500 years and goes all over China," said Ms. Murck. 
"It's very ambitious -- and for the man on the street, not easy to grasp." 

   On a recent morning, a cluster of under 100 people with tickets to the exhibit waited patiently under a long green and yellow canopy outside the entrance of the center's Flag Pavilion. 
A host of exhibit attendants dressed in brown mandarin-style jackets, clearly prepared for much larger crowds, monitored the entrance with walkie-talkies. 

   Once inside, the group was ushered into one of two auditoriums for a 10-minute sound-and-light show. 
The gongs, bells and flashing pictures of temples and thrones are meant to prepare the spectator for the Altar, the first of five thematically arranged exhibit rooms. 
A glowing jade ritual disc the size of a Frisbee hangs at the dark entrance, the first stop on a dizzying game of hopscotch that leaps back and forth over 26 centuries, six imperial dynasties, and every kind of artistic medium. 

   In a somber atmosphere silent except for the whisper of rented audio headsets, viewers moved from the Altar's Sixth century B.C. bronzes to the Outer Court's 18th-century Qing brocades and inkstands, and then on to the Temple and Eighth-century Tang sculptures. 
By the time they reached the Inner Court many were beginning to look bleary-eyed as they wandered through a sea of glass cases filled with everything from Han jugs to Ming wall-scrolls and jades. 
In the Tomb, the final room of the show, most managed a few minutes in front of the four terra-cotta warriors from the famous tomb at Xian before staggering, with expressions of relief, into the exhibit's mammoth gift shop. 

   "It's a heavy dose," Mr. Thorp admitted. 
"There is a fatigue factor that sets in, probably at the Inner Court. 
I'd love it if we could put in benches so people could rest." 

   The non-chronological organization of the exhibit adds significantly to the fatigue. 
Objects from different centuries are placed side by side, creating an atmosphere of visual and historical confusion that the thematic groupings do little to clarify. 
Many recently excavated tombs are well represented here, but the organizers' decision to scatter objects from individual tombs throughout the five rooms detracts from their impact and squanders their romance. 

   But whatever reservations one may have about the exhibit, there are wonderful things to be seen. 
The Altar features a magnificent selection of bronze ritual vessels, including ornately engraved bowls from the tomb of Lady Meng Ji, which have survived from the Seventh century B.C. without a trace of the blue-green rust of oxidization. 
Other objects, such as a gilt silver phoenix crown (17th century), trembling with dragons, phoenixes and flowers, impress by their sheer material splendor. 
The jade burial suit of Princess Dou Wan (200 B.C.) is perhaps the most sensational of all. 
Two thousand jade plaques stitched together with gold thread are deployed to form the body stocking, boots, gloves and mask of a spacesuit-like shroud meant to preserve the body through eternity. 

   "Son of Heaven" will be up in Seattle until Dec. 31. 
On March 1, 1989, it moves to a still-unnamed new exhibition hall now being built in the former Central High School in Columbus, Ohio, where it will stay until Sept. 4, 1989. 

   In the meantime, Mr. Childs and his marketing team continue their campaign to whip up local enthusiasm. 
With a Chinese "lion dance" scheduled for one of the Seattle Seahawks' halftime shows, "Son of Heaven" is certain to achieve its share of notoriety. 
But after all the hoopla, it may be remembered as the exhibit that swallowed its own treasures.

ICHON, South Korea 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 80 years ago a Korean farmer returning from work noticed a curious object 
half-hidden along a red dirt path near his home. He thought the item was a 
piece of jade -- it had the right texture and color. But once he had picked up 
the curio and rubbed it clean, he found a green ceramic duck instead of a 
precious stone. 
</P>
<P>
The duck was in good condition, and its charming shape showed the whimsical 
intent of its maker. 
</P>
<P>
People in the country had no use for such items, so the farmer went to town the 
next day and sold his prize -- a perfect Koryo Dynasty (AD 935-1392) celadon 
water dropper. 
</P>
<P>
Serendipitous discoveries such as this were almost routine in early 
20th-Century Korea. The story of the duck-shaped calligraphy instrument is not 
unique. It was just one of several finds that exposed a cache of ceramics 
unlike anything the art world has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Celadon is to Korea what Sevres is to France, Ming to China and Delft to the 
Netherlands. Until 1910, however, the grayish-green porcelains, symbolic of 
South Korea's Golden Age, remained largely forgotten -- buried in aristocratic 
tombs for about 600 years -- until unearthed when occupying Japanese began to 
dig a network of highways throughout the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Since their rediscovery Koryo celadons -- items such as water droppers, hair 
ornaments, square pillows, rice bowls, teapots and wine vases -- have delighted 
connoisseurs. 
</P>
<P>
In South Korea's capital of Seoul, merchants lug wooden carts piled high with 
intricate new inlaid maebyongs (vases with a gourd-shaped top) through crowded 
streets of Insa-dong, Seoul's exclusive antique district, where shops show off 
medieval ceramics from water droppers to wine bottles. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks south in the deluxe hotel region of Myong-dong, expensive 
galleries in underground arcades lure buyers with one or two flawless Koryo 
Dynasty copies. 
</P>
<P>
For a first-time visitor the concentration is dizzying. After a while, however, 
saturation gives way to appreciation. And before you know it, a love affair 
with the soft green ceramics begins. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what distinguishes Koryo celadons is their elegant simplicity. Unlike 
the more flamboyant Mings and Imaris, effects rendered by a celadon maebyong 
are as subtle as a Japanese garden. 
</P>
<P>
The maebyong does not reach out and dazzle the observer as does a Ming; 
instead, it waits. Its appeal stems from an uncontrived balance of color, motif 
and form -- as well as the quiet impression this leaves upon the intellect and 
senses. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea's antique celadons are rare and expensive. Prices vary according to 
quality and demand, but an authentic Koryo Dynasty bowl, even in poor 
condition, is certain to bring $3,000 or more. Foreigners can buy flawed but 
charming antique celadons at Insa-dong galleries. 
</P>
<P>
(You must have government approval if you want to take any curio more than 65 
years old home with you.) 
</P>
<P>
But if it is perfection you want, do not despair. Reproductions crafted in 
mountain kilns using the ancient process make fine substitutes. At city 
galleries and even department stores you can buy copies that rival original 
Koryo ceramics found in the National Museum of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
But they do not come cheap. Vases from potters such as Chi Sun-t'aek and Yoo 
Keun-hyeong -- both national living treasures -- could cost $8,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
If your schedule permits, there is a less expensive way to acquire a celadon 
souvenir. For one-third the cost and three times the fun, you can travel to a 
country kiln and discover what South Koreans mean by "Chosun" or "Morning 
Calm." 
</P>
<P>
South Korea's most popular pottery region is this mountain village of Ichon -- 
about 20 miles south of Seoul, where famous kilns of Koryo-doyo and 
Haegang-doyo, craft splendid Koryo celadon reproductions. 
</P>
<P>
In early fall, country dwellers string red peppers atop roofs in preparation 
for the kimchi festival (when Korea's staple of hot and spicy pickled cabbage 
is celebrated) as workers push for an abundant celadon harvest before the 
frigid winter sets in. 
</P>
<P>
Ichon's kilns keep busy, and when its storerooms bulge with pots, you can seize 
a masterpiece for a fraction of its gallery value. And better yet, the beauty 
of the Korean countryside is there for the seeing. 
</P>
<P>
Fluffy white clouds cap mountains and pepper hills with shadows as if imitating 
subtle designs on a 12th-Century celadon vase. In the valley, the harvest nears 
and the rice stands tall. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers dressed in white carry heavy loads of produce on their backs and 
gracefully walk red dirt paths as if being carried down terraced hills on a 
wave of grain. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what distinguishes South Korean celadon from that of the Sung Chinese 
lies in these simple pastoral scenes. The graceful lines and sensuous forms 
come from familiar objects -- a melon, a gourd, a bamboo shoot, a reed. The 
spirited motifs -- ducks playing among reeds, cranes soaring through clouds -- 
arise from landscapes lyrical and naive. 
</P>
<P>
Good celadon reproductions follow the same painstaking process of the Koryo 
period. First, the best clays are selected and taken to the kiln site. 
Preparation of the clay is important, for unless a suitably plastic condition 
is achieved, the finished product will appear rough. 
</P>
<P>
Also, without the proper mixture of clays containing kaolin and petuntse, a 
Chinese discovery called the "bones and flesh" of porcelain, celadons would 
crack at the high firing of 1,300 degrees centigrade, and the soft, green glaze 
would never fuse with the body. 
</P>
<P>
Twisting up and down Ichon's mountain roads, you encounter kiln upon kiln. 
</P>
<P>
In one room, an artisan with Popeye-sized forearms throws a slab of gray earth 
onto a spinning wheel and -- presto -- a shape is born. In another, 12-year-old 
apprentices carve intricate designs onto "leather-dried" pots, while older 
artists inlay chiseled crevices with white or black slip, depending upon the 
master potter's whim. The day that storerooms fill with trimmed pots the real 
feat begins -- the glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Of Koryo celadon's three distinguishing features (shape, design and glaze) the 
latter is the most important and the hardest to achieve. It is perhaps the 
delicate serenity of the celadon glaze -- never opaque, always soft and 
transparent -- that most distinguishes the beauty of Koryo pieces. 
</P>
<P>
How a color so lush could emerge from elements as common as flower petals, red 
clay and wood ash is a factory secret. While the precise composition of the 
iron-oxide-based glaze varies from kiln to kiln, all masters share in one 
tradition -- they reveal their formulas only to their heirs. 
</P>
<P>
The best celadons bake in pine-burning kilns that arch like dormers onto 
Ichon's wooded mountainsides. Some reproductions are fired in electric ovens, 
but modern methods, while more predictive, fail to capture the luster of 
medieval Koryo -- especially the soft sparkle caused by melted particles and 
bubbles imprisoned within the glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Master potters preferring ancient ways heat with pine even though only one in 
10 of their intricately prepared pots will survive. Those that do are 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
If you visit Ichon, you might want to take along a rabbit's foot or two. When 
the kilns begin to smoke, a cloud of superstition wafts across the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that spirits reside not only in humans but in natural forces and 
inanimate objects, Korean potters call on ancient shaman symbols to ensure a 
successful outcome. Some hire mudangs (sorceresses) to perform ceremonies 
(kuts) to shake off demons. Others offer food -- pig's heads on tridents -- to 
get good spirits on their side. 
</P>
<P>
Spells notwithstanding, fall firings are festive occasions. Besides good buys 
(especially on pots judged imperfect for gallery sale), Ichon offers insights 
and experiences not shared in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The best approach to Ichon, 35 miles southeast of Seoul, is via bus tour or 
private car. Your hotel concierge can put you in touch with one of the many 
Korean travel agents who offer day trips to Ichon and nearby Kwangju 
(Kyonggi-do province). 
</P>
<P>
If you are not the bus-tour type, a chauffeur-driven car can be arranged 
through your hotel. Most car-rental agencies, such as Seoul's Hertz-affiliated 
Daehan Rent-a-Car, provide drivers. The daily rate (10 hours) for driver and 
car is $80, plus tolls for the first 77 miles. After that, the rate changes to 
50 cents a mile, plus $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
While foreigners can obtain rental cars without drivers, most do not -- 
especially when traveling outside Seoul. Country road signs are only in Korean, 
so persons not fluent in Hangul are advised to pay the modest chauffeur's fee. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 kilns are spread out along the Kwangju-Ichon highway. Most feature 
showrooms in addition to factories. The most famous are Chi Sun-t'aek's at 409, 
Sugwang-ri Shindun-myon, Ichon, and Yoo Keun-hyeong's at 323-4, Sugwang-ri, 
Shindun-myon, Ichon. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to pottery, Ichon is noted for its hot springs. Just off the main 
highway at 313-5-Anhung-ri, Ichon-up, is the town's famous resort spa -- Hotel 
Seol Bong. 
</P>
<P>
Besides offering some of Korea's best spa facilities, the hotel features both 
Western and Korean cuisine.

<TEXT>
   Archeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old
burial site containing 40,000 pottery figurines in the ancient
capital of Xian, said a report seen Wednesday in Beijing.
   The site is estimated to contain more than five times the number
of terracotta figurines found buried with the first Chinese
emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di, whose tomb is also in Xian, the Xinmin
Evening News of Shanghai reported Tuesday.
   The discovery of the ancient army of terracotta warriors
guarding Qin's tomb was one of the great archaeological finds of
modern times. It has turned Xian, in western China, into one of the
country's major tourist attractions.
   The newly discovered burial site dates to the Han dynasty, or
between 206 A.D. and 220 B.C.
   Archaeologists have uncovered 11 pits the past two months, the
newspaper said. Each pit measures an average of 13 feet wide, 23
feet deep, and dozens of yards long, the newspaper said.
   The more than 300 figurines excavated so far are all male, naked
and about 24 inches tall, it said. Each was exquisitely crafted
with smooth, flowing lines and attention paid to such details as
eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, ears, hairstyle and muscles, it said.
   Experts believe that bits of silk cloth that were also found at
the site indicate the figurines originally were clothed in silk,
but their costumes have disintegrated over 2,000 years, the
newspaper said.
   Qin's terracotta army was discovered by peasants from a local
commune who were digging a new well to irrigate their parched soil
in March 1974 following a winter drought.
   Hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists visit Xian each year
to see the museum built around the pits containing the colorfully
dressed, life-size terracotta figures of archers, infantrymen and
cavalry, which guard the emperor's tomb, about two miles away.
   The terracotta warriors have yielded invaluable clues to the
dress, weaponry, military organization and physical appearance of
the era.
   Pieced together by experts, the armored warriors and their
horses, stand in formation, rank by rank. Each of the sand-colored
statues has a different facial expression and hair style.
   The finds over the years have included bronze and wooden
chariots, a variety of weapons, as well as drums and gongs used to
give command signals to troops in battle.
   The museum is about 20 miles east of Xian, now the capital of
Shaanxi Province, a city of 2.9 million people, about 660 miles
southwest of Beijing.
   Starting point of the ancient Silk Road to the West, Xian and
its environs was the cradle of Chinese civilization under 11
dynasties from the 11 century B.C. to 907 A.D., when the city was
the largest in the world with more than 1 million people.
   Qin unified scattered Chinese kingdoms into a single nation in
221 B.C. and died a year later.

   Two small pyramids built for the wives of Pharoah
Pepi I were discovered under mounds of sand by French scientists
who say the find could shed light on a dynasty that ruled Egypt
more than 2,000 years before Jesus was born.
   The discovery was announced Friday by members of the French
Archaeological Mission at Sakkara and scientists from Electricite
de France, the state-owned utility which conducted a high-tech
exploration at the site about 20 miles south of Cairo.
   The Sakkara site contains the step pyramid built by King Zoser,
said to be the first stone structure in history, and other
pyramids. The discovery of the queens' tombs brings to 85 the
number of known pyramids in Egypt.
   One pyramid is in ruins, but the second could contain
subterranean funeral chambers decorated with hieroglyphics, said
Jacques Montlucon, who led the utility's team.
   In the 19th century, the 50-acre Sakkara site served as a quarry
from which stone was taken for building in Cairo. For the last 25
years or so, extensive digging around the pyramid of Pepi I has
left a field of rubble at the site.
   ``It looks like a battlefield there,'' said Montlucon, adding
that the pyramids were covered by ``eight meters (about 26{ feet)
of rubbish.''
   ``In such disturbed land, it would be practically impossible to
find anything, to know where to begin to dig, without our current
technology,'' he said.
   Last summer Montlucon supervised the conservation of artifacts
retrieved from the wreck of the Titanic.
   He said the electromagnetic tests used at Sakkara were developed
by the French utility for conducting geophysical tests at potential
nuclear reactor sites.
   Using test results, the team put together a map pinpointing five
possible pyramid sites. Three sites were then excavated.
   The first hole revealed a highly decorated mastaba, or tomb, of
a dynastic official. Weeks passed before workers finally hit the
stone of a pyramid on Feb. 12.
   ``I was in the big pyramid when the foreman came running in
shouting `Mabrouk!' (congratulations),'' Montlucon said. ``I felt
so happy I could have cried.''
   Workers dug out a ``buttonhole'' through which they could see a
segment of the pyramid wall, smooth and gold in color. The French
archaeological team will ask permission from the Eygptian
Antiquities Organization to begin full excavation next year on the
pyramid, thought to be 66 feet tall and 66 feet at the base.
   The find is ``a big gain for Egyptology'' and ``will allow us to
know more, possibly a great deal more, about the 6th Dynasty'' that
ruled the Nile Valley from 2420 to 2258 B.C., Montlucon said.
   Archaeologists are hoping the pyramid contains hieroglyphic
inscriptions that can be added to the Pyramid Texts, the oldest
writings known to man. The archaeologists also hope the writing
will reveal the name of the pharaoh's wife, shrouded by the
centuries, who is buried there.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Xia: "Successes Mixed With </F>
Anxiety"] 
  [Text] The distinctive cultures of the 55 minority 
nationalities in China are preserved on paper, stones, wood or 
just plain passed on orally from generation to generation. 
  "This is an indispensable part of the treasure-house of 
China's history, and it is urgent to rescue and protect this 
precious heritage," said Li Dongsheng of the State Nationalities 
Affairs Commission (SNAC). 
  China has always attached great importance to protecting 
minority culture. 
  As far back as 1952, Premier Zhou Enlai suggested collecting 
and publishing ancient books of ethnic minorities. But due to 
the ensuing political chaos, the work did not start until the 
1980s. 
  In August 1984, upon State Council approval, the 
Nationalities Affairs Commission started to prepare for the 
collection and research of ancient books of minorities published 
before the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). 
  Offices, research centres and publishing houses were set up 
in 24 provinces and autonomous regions, with money coming from 
regional revenue. 
  Generally, ancient books refer to those written before the 
Qing. Since some minorities have a short history, books written 
in their language before 1949 are also included, according to Li. 
  These books cover a wide range of fields: philosophy, 
literature, history, astronomy, medicine, architecture, music 
and painting. 
  Research found that the Yi nationality boasts 10,000 volumes 
of ancient publications. A book on medicine, included more than 
370 prescriptions. Investigations show it was finished 17 years 
earlier than the Compendium of Materia Medica, a world-famous 
book on medicine written by Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty 
(1368-1644). 
  Mongolia and Man nationalities, founders of the Yuan 
11271-1368) and Qing dynasties, left large numbers of official 
documents in addition to folk tales. These documents have 
far-reaching significance in historical studies of the two 
dynasties. 
  The collection and publication of these books help minority 
nationalities better know their own history. 
  It also signifies the equality of all nationalities. 
  "The work, however, is tough and urgent," said Li Dongsheng. 
  Few people are expert at all minority languages. 
  Naxi nationality, scattered in the Lijiang area of South 
China's Yunnan Province, created a hieroglyph called the Dongba 
character. It got its name from its use to record religious 
rites by Naxi celebrants, called Dongba in the local language. 
  Only a few old Dongba can read these pictographic 
characters. 
  In 1981, an institute was established in Lijiang to rescue 
the precious cultural relics of Naxi nationality. The institute 
invited several old Dongba as instructors and provided 10 
university graduates for them. 
  With it the pronunciation and content of more than 1,000 
Dongba books have been recovered and more than 300 books have 
been translated into Mandarin Chinese. The books also disclosed 
eight Dongba rituals. 
  Some minority nationalities, on the other hand, do not have 
written languages. Their history is passed down orally. 
  In the past decade or so, the Snac has invested money and 
manpower to recover their history, legend and folk tales. 
  From 1986 to 1990, more than 1,000 books about 30 
nationalities were published, their academic value attracting 
world attention. 
  Research institutes of Chinese minorities have also been 
established in Japan, the United States, India, Canada and 
Germany. 
  During the past 10 years, more than 1,000 foreigners have 
visited the Dongba culture research institute in Lijiang. Two 
foreign students are studying in the institute for their 
doctor's degree. 
  A national conference on the collation of ancient 
nationality 
books will be held this year, according to Li. At the 
conference, relevant rules and regulations will be worked out to 
provide long-term guidelines for the work. 
  Li said the collection and collation work needs to be 
further 
improved. 
  In the past decade, both the central and local governments 
have provided financial help to the collection and collation of 
these books, Li said. In the future, more money is expected to 
be allocated to meet the increasing need. 
  On the other hand, local research institutes should actively 
tap resources on their own to collect funds, Li suggested. 
  Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region set a prime example in this 
regard. In recent years, it has cooperated with the People's 
Republic of Mongolia and Australia on minority nationality 
cultural studies. Many books in the Mongolian language were 
jointly published by them. 
  There is a lack of professional personnel in the collection 
and collation work. Until now, no university has set up this 
major. Only short-term training classes have been opened at the 
Central University for Nationalities, according to Li.

A SCHOLAR AND A SCIENTIST COMBED THROUGH ANCIENT SCROLLS THAT RESULTED IN NEW 
FINDINGS ABOUT EARTH'S ROTATION AND THE DAWN OF CHINESE CIVILIZATION.

Buried deep in an ancient Chinese book called "The Bamboo Annals" is a passage 
about an unusual double dawn nearly 2,900 years ago: "In the first year of the 
reign of King Yi, in the first month of spring, the sun rose twice in Zheng." 
</P>
<P>
The passage describes what is believed to be a solar eclipse viewed in the 9th 
Century BC from the now-dead city of Zheng. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries, scholars have seen this terse report as a strange but minor part 
of the annals, an ancient history book discovered by grave robbers 1,700 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
But from this passage, Chou Hung-hsiang, a professor of Chinese at UCLA, and 
astronomer Kevin D. Pang of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory launched an unusual 
two-year search that has led to a series of findings about the Earth's rotation 
and the dawn of Chinese civilization. 
</P>
<P>
By matching Chinese astronomical records dating back 3,900 years with computer 
simulations of the movements of the Earth and moon, they have determined the 
rate of the planet's gradually slowing rotation within thousandths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Their report was published recently in the British journal Vistas in Astronomy. 
While other researchers have done similar studies using Arabian and Babylonian 
eclipse records, none have been able to go as far back into history as Chou and 
Pang. 
</P>
<P>
According to their research, the length of a day was 22-thousandths of a second 
shorter in AD 532, 42-thousandths of a second shorter in 899 BC, and 
70-thousandths of a second shorter in 1876 BC. 
</P>
<P>
Using the same method, the two researchers believe they also have established 
or confirmed the dates of several events in Chinese history. 
</P>
<P>
Their research focused on the period when China was divided into the Shang, 
Zhou and Xia kingdoms, known collectively as the Three Dynasties. Scholars have 
never been able to determine the exact time of their rule and many question 
whether the Xia Dynasty even existed. 
</P>
<P>
But by matching astronomical records with historical accounts, Chou and Pang 
believe they have determined the reign of several rulers in the Three Dynasties 
period and the beginning of the legendary Xia Dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
Chou and Pang began their search after hearing about research to determine the 
planet's rotational speed using Arabian and Babylonian eclipse records. 
</P>
<P>
They knew the same could be done with Chinese accounts, and that it would take 
the research much further back into the past. 
</P>
<P>
Out of thousands of eclipses recorded over the centuries, they chose three that 
fell outside of the years covered by Arabian and Babylonian accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The first step was to determine an approximate date for the eclipses, since 
there are no recorded dates in Chinese history before 841 BC. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the double dawn, the task was easy, since King Yi was only two 
generations removed from that time. By assigning 30 years for each generation, 
they estimated the first year of King Yi's reign to be around 901 BC. 
</P>
<P>
By using JPL's computers, they simulated the movement of the Earth and moon 
backward through time toward the double dawn. 
</P>
<P>
While they found hundreds of eclipses within a century of that date, there was 
only one, which occurred on April 21, 899 BC, whose path was in line with the 
city of Zheng. 
</P>
<P>
"You could go forward 2,000 years and backward 2,000 years and you wouldn't 
find another one," Pang said. 
</P>
<P>
There was one problem: If they assumed each day was exactly 24 hours, the 
eclipse should have occurred 5 hours and 48 minutes later and would have been 
seen in the Middle East instead of China. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy was caused by a phenomenon that astronomers have long known 
about: that each day, in fact, is not exactly 24 hours long. Because of 
atmospheric friction, tidal action and the movement of molten rock in the 
Earth's core, the planet's rotation has been gradually slowing, meaning that 
days were slightly shorter in the past. 
</P>
<P>
To put the eclipse over Zheng 2,900 years ago, Chou and Pang calculated that a 
day had to have been 42-thousandths of a second shorter than today. 
</P>
<P>
Using the same method, Chou and Pang analyzed an eclipse recorded in the 
1,400-year-old History of the Northern Wei Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first year of the tai-chang reign period (of the reign of King Chu), on 
the day xin-you (the 58th day in a 60-day cycle), or the first day of the 10th 
lunar month, the sun from beneath the Earth eclipsed and began to wane from the 
southwestern horn." 
</P>
<P>
They set the date of the eclipse at Nov. 13, AD 532, and calculated that the 
length of the day was 22-thousandths of a second shorter than today. 
</P>
<P>
The final eclipse that Chou and Pang studied is the oldest recorded in Chinese 
history. 
</P>
<P>
According to the 6th Century BC "Book of Documents," a compilation of 
historical treatises on the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, the eclipse took 
place during the fifth year of the reign of King Zhong Kang, the fourth king of 
the Xia Dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"On the first day of the last month of autumn, the sun and the moon did not 
meet harmoniously in fang (the fourth lunar mansion). The blind musicians beat 
their drums and the lower-ranked officers and common people bustled and ran 
about." 
</P>
<P>
The passage provided several important clues. The eclipse was seen in a part of 
the sky known as fang, which roughly corresponds to the location of the 
constellation Scorpio. It was viewed in the last month of autumn, which in the 
Xia calendar is the same as modern month of October. 
</P>
<P>
The computer again found hundreds of possible eclipses within a few centuries 
of the estimated date of King Zhong Kang's reign. 
</P>
<P>
But only one was visible from China during October and located exactly in the 
fourth lunar mansion of fang. "It satisfied all the criteria," Pang said. "It 
was the only one possible." 
</P>
<P>
Pang and Chou set the date of the eclipse at Oct. 16, 1876 BC, which would put 
the beginning of King Zhong Kang's reign in the year 1881 BC. 
</P>
<P>
There are no other eclipses recorded before King Zhong Kang's time, but there 
was an unusual clustering of planets that allowed Chou and Pang to journey even 
further back in history to the origins of the Xia Dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
The five-planet conjunction, described in the Gu Wei Shu, a 2nd Century BC 
compilation of astronomical writings, was of one of the most spectacular in 
recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
"During the reign of King Yu (first king of the Xia Dynasty), five planets 
lined up clearly like a string of pearls, brightly burning like joined jade 
disks." 
</P>
<P>
Chou and Pang ran a computer simulation of planetary orbits back through time 
and found that Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Mars and Saturn did indeed cluster in 
the sky above the Xia capital of Yangcheng on Feb. 23, 1953 BC. 
</P>
<P>
"It has never been that close and never in that straight a line," Pang said. 
"You could put your thumb up and it would block them out." 
</P>
<P>
Their simulation matched a previously published report by David W. Pankenier, 
assistant professor of Chinese at Lehigh University, that proposed 1953 BC as 
the beginning of the Xia Dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be very exciting if we finally know the beginning of Chinese 
civilization," said K. C. Chang, professor of Chinese archeology at Harvard 
University. "Their findings are of great interest." 
</P>
<P>
Chou and Pang believe they will be able to date a few more points in the 
chronology of the Three Dynasties using other Chinese accounts of astronomical 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Pankenier has already used a similar technique to date two other planetary 
conjunctions that he believes establishes the fall of the Shang Dynasty shortly 
after 1059 BC and the end of the Xia Dynasty around 1576 BC. 
</P>
<P>
But modern researchers are far from unanimous in accepting any of these dates. 
</P>
<P>
David S. Nivison, a retired professor of Chinese philosophy at Stanford 
University and an expert on the chronology of the Three Dynasties, said that 
using ancient Chinese texts is fraught with problems. 
</P>
<P>
Erroneous words have been copied into the texts, events have been distorted for 
symbolic purposes, and efforts by ancient historians to reconstruct the past 
have created gross errors. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding this problem is that most historians have only a limited 
understanding of astronomy, and most astronomers have little skill in wading 
through the complexities of ancient texts. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the problems, Nivison and others say that using modern astronomical 
techniques to date the past holds enormous promise and, except for the 
discovery of new archeological finds, may be the only way to recover the 
long-lost chronology of the Three Dynasties. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is going to be a lot more agreement in the future over dates 
because of the use of scientific methods," Nivison said. "But don't 
underestimate the ability of scholars to argue and argue and argue."

<HEAD>4,000-Year-Old Funeral Boat Gently Moved into Elaborate Museum
Tomb Scene</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 4,000 years after it was built, the
funeral boat of one of Egypt's most powerful pharaohs takes another
journey this week.
   The delicate, 32-foot long, wooden craft was gently lifted off
the floor of the Field Museum of Natural History on Monday and
rotated 180 degrees. Expert riggers who performed the tricky
maneuver kept their hands off, fearing sweat or body oils would
harm the ancient wood.
   Today, the boat used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in
about 1850 B.C. will be moved inch by inch a few yards to its new
setting in the museum _ a $2.2 million permanent exhibit.
   When the exhibit opens in November, it will allow visitors to
walk through the eerie world of tombs, mummies, shrines to cat
goddesses and other treasures from ancient Egypt. The museum said
the exhibit would give visitors the only opportunity outside Egypt
to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex.
   King Sen-wosret's boat _ a graceful, crescent-shaped canoe-like
craft _ is but one of more than a thousand artifacts and treasures
from the museum's collection used to recreate the burial scenes.
   Visitors enter the tomb chambers of the 5th Dynasty pharaoh,
King Unis, dating to 2400 B.C. and excavated from Saqqara, Egypt,
in 1908.
   Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft takes visitors into
the dark and eerie burial chamber. The sarcophagus is empty. When
it was excavated, the pharaoh's mummy was gone, stolen by robbers
or destroyed by time.
   Leaving the burial chamber, the visitor passes through a roughly
hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into another scene depicting a
variety of Egyptian burial rites.
   ``This could well be the most fascinating part of the exhibit,''
said its developer, Janet Kamien. ``It gives them (visitors) a
chance to explore the age-old mysteries of mummies and life after
death.''
   Next month, the museum staff will move 23 mummies into the
exhibit, along with the accouterments their souls were to take with
them to the afterworld.
   Sen-wosret's boat will be displayed nearby.
   No one actually knows if the boat was used to transport the
king's body across the Nile River to the burial site, said Frank
Yurco, a scholar on ancient Egypt at the Oriental Institute and a
consultant on the museum project.
   The boat was one of six found at the burial compound in 1893-94
by Jacques DeMorgan, a Welsh Egyptologist. Two badly deteriorated
ones were left at the site.
   Two of the four DeMorgan saved are at the Egyptian Museum in
Cairo and the other is at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in
Pittsburgh.
   Sen-wosret is remembered for military campaigns that extended
Egypt's boundary into the Nubian region of Ethiopia and the Sudan,
as well as securing control of the Nile River to the south, he said.
   He also centralized the Egyptian government, setting the pattern
for several hundred years.
   Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, said
Yurco.

   Inch by inch, with the help of expert riggers,
the funeral boat of one of ancient Egypt's most powerful pharoahs
took another journey Tuesday, to a new $2.2 million museum exhibit.
   Hydraulic jacks, dollies and a forklift were used to move the
fragile, 3,847-year-old wooden boat about 50 yards from a display
section of the Field Museum of Natural History to an exhibit
designed to recreate a pharoah's tomb.
   ``It went very well,'' said Suzanne Santos, a museum spokeswoman.
   Before the move, the 32-foot boat _ a graceful craft resembling
a canoe _ was gently lifted off the floor and rotated so it was
pointing south to its new destination, Mrs. Santos said.
   Riggers who performed the tricky maneuver had to keep their
hands off, so no sweat or body oils would harm the ancient wood.
   The boat, used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in about
1850 B.C., now becomes part of a new permanent exhibit called
``Inside Ancient Egypt,'' which opens in November.
   The actual moving of the boat took about an hour, Mrs. Santos
said.
   The ancient craft has been at the museum since 1900, and for at
least a dozen years has been encased in glass in a room with other
Egyptian artifacts.
   ``It was your typical museum collection,'' Mrs. Santos said.
   The new exhibit will give visitors a feel for ancient Egypt,
though glass will still prevent any direct contact with the boat,
she said.
   The exhibit will give visitors their only opportunity outside
Egypt to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex, with two
burial chambers, mummies and a shrine to the cat goddess Bastet,
the museum said.
   King Sen-wosret's boat is among more than 1,000 artifacts to be
displayed.
   Visitors will enter the tomb chambers of Unis-ankh, son of the
5th Dynasty pharaoh Unis. The chambers date to 2400 B.C. and were
excavated at Saqqara, Egypt, in 1908.
   Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft will take visitors
into the dark burial chamber itself. The sarcophagus is empty. When
the tomb was excavated, the mummy was gone, probably stolen by tomb
robbers.
   Leaving the burial chamber, visitors will pass through a roughly
hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into a series of Egyptian burial
scenes featuring dioramas, 23 mummies and other artifacts.
   ``It gives (visitors) a chance to explore the age-old mysteries
of mummies and life after death,'' said the exhibit's developer,
Janet Kamien.
   Sen-wosret's boat was one of four excavated in 1894 from his
tomb at Dashur by Jacques DeMorgan, a Welsh Egyptologist, the
museum said. Two are at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and the other
is at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.
   No one knows if Sen-wosret's boats were used to transport his
body across the Nile to the burial site, or if they was buried near
the tomb for use in the afterlife by the king's soul, said Frank
Yurco, a scholar on ancient Egypt at the Oriental Institute and a
consultant on the museum project.
   Sen-wosret conducted military campaigns that extended Egypt's
boundary into the Nubian region of Ethiopia and the Sudan, as well
as securing control of the Nile River to the south, he said. He
also centralized the government, setting the pattern for several
hundred years.
   Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, Yurco
said.

<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ancient mummy of an aristocratic
young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in a plaster death mask, has
been unearthed in a shallow pit at the foot of the Great Pyramid of
Cheops.
   ``She's really lovely,'' said Aly Hassan, director of pharaonic
monuments for the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. Hassan dated
the mummy as 4,400 years old, one of the earliest ever found in
Egypt.
   Egyptologists expressed surprise at Thursday's discovery, noting
the Giza pyramids area has been looted repeatedly since antiquity
and excavated by some of the greatest archaeologists of the last two
centuries.
   Hassan said the seals of the grave were intact when an
antiquities inspector accidentally found the burial shaft.
   Officials who entered the grave found the mummy. She wore a
bronze crown covered with gold leaf on her head and jewelry around
her neck.
   Jewelry, pottery, wooden items, a piece of glass, flint,
obsidian, a clove of garlic and more than a dozen teeth lay nearby.
The wood and garlic may have been placed in the grave to keep
insects away.
   The mummy was not identified, but Hassan said the woman's
nobility was established both by the finery buried with her and the
site of her burial, a cemetery reserved for officials of the ruling
court.
   She was about 22 years old when she died and stood five feet
tall, Hassan said. He said the body dates from the Fifth Dynasty,
which lasted from 2465 B.C. to 2323 B.C. He said he dated her body
from that dynasty because other bodies in the cemetery were from
that period.
   Her body is so dried out that it has been wrapped in foam for
protection and bound beneath the head.
   Zahi Hawass, director general of the Giza area, said the new
mummy might have been an important person reburied for safekeeping
in the shaft where she was found.
   Two vast cemeteries lie under Giza Plateau, one with royal tombs
to the east of the Cheops pyramid. To the west lies the one with the
new mummy, put into use five years into the reign of Cheops 4,600
years ago.
   Inspectors have identified the owner of the complex in which the
shaft was found as S-ankh Ptah, but his position under the pharaohs
and his relation with the mummy remain mysteries.
   Egyptologists hope the mummy can provide clues into early
mummification, an art of preservation that spanned more than 3,000
years of Egyptian history into Christian times.
   ``Any find in the Giza area in such a condition is a great
addition to archaeology,'' said Hassan. ``This mummy changes our
concept of preservation and mummification and provides a new date
for (it).''
   The earliest true mummy is that of Waty, found in the tomb of a
court singer called Nefer at Sakkara. Waty's mummy dates from the
late Fifth Dynasty and was preserved so well by resin-soaked
bandages that even a callus on the sole of a foot is visible.
   Egyptians mummified their dead for thousands of years and was
refined over the ages using a solution of naturally occurring
preservative compounds.
   An obstacle to unraveling mysteries that still surround the
mummification process is that the ancients left incomplete pictorial
records of the embalming ritual.
   Some say the art of mummification was too sacred to be revealed.

FT  05 JUN 93 / Collecting: Jewels from the East - Susan Moore welcomes an
upcoming feast of Oriental art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON TUESDAY, Eskenazi unveils the latest in a long line of spectacular and
scholarly Oriental art exhibitions to celebrate the gallery's move from a
first floor in London's Piccadilly to a five-storey 'Flemish Renaissance'
townhouse off Bond Street, at No. 10 Clifford Street. The acquisition and
refurbishment of the building cost in excess of Pounds 5m and is an
expression of confidence all the more striking given that Eskenazi has no
English clients.
The old premises in Foxglove House afforded no storage space, no room for
parallel exhibitions and inadequate wall space for the extensive library.
The restored 1897 facade of Clifford Street belies an imaginative,
purpose-built interior of some 12,000 sq ft. There are two gallery floors,
divided front and back to offer up to four independent exhibition spaces.
Moveable, free-standing showcases provide maximum flexibility.
A pool of natural light is brought to the heart of a once gloomy, narrow
building by a new atrium. Natural materials have been chosen throughout:
blond sycamore, French limestone, glass. The effect is cool, airy and
meditative.
For the new gallery, Giuseppe Eskenazi envisions more exhibitions (there
have already been 36 in the last decade), including loan shows, and
'symposia or anything which might interest academics'.
For him, the new building is also 'my way of showing my commitment to
London'. When he left Milan to open a London office of the family firm of
Oriental art dealers in 1960, London was the undisputed capital of the art
world. Thirty years on, and thanks to the arguably short-sighted policies of
the auction houses which now move objects around the world to offer them in
their primary markets, it has become just one important centre as Hong Kong
and New York have come to rival it in the Oriental art market. But Eskenazi
believes London still retains the trump card of unrivalled expertise - in
its museums, universities and art trade.
Significantly, Oriental art is one of the few markets in which the auction
houses have failed to wrest the biggest business from the hands of a small
group of top international dealers. Eskenazi may have no English clients,
but it claims the third highest turnover of any London dealers. In 1991-92
that was some Pounds 18.5m, a huge sum in Oriental terms.
Eskenazi's inaugural show is 'Early Chinese Art from Tombs and Temples'
(June 8-July 9). Some 48 works of art, from a Shang bronze of the 12th-11th
century BC to a Song or Jin wood Bodhisattva of the 12th-13th century AD,
have been selected to represent the breadth and quality of the gallery's
holdings. Collectors with deep pockets will be delighted to find that a
number of prize rarities have been extracted from the company collection.
'We are selling things we had no intention of parting with', says Eskenazi.
Notable among the highlights is an unusually large and superbly modelled
recumbent bronze ox of the Eastern Zhou period (4th-3rd century BC), inlaid
with scrolls of silver. A partial inscription states that it belonged to the
state treasury of an unknown king. From the Tang dynasty comes a sumptuous
silver reliquary, a vigorous glazed earthenware horse biting its knee and an
imposing amphora, 68cm high, streaked with a sancai glaze of cream, green
and chestnut. Most examples are half its size.
'Japanese Netsuke from the Carre Collection' also goes on show, June 15-July
9. The 243 pieces reflect the collector's particular fascination with the
folklore of Japan, a subject illustrated so effectively by the netsuke
craftsmen.
Another inaugural show also features a single-owner collection. Swiss dealer
Patrick Syz, formerly of Sarzi-Amade in Bond Street, opens as a private
dealer at No. 94 Eaton Place, London SW1 (tel: 071-235-4572) with an
admirable if highly specialist show. He presents 92 of the finest examples
of Japanese sword fittings, or tsuba, from the collection of the American
Henry D. Rosin, June 10-25. 'It is said to be probably the finest, small,
concise collection outside Japan,' Syz says modestly. Prices Pounds 500 to
Pounds 60,000.
Barry Davies Oriental Art (1 Davies Street, London W1) presents no less than
three shows this month, June 12-25. 'Inro - One Hundred Selected
Masterpieces' draws from a number of well-known collections. Its star turn
is a 'truly spectacular' unrecorded inro (a small, decorative container worn
from the belt) by Shibata Zeshin, probably the greatest 19th century
Japanese lacquer artist. This unusual piece takes the form of a wicker
basket in polished black lacquer which contains three fitted gold lacquer
boxes.
A second show introduces the contemporary Japanese lacquer artist, Unryuan,
whose Togidashi work of different coloured rubbed lacquers is hailed as fine
as anything produced in the 18th century. At Pounds 4,000 to Pounds 60,000,
it is certainly as expensive. Complementing his work is a small display by
the English contemporary netsuke carver, Guy Shaw.
More netsuke are to be found at Sydney L. Moss (51 Brook Street, London W1).
'Zodiac Beasts and Distant Cousins', which shows June 9-July 2, focuses
around a group of 12 wood animals by the Gifu/Nagoya masters, Tomakazu and
Ikkan.
A far wider selection of Oriental and South East Asian wares - including
bronze, ivory, lacquer, cloisonne, pottery and porcelain, glass, soapstone
and textiles - is to be found at The Oriental Art Gallery's summer bonanza,
4 Davies Street, from June 8. Most notable is a group of Ming and Qing
Imperial lacquers.
Spink's Far Eastern show, 5-7 King Street, London SW1, until June 18, for
the first time includes a significant group of Korean ceramics - far more
rare than their Chinese and Japanese counterparts. Outstanding among the
exhibits is an 18th century Choson Dynasty blue and white porcelain brush
pot sparely decorated with a continuous landscape under a full moon. Prices
Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 200,000.
Christie's, meanwhile, exhibits 118 pieces from the collection of Chinese
ceramics amassed by the Hong Kong dealer Robert Chang (until June 15). This
is a gloriously old-fashioned collection of flashy, brilliantly coloured and
finely potted wares which reflect the re-emergence of taste for late Qing
Imperial porcelains in the Hong Kong of the 1970s and 1980s.

   He was an ancient Egyptian turncoat,
backbone of the pharaoh's government one day and strong right arm
of the conquering Persians the next.
   Most of what the world knows of Udjahorresnet comes from
inscriptions on his statue in the Vatican collection, which boast
of his calculated opportunism and the power his treachery won him.
   But it's a tale without an end _ the finale missing, the last
lines obscured.
   Now, in the depths of a desert burial maze, Czechoslavak
scientists are finding clues to the fate of one of pharaonic
Egypt's dastardly personalities.
   Almost 60 feet down, at the foot of a central shaft cut through
soft petrified clay and filled with sand, the team discovered a
burial chamber.
   ``What a shock to see his name, Udjahorresnet, in such an
unexpected place, away from his home'' in the Nile delta, ``away
from his Persian connections,'' said Miroslav Verner, head of
Egyptology at Charles University in Prague.
   ``It was thrilling,'' Verner said. ``His name is what all
Egyptologists learn first when they study the Persian takeover of
Egypt. ... He was a dark personage, a man known for his betrayal.''
   Verner has been field director since 1976 of a Czechoslavak
archaeological mission in Abusir, an ancient burial and religious
center 18 miles southwest of Cairo.
   Mission scientists discovered a series of rubble-filled shafts
in 1981 on a site misidentified 150 years earlier as a pyramid
ruin. Verner's 10-man team and colleagues from the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization began excavating last November.
   Udjahorresnet took few chances in life and fewer in death. The
maze of shafts he commissioned used a traditional method for
repelling robbers by filling shafts with sand, and was more
intricate than others found in Egypt.
   He was a trusted official of the 26th-dynasty Pharaoh Psamtik
III, then turned up as colonial administrator after Cambyses of
Persia conquered Egypt in 525 B.C.
   Little is known of Udjahorresnet's later life.
   ``The last we knew of him, he was leading an Egyptian army to
help the Persians under Darius I, Cambyses' son, put down internal
strife,'' Verner said. ``Then he disappeared from history. The
final lines on his statue are damaged unreadably and no tomb was
ever found.''
   That obscurity may be about to end.
   In the limestone chamber at the bottom of the Abusir shaft,
excavators found a megalith-sized sarcophagus sheltering an inner
coffin with decorated sides. They bore the name Udjahorresnet.
   The chamber held neither a mummy nor major funerary articles,
but Verner said team members found five small statuettes with the
names of Udjahorresnet and his parents, and a list of his titles.
   Since the 1960s, the pyramid-domed sands of Abusir have yielded
several major finds to Czech archaeologists: the oldest papyri
found in Egypt, the oldest hall with standing columns and several
spectacular statues dating from the fifth dynasty, more than 4,000
years ago.
   Once considered a stepchild of its famous neighbor, the Giza
Plateau, Abusir became one of Egypt's most exciting archaeological
sites.
   Because of his important titles _ Egypt's chief physician and
overseer of the royal navy and Greek mercenaries _ Udjahorresnet
would have been ``a man in the know when the Persian invasion
came,'' Verner said.
   ``History doesn't record his exact role,'' the archaeologist
said, ``but the next thing we know after Egypt's defeat is that
this man was part of the Persian regime, close to Cambyses: his man
in Egypt, you might say, highly rewarded for his new loyalty.
   ``Udjahorresnet even boasts ... that he put together Egyptian
titles for the new Persian ruler. He was a 100 percent quisling, an
opportunist.''
   His statue, obtained by the Vatican collection 200 years ago, is
thought to have left Egypt with the Roman Emperor Hadrian early in
the second century.
   Hadrian was a restless traveler and protector of the arts who
appropriated the beautiful and strange to adorn the imperial villa
at Tivoli near Rome.
   The architect of Udjahorresnet's tomb used sand, in an
hour-glass effect, first to lower the massive sarcophagus and then
to seal the passages, Verner said. The burial chamber's roof
contained holes with clay pots beneath, which the last worker broke
one-by-one as he left through a side shaft so sand would flow in
from a shaft above, the archaeologist said.
   At least four grave-robbing forays were made into the shaft, the
latest in medieval tims. Verner said robbers finally tunneled
through the soft rock and penetrated the basalt coffin by using
fire and water alternately to weaken it.
   ``During their robberies, the thieves lived in the shafts,'' he
said. ``We know all about them from rubbish they left'' and the
soot from their fires.

   Even death couldn't free some workers
from their bosses, archaeologists are finding in a newly discovered
cemetery near the pyramids.
   It's the first burial ground ever found for the Egyptian working
man of 45 centuries ago.
   Five other cemeteries with 4,000 tombs flank the pyramids, on
the horizon above. But all 4,000 were reserved for royalty, their
families and officials, said Zahi Hawass, director-general of
antiquities for the pyramids area and the new dig's excavation
chief.
   ``What we haven't found until now is the working class,'' said
Hawass. ``We were shocked when we looked at inscriptions of who was
buried in the new tombs. Overseers holding their sticks. And
behind, skeletons of workers.''
   He said it appears the workers were members of the foremen's
crews.
   The first eight tombs, three miles south of the Sphinx, lie at
the base of sand hills stretching endlessly into the desert. Hawass
said the cemetery undoubtedly extends deep into the dunes.
   Tombs date from the fourth dynasty - 4,600 years ago when the
Giza pyramids were built - until the sixth, 300 years later. It's a
mysterious period when legend says workers grew tired of almighty
pharaohs and of building pyramids for them.
   Because no middle-class burials had been discovered on sacred
Giza plateau, some Egyptologists have theorized that the afterlife
was perceived as off-limits to the working man. But the new
cemetery proves that pharaonic blue-collar workers prepared for
eternity as their betters did, being buried with amulets, limestone
tablets, offering tables, pottery vessels and more.
   The largest tomb, built for a fifth-dynasty overseer named
Ptah-Shepses, is 20 feet by 6{ feet with an arched ceiling.
   To the rear of the tomb, in a honeycomb of compartments,
excavators found six skeletons buried in the fetal position. Hawass
said they were members of one work crew.
   Ancient Egyptians didn't practice human sacrifice, so the
workers were not killed and buried at the same time as their
bosses. And Hawass said there's no indication so far how a foreman
chose the workers to be buried near him.
   ``Perhaps they were his favorites. Or perhaps we'll find others
when we keep digging,'' Hawass said. ``We have no idea how many
people an overseer would have had on his staff.''
   Foremen handled day-to-day administration of the pharaohs'
estates, with responsibilities comparable to farm managers or
assembly-line supervisors in today's world. ``They dressed better,
ate better and wanted better tombs than the men who worked for
them,'' Hawass said.
   ``They looked at the pyramids and the fancy tombs of the
officials. They knew they couldn't afford such luxury. Still they
wanted a nice place to spend eternity.''
   More information about the ancient blue-collar workers will come
from medical tests Egyptian doctors are performing on the
skeletons. Data is expected to indicate the workers' general
appearance, their height and weight, what they ate, what diseases
bothered them, even what killed them.
   In 1987, Hawass and Egyptologist Mark Lehner of Yale University
began a search for homes of workers who built the three Giza
pyramids. At a site some distance from the monuments, they
uncovered ruins of a business center and other artifacts.
   They stopped excavating in early 1988. The recently discovered
tombs lay undetected only a few feet away.
   But early last summer, a tourist hired a saddle horse for a ride
around the pyramids. During the tour her horse fell through the
sand, ending on top of what proved to be the roof of the first
tomb.
   Nobody got the tourist's name, and chances are she still doesn't
know her outing made history.
   For years, riders heading for the most spectacular view of the
pyramids have passed in front of the Sphinx and through an ancient
stone gate into the desert.
   No records existed to explain the gate.
   But ``once we found the cemetery we understood,'' Hawass said.
``The gate divided the world of the pharaohs from the world of the
average man.''
   He explained that the foremen and their crews lived and were
buried in their own world behind the gate. By day they passed
through the gate into their pharaoh's sacred world, then returned
at sunset to work on their own tombs.

CERAMIC SHOW GIVES TRANQUIL VIEW OF CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer

<TEXT>

News from China for the past few weeks has been so unsettling that one is 
hardly prepared for the exquisite calm that pervades "Imperial Taste: Chinese 
Ceramics From the Percival David Foundation." The rare traveling show of works 
from a renowned London-based collection, at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art through Sept. 17, is about as far as one can get from the China of recent 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Three curators -- George Kuwayama of LACMA, Tung Wu of the Boston Museum of 
Fine Arts and Rosemary Scott of the Percival David Foundation -- have selected 
58 works from a collection of 1,400 for the jewel-like exhibition. "It's a bit 
of everybody's favorites and a representative group from the collection," Scott 
said at a press preview. "The American curators had an eye on things that are 
not in American collections or rarely seen here, and I pointed out the most 
important pieces in the collection." 
</P>
<P>
Decision by committee? Perhaps, but the show doesn't suffer for it. Though 
works span the 9th to the 18th centuries and styles run from modest to 
flamboyant, the exhibition is a tranquil, sensibly ordered survey. If it 
accomplished nothing else, "Imperial Taste" would serve as a quiet reminder 
that China is a cultural powerhouse despite its turbulent history and extended 
blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
That power comes on with a whisper in 9th- and 10th-Century vessels of definite 
shapes and indefinite colors. This Yue ware (gray-bodied stoneware) includes a 
small grayish vase shaped like a pair of upright fish, a green-gray spittoon 
far too lovely to use and a silvery bowl delicately inscribed with two 
phoenixes. White basins and dishes from the Ding kilns in Hebei province look 
rather like embossed objects, subtly covered with scrolling floral motifs. 
</P>
<P>
A 7-inch-tall guan (official) vase from the Southern Song Dynasty is considered 
"the perfect example of its type," according to Scott, because of its graceful 
shape, pale blue color and a cracked pattern that complements the form. 
</P>
<P>
Such examples of understated beauty suggest that ceramics was a pure art form, 
but others undermine that notion. One 13th-Century vase with notched corners, 
for example, emulates a jade tube, while another vase is patterned after a 
bronze. Both offer evidence of a 13th-Century fascination with the archaic, 
Scott said. Another work that isn't quite as simple as it seems is a 
yellow-glazed porcelain table screen. Though it appears to depict a rooster 
looking for lunch in a garden, it's actually a pun that offers a wish for a 
successful career in government. 
</P>
<P>
Ceramic decoration becomes more complex as the show moves into the 14th 
Century. Monochromatic forms give way to cobalt blue and white porcelains 
sporting convoluted dragons, a wine jar with beaded outlines and lattice-like 
floral reliefs, and various fussy teapots. One of the most elaborately 
decorated pieces is an enamel-painted porcelain dish with the gods of 
happiness, rank and longevity painted in the center and a ring of leaf-shaped 
panels depicting birds and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the objects in the show were owned by Chinese emperors and have 
inscriptions to prove it. The late Sir Percival David acquired them over a 
20-year period beginning in the late 1920s. His wife, Lady David, writes in a 
catalogue essay that he was "a born collector" who first visited China in 1924. 
"He instantly became so attracted by the Chinese tradition of art 
connoisseurship that he determined to study it in its highest manifestation, 
the Imperial Collection," which was displayed rather haphazardly in the 
Forbidden City in Beijing. With the blessing of Chinese officials, Sir David 
financed the renovation of a building in the Forbidden City, staged an 
exhibition of the collection there and published a catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
He went back to Britain in 1925, but returned to China in 1927 when rumors 
indicated that parts of the collection might be for sale. According to Lady 
David's rather vague account, Sir David arranged to buy 40 pieces in an 
on-again-off-again deal that involved hostile competitors and the temporary 
jailing of a Japanese dealer who helped him. Those 40 objects are the core of a 
collection that presently numbers 1,400. In 1950, Sir David gave the collection 
and a library on Chinese ceramics to the University of London. The collection 
is now housed in a historic house in the Bloomsbury district of London where it 
is open to the public on weekdays.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- Kaesong is situated 
160 kilometres south of Pyongyang. 
  Kaesong is attracting tourists because it was the capital of 
the Koryo Dynasty (918-1392), a unified state which existed 
nearly 500 years and it is the home of Koryo Insam (ginseng) and 
a city near the Military Demarcation Line. 
  There are many scenic spots in and around the city. 
  Among them are Pakyon falls, one of the three best water 
falls in Korea, historic remains such as the wall on Mt. Taehung 
and the Taeung hall of the Kwanum temple in its neighbourhood. 
Beautiful mountains, strangely shaped rocks, crystal-clear 
water, fascinating waterfall blend well with the time-honoured 
historic remains, presenting a wonderful beauty and taking the 
fancy of the visitors. 
  Preserved in their original state in the city are more than 
100 important historic monuments belonging to the Koryo Dynasty, 
among them the Koryo Songgyungwan academy, the South gate of 
Kaesong, the Sonjuk bridge, Manwoldae (the site of the royal 
palace), Chomsongdae and the Anhwa temple. 
  Drawing particular attention of the tourists are the tombs 
of 
King Wang Kon, the founder of the Koryo Dynasty, and King 
Kongmin, its 31st king. The tombs show well the excellent grave 
architecture of the Korean nation. 
  Panmunjom that is still a place of showdown between peace 
and 
war belongs to Kaesong municipality. 
  Situated there are the conference room of the military 
armistice commission, the room of Korean armistice talks and the 
hall where the armistice agreement was signed on July 27, 1953 
and the evidences of those days. 
  Visible at Panmunjom is the concrete wall built in the area 
South of the Military Demarcation Line, which divides Korea into 
the North and the South. The wall stretching more than 240 
kilometres from the east to the west across 8 counties divided 
122 villages and cut off 3 highways and upwards of 220 roads 
and railway lines. 
  The visitors to the city can see at first hand and purchase 
the real Koryo insam and its processed goods, widely known as 
the elixir of life. 
  Tourists can board and lodge in Korean style at the national 
hotel. And they can taste Yakbap, ball-shape Kimchi, roasted 
chicken with Kaesong insam inside it and Kaesong insam wine 
peculiar to Kaesong. 
  Foreign tourists spend a good time, guided by the kind 
officials of the international travel company of the DPRK.

FT  05 DEC 92 / Arts: The orient survives in Mayfair - Lean times for some
dealers are opportune for others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOUNT Street and adjoining Davies Street in London's Mayfair boast the
highest concentration of top oriental art dealers in the world. The last
year, however, the royal warrant holder, John Sparks Ltd (established
1888)closed and Barling of Mount Street (established 1946), which dominated
the Chinese furniture market, ceased trading in June; Japanese ceramics
specialists Helen Buxton Ltd locked their doors for the last time last month
and other famous names are conspicuous for their lack of activity - and
stock.
Barling's proprietor Nicholas Grindley believed his most positive response
to a threatened 110 per cent rent increase was to call in the receiver. He
plans to return to business as a private dealer. Helen Buxton found that her
diminishing profits could no longer justify the expense of a shop. She
decided to sell most of her stock at auction, reinvest at new prices, and
deal from home.
Five former antique shops now sit empty on the south side of Mount Street.
Moreover, the arrival of Jacuzzi showrooms and hairdressers seems set to
change the character of one of the most elegant and exclusive shopping
parades in Europe. Of the oriental art dealers, only Speelman and Oriental
Bronzes Ltd remain. Landlords and financial backers are proving a far
greater threat to London's dealers during this recession than the auction
houses ever were.
However, lean times for some are also opportune times for others wishing to
make the move to Mayfair. In the last year, for instance, the asking rental
for the Sparks shop, arguably the best in Mount Street, has dropped over
Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 64,000 per annum for a full repairing lease. Last
month, Pelham Galleries, distinguished furniture dealers, left the Fulham
Road to re-open at Nos. 24 and 25 Mount Street, and a promising new venture,
The Oriental Art Gallery, opened its doors at No 4 Davies Street. Kensington
Church Street dealers are also rumoured to be off to Davies Street.
This week sees the inaugural exhibition of The Oriental Art Gallery Ltd. The
firm's directors - and proprietors - are Gerard Hawthorn, formerly of Sydney
L. Moss, and virtually the entire old oriental department of Spink: Roger
Keverne, Ben Janssens and Miranda Clarke. Some three years ago, Messers
Hawthorn and Keverne had attempted to take over the troubled John Sparks
Ltd. Its demise, they believe, has left a gaping hole in the marketplace for
a general oriental art dealer. In their new enterprise they aim to keep
their inventory as large and as diverse as possible.
The 127 pieces on show reflect this strategy. Objects range from an archaic
Chinese bronze food vessel or ding from the late Shang Dynasty (12th/11th
century BC) to porcelain, glass, silver, furniture, lacquer, ivory, jades
and other carved hardstones, cloisonne enamel, and textiles. There is even
the odd Indian or Khmer sculpture. Most of the pieces are fresh to the
market and among the finest of their type - however modest. Prices range
from Pounds 525 to Pounds 28,000. The exhibition opens on Wednesday.
Eskenazi, in contrast, opens a valedictory show, the last at its present
gallery. In the spring the firm moves to its own building, No. 10 Clifford
Street, off Bond Street. While The Oriental Art Gallery offers something for
everyone, this exhibition focuses on one of the most subtle and recherche
fields of collecting: early Chinese lacquer.
Almost all of the pieces on offer come from the collection of the late
Jean-Pierre Dubosc, a notable scholar-cum-dealer- cum-art adviser. It was in
Japan during the 1960s that he began to appreciate the quiet beauty of early
Chinese lacquer, then little appreciated. He encouraged museums to assemble
notable holdings; part of his own is already in the Asian Art Museum in San
Francisco.
Lacquer is a time-consuming, precise art. The 14th century Yuan period red
lacquer dish decorated with melons and heavily veined foliage, for instance,
was probably painstakingly built up and carved over a period of years. Each
thin layer of lacquer could only be applied when the previous one had dried
slowly to the correct consistency. The beguilingly simple Song period
(11th-12th century) dish in the form of a seven-petalled mallow flower is
the show's tour-de-force of exquisite understatement. It is as light as a
wafer, and far more agreeable to handle than chilly porcelain, a medium
lacquer greatly influenced.
Today, the tables have turned and lacquer is far less valuable than
porcelain, although - or perhaps because - it survives in far greater
quantities. Prices range from Pounds 12,000-Pounds 90,000. The show runs at
Foxglove House, 166 Piccadilly, W1, December 8-22.
Back at No. 96 Mount Street, Christian Deydier of Oriental Bronzes shows a
spectacular Han Dynasty (206BC-AD 220) bronze horse for one day only,
December 8. This noble beast, 1.27m high, was one of perhaps two or four
tomb horses made to accompany a chariot. He is for our delectation only; he
cost 'many millions' and has already been sold.
At Spink's, meanwhile, Michael Spink has returned to the family firm as
director in charge of the South East Asian, Himalayan, Indian and Islamic
departments. This month sees the firm branching out to offer Arts and Crafts
British jewellery for the first time. At 5-7 King Street, St James's, until
December 24, is jewellery by the likes of the Gaskins, George Hunt, Sybil
Dunlop, Mosheh Oved and Omar Ramsden - plus an entirely new discovery, Maud
Eastman.
Highly wearable are Sybil Dunlop's 'Carpet of Gems' jewels - richly coloured
semi-precious stones, boldly set and redolent of Indian jewellery. Her
rectangular brooch set with green and pink tourmalines, fire opals and
citrines in the form of a vine, of around 1925, is yours for Pounds 2,500.
Maud Eastman's necklace of faceted rock crystal, rose quartz and beads is a
delight - and a more reasonable Pounds 1,500. Prices start at Pounds 750.
Her necklaces are more feminine versions of those by the contemporary
sculptor-jeweller Breon O'Casey, hand-cut out of lapis lazuli, amber,
moonstone and carnelian. O'Casey's jewellery has a powerful, primitive
quality, and is on show at the Oxford Gallery (23 High Street, Oxford) until
January 6. Prices Pounds 280-Pounds 3,900.

<LEADPARA>  Archaeologists digging in the jungle of Guatemala have found the tomb and
remains of an eighth-century ruler who they believe began the policies of
militarism and territorial expansion that eventually led to the collapse of
the classical Maya civilization.;    Dr. Arthur A. Demarest, an archaeologist
at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, announced Tuesday that the discovery
was made beneath the ruins of a pyramid at Dos Pilas, the ancient capital of
the Petexbatun region of Guatemala.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  TEAM SAYS IT FOUND TOMB OF WARLIKE KING WHO
DESTROYED MAYAS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The tomb contained the skeleton of a man accompanied by a regal headdress
of jade, conch and pearl, obsidian blades probably used in bloodletting
ceremonies and ceramics inscribed with hieroglyphics.;    King's burial site; 
Scholars at the site said they were almost certain that the skeleton is that
of Ruler 2, so called because the hieroglyphics giving his name have not been
deciphered. A monument at the pyramid indicates that this is the burial site
of that particular king, and the writing on pottery found inside the tomb is
expected to confirm the skeleton's identity.;    "It looks like we've got a
large dead king in there," Demarest said in an interview by telephone from
Guatemala.;    The tomb's discovery, along with excavations of extensive
fortifications at Dos Pilas and other evidence of relentless warfare, is
expected to figure in new interpretations of the Mayas as a more militaristic
people than had been thought by earlier scholars.;    It could also illuminate
the causes of the mysterious fall of lowland Mayan culture beginning in the
eighth century and culminating in the 10th.;    Militaristic past;  "This is
going to change the textbooks radically," Demarest said. "Ruler 2 was a
pivotal figure in the initiation of the catastrophic sequence of events in
which the polity broke up into a dozen warring states that militarized the
landscape within a period of 50 years and may have destroyed the ecology of
the region.";    Ruler 2 reigned between 698 and 725 over the Petexbatun
region, which spanned some 2,000 square miles along the Pasion River in
northern Guatemala. Ruler 2 and his successor conquered neighboring
city-states and created the largest kingdom in Mayan history. The Mayas'
classic period began with the rise of large cities and elaborate ceremonial
centers around A.D. 250 and, in the south at least, collapsed by the year
900.;    Other archaeologists said this was one of the most significant recent
discoveries in Mayan studies. But many of them were not yet prepared to accept
Demarest's interpretation that a rapid escalation of warfare and territorial
expansion doomed the Mayan civilization.;    Theory disputed;  Dr. Jeremy A.
Sabloff, an authority on Mayan archaeology at the University of Pittsburgh,
called Demarest's research "very important and exciting" but said he doubted
that a single factor, like destructive warfare, accounted for the fall of the
Mayan civilization.;    Dr. David Webster, an archaeologist at Pennsylvania
State University who specializes in Mayan warfare, said the discovery "will
tell us a great deal about the dissolution of these kingdoms and about the
role of warfare in this dissolution.";    Excavations at Dos Pilas, Webster
said, focused attention on a major shift in scholarly attitudes toward the
Mayan culture. Until recent years, scholars tended to idealize the Mayas as
peaceful and industrious people. The only warfare was supposed to be the
limited, ritualized battles fought between rulers as part of dynastic
struggles, but rarely involving the common people.  </TEXT>

   Much of the curriculum of the Afrocentric movement is
based on teaching guides called the African-American Baseline
Essays, published by the Portland, Ore., public schools. The
essays -- on art, language arts, mathematics, music, social
studies and science -- contend that much of their content has
been deliberately omitted by standard "Eurocentric" texts.
Yet many more-traditional scholars say the essays themselves
contain numerous inaccuracies and distortions. What follows
are some excerpts from the essays.

   "Egypt ca. 3100 B.C. was a Black nation. The first 1,100
years of Dynastic Egypt during the first six Dynasties was a
period of undisturbed Black rule, and was the period when
most of the pyramids (and Sphinx) were built. . . . The great
18th Dynasty re-established Black rule and brought many of
Egypt's most famous personages to power. Akhnetan,
Tutankhamun, Nefritari, Nefertiti, Hatshepsut, and Tutmosis
were among the familiar names. This all means that the art
forms and architecture we relate to Egypt are, in fact, forms
of Black art. . ."
                                                                                                       

   From LANGUAGE ARTS, by Joyce Braden Harris, director,
Black Educational Center, Portland, Ore.:
                                                                                                       

   "Black literature is manipulated and controlled by white
editors and publishers. . . . Black writers who are published
generally receive little or no promotion for their works."
   "The Ten Commandments . . . are very similar in content to
The Negative Confessions {of ancient Egyptian tombs}. . . .
The inscription of Nefer-Seshem-Re of the Sixth Dynasty
provides further evidence of the African origins of the Ten
Commandments."
                                                                                                       

   From MATHEMATICS, by Beatrice Lumpkin, associate professor
of mathematics, retired, Malcolm X College, Chicago:
                                                                                                       

   "Since Africa was the birthplace of the human race, it
follows that Africa was the birthplace of mathematics and
science."
   ". . . Specific examples indicate that ancient Egyptians
were conducting investigations that could have led to the
formation of the so-called Pythagorean theorem. There is hard
evidence that the theorem was known 1,000 years before
Pythagoras."
   "Euclid . . . lived and died in Egypt. There is no
suggestion that he ever left Africa. Yet he is pictured in
textbooks as a fair European Greek, not as an Egyptian. We
have no pictures of these mathematicians, but we could at
least visualize them honestly in costumes, complexions, and
features true to the people of their times."
                                                                                                       

   From SOCIAL STUDIES, by John Henrik Clarke, professor

   "Non-Biblical history . . . indicates that the Hebrews
were not slaves in Egypt. Some of the Hebrews mistakenly took
sides with the enemies of Africa and were punished. This
punishment did not consist of slavery. The Hebrews, like the
Greeks, Romans, Hyksos, and other foreigners, benefited
religiously and intellectually from their sojourn in Africa."
   "Cleopatra . . . was of mixed African and Greek parentage.
If she were alive today, there is no way she could pass for
Caucasian. If living today, she would probably be living in
one of the Black communities in the United States."
                                                                                                       

   From SCIENCE, by Hunter Havelin Adams III, scientist,
Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois:
                                                                                                       

   ". . . The discovery of time, the control and use of fire
. . . tool technology, language and agriculture. Nothing in
the 20th century has touched humanity so totally as those
things which were first accomplished by Africans. . . ."
   "Today the science contributions of the Islamic-African
science tradition are relatively unknown in the Western world
because of the lack of humility of many Medieval European
scholars who diligently imitated, copied and plagiarized the
works of many Islamic scientists."

   Stonecutters squat in the field alongside the outer wall of the Jing Ling tomb, chipping away at large granite blocks. 
Watched over by a marble Chinese lion, they work with hammer and chisel, echoing the work of the 15th- and 16th-century stonecutters who worked on these magnificently crafted Ming Tombs. 
As the 30 or so men strike their blocks, the melody they make rings in harmony with the guide's rendition of his spiel: Chang Ling, Ming, Ding Ling, Ming, Jing Ling, Ming. 

   A cock crows in the distance, a workman with a shovel over his shoulder ambles by, and it is easy to believe that times have not changed much since the days of the Ming Dynasty. 

   The Ming emperors ruled a prosperous and fairly peaceful China from 1368 to 1644. 
When the third emperor moved the capital from Nanking to Beijing he set about finding a proper and peaceful royal burial place, near enough to the capital for fitting ceremonial respect to be paid, but remote enough to discourage curious visitors. 
Geomancers finally chose this forested, mountain-protected valley, about 30 miles northwest of Beijing. 

   Thirteen of the 16 Ming emperors lie here in elaborate tombs, each approached through a series of stylized, symbolic gates, screens and buildings. 
These structures are in various states of repair. 
It appears that the stonecutters are working to renovate Jing Ling, but that is not the case. 
The men are actually shaping stones to be used as the guardrails for a "flyover" (overpass) on the new superhighway being built nearby. 

   Ten thousand visitors a day come to look at the tombs. 
They drive through the Sacred Way, lined with mammoth stone animals and Chinese entrepreneurs hawking orange soda pop, T-shirts, cloisonne bracelets and fur hats. 
Past the Sacred Way, individual roads lead to the tombs. 

   Chang Ling, the oldest and largest of the tombs, has been meticulously renovated, but not excavated. 
All the tombs are easy to spot. 
The double-roofed stele pavilions immediately in front of each grave tumulus were built to command the valley, and their red roofs still dominate the scene. 
It is the names that confuse Westerners. 
The Ming emperors had a personal name and a reign name. 
Each tomb has a separate name, as does the temple within. 
Add to this the change in Chinese-to-English Romanization (Peking to Beijing, Ching-ling to Jing Ling) and it's easy to see why the tombs are referred to by number, chronologically. 
Tomb One (Chang Ling) holds the third Ming emperor, but the first to be buried in the valley. 

   The 10th tomb, Ding Ling, has been excavated and is open to the public. 
After climbing three flights of stairs, visitors can see the magnificent blue-and-white porcelain jars in which oil was set aflame as the tomb was closed (to create an oxygen-free vacuum) and the massive four-ton marble tomb doors that sealed from the inside. 

   Tomb Three, Jing Ling, where the stonecutters work, has not been excavated nor has its exterior been as meticulously restored as that of the first tomb. 
It was built by the fifth Ming emperor, who ruled 1425-35. 
Since most tourists go to the first or 10th tomb, a visit here can be a serene glimpse into Ming history and architecture. 
Once inside the outer walls it is easy to appreciate the peace that the emperors sought. 

   Inside the first courtyard, a triple set of steps leads up to what was once a sacrificial hall. 
The hall is gone, and the expanse of open ground where it was gives a feeling of spaciousness. 
A steep ramp leads up to the stele pavilion, forcing visitors to stoop as they approach the grave site. 

   The pavilion dominates Jing Ling and holds the grave stele, the emperor's flattering "tombstone." 
A hidden passageway connects this building with the actual grave site. 
The emperor does not lie alone in Jing Ling. 
His empress is buried with him, as are 10 concubines. 

   When the tomb is eventually opened it is apt to contain a trove of blue-and-white porcelain like the jars in Ding Ling that inspire feverish whispers among tourists. 
It was during the fifth emperor's reign that this famous porcelain was perfected. 

   Except for developments in porcelain and a penchant for amassing collections (including one of Korean virgins), the fifth emperor made few ripples in history. 
One incident, however, does stand out. 
When the guardian families of Jing Ling village, whose job it was to protect the tomb, cut some trees that the emperor thought important to the beauty and serenity of the site, he had the villagers executed. 

   He might not take kindly to the stonecutters, whose steady chipping helps to build a highway to bring the curious more easily to his tomb site. 
And he would certainly be appalled at the sight of the helicopter poised in a small clearing between the peach and apple orchards that ring Jing Ling. 
It waits to take customers on a noisy flying tour of the Ming Tombs.

   The humiliating removal from power of
Kuwait's royal family has raised questions about how long other
longtime rulers can survive in desert kingdoms carved out by the
swords of their Bedouin ancestors.
   The Iraqi takeover of Kuwait five weeks ago showed the weakness
of its emir and, by extension, of the other five conservative
dynasties running the region's oil-producing states.
   Middle East observers say the winds of political change were
already blowing and that Iraq's seizure of Kuwait has set in motion
forces that will spell the end of the old order _ one way or
another.
   Even the manner in which Saudi Arabia and other monarchies
appealed for help as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gobbled up
Kuwait underlined their inherent weakness.
   The invasion crystalized differences between Arab states and
split them into two camps: pro-Iraqi and pro-Saudi.
   Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and, above all,
Saudi Arabia, had no choice but to line up behind Kuwait.
   After years of playing East against West, they are now
irrevocably linked to the West and the United States, which is seen
by most Arabs as Israel's protector.
   That puts them on a collision course with alien ideas and
Western political values, including a belief in pluralistic
democracy.
   ``Most people in the gulf expect some democratic changes after
this, and most governments are prepared to move. But don't expect
them to go the whole hog, establishing parliaments and the like,''
said Brian Pridham, director of Exeter University's Center for Arab
Gulf Studies in England.
   ``These regimes won't even consider it, and I'd hate to think
what would happen if they did.''
   Saddam's actions also have sharpened the Arab world's focus on
economic imbalances _ oil states that sit atop fabulous wealth,
while most states are deep in the red.
   ``The Kuwaiti Revolution of Aug. 2 has sounded the alarm bell
for other Kuwait-type regimes. It signaled a radical change of
system ... a new political era in the Arab Gulf region,'' the
official Iraqi News Agency declared.
   Even if Iraq is forced out of Kuwait and the deposed al-Sabah
family restored, it would be the status quo ante.
   ``It will not be possible for Western democracies to reinstall a
demonstrably non-democratic system in Kuwait,'' said Pridham.
   ``There will certainly be changes, some checks and balances,
some forms of democracy in an Arab style which will vary from state
to state,'' he said.
   Democracy is rare in the Arab world. Of 17 Arab states,
including Kuwait, six are secular dictatorships and six are
aboslute monarchies. Only five have introduced some minimal
elements of pluralism.
   Political evolution in the Arab world is slow. Neither Islam nor
Arab nations have democratic traditions. The six gulf kings are
remnants of the emirs, shieks and shahs who ruled throughout the
region for centuries.
   Libya, Egypt, Iran, Yemen and Iraq were all ruled by monarchs
who have been killed or ousted by coups since 1952. All, like the
dynasties of the gulf, had ruled with the support of Britain and
other colonial powers. Some were even hand-picked in London.
   But the gulf dynasties have hung on to power. Several can trace
their roots back more than 300 years.
   The emirs rule more or less benevolently. Some of the kingdoms,
observers say, are among the best governed nations in the Middle
East.
   Thanks to oil revenue, people enjoy a high standard of living
and a measure of personal freedom. The press may be censored, but
reporters are not hanged.
   Gulf sheiks wield power with an 18th century sense of noblesse
oblige, but no concessions to the democratic reforms sweeping much
of the rest of the world. They rule by edict, forbid political
parties, and reject popular governing bodies.
   Blessed with huge oil reserves and small populations, the rulers
have shown enough social concern and material largesse to keep most
subjects happy.
   Bahrain and Kuwait experimented with popular assemblies, but
they didn't last long. Elections and parliaments in an Arab context
are often looked upon as foolhardy steps toward chaos.
   ``Just look at Lebanon,'' Pridham said, ``That's what they think
democracy looks like in the Middle East ... These regimes were
horrified at the changes that swept Eastern Europe.''
   Moreover, recent elections in Jordan and Algeria saw Islamic
fundamentalists make significant gains, a specter that haunts gulf
rulers who have embraced many aspects of Western life.

   On a brisk fall weekend, thousands of people
streamed up a stone stairway to a 350-year-old tomb honoring the
man who, far more than microchips or management systems, created
modern Japan.
   The tomb of Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa and a gold-encrusted shrine
sit in a forest 70 miles northeast of Tokyo. The shogun was
promoted in death from man to god and is known as Gongen-sama,
``Protector of the Realm.''
   For many visitors, the journey may be just an opportunity to
view the autumn foliage, but another impulse sends even retired
people and young couples with toddlers up the 530-foot stairway.
   ``Wherever you go in Japan, there's evidence of the Tokugawa
era, so a lot of people are curious to see this place,'' said
Tsuchiyasu Kiyomitsu, a 30-year-old businessman who rested as other
visitors rang a long-corded bell and paid obeisance.
   The big-bellied shogun was a warlord of legendary willpower who
completed the unification of Japan in 1600 and virtually cut it off
from the world.
   Japan's isolation lasted 268 years, and the family dynasty he
founded deified Tokugawa after his death to help legitimize itself.
   During the long period of isolation, Japan created its own brand
of capitalism, including the world's first futures market (in
rice). It also refined the group behavior that still distinguishes
Japanese society, scholars say.
   Under the Tokugawas, Japan began evolving the paternalistic,
protected-market economy that has confounded policy makers in
Washington, inspired Japan-bashing around the world and helped make
the small archipelago very rich.
   Not surprisingly for Japan, where families routinely trace their
ancestry back for centuries, the Tokugawa legacy exists in the
flesh as well as in folklore.
   Had the dynasty not been overthrown in 1868, the man who might
be shogun today is Tsunenari Tokugawa, 50, current head of the
family. He manages North American operations for Nippon Yusen, a
Tokyo-based shipping company.
   ``Basically, everything that you call Japanese, our weaknesses
and our strong points, many of them in a sense matured in this
260-year period,'' he told an interviewer in his Tokyo office.
   ``Maybe we matured too strongly,'' he added with a smile,
referring to international criticism of Japan's economic practices.
   Tsunenari Tokugawa, a child of postwar egalitarian Japan, gave
an embarrassed laugh about his aristocratic lineage and pointed out
that he goes to work every day like any other ``salaryman.''
   The executive, whose wide eyes and broad face resemble portraits
of Ieyasu Tokugawa, acknowledged that he and other scions of old
feudal families often discuss the imprint his ancestors made.
   ``Whether we like it or not, we are still living under the long
line of Tokugawa influence,'' he said. ``That includes many, many,
many things: the way we think, the way we form teamwork, our system
of education.''
   Perhaps the most enduring legacy developed from a clever method
Ieyasu Tokugawa and his descendants used to stay in power, scholars
say. They kept the feudal domains they controlled off balance by
forcing each daimyo, or lord, to spend half the year in Tokyo.
   This created a nationwide capital network, since money had to
move in and out of Tokyo to support the pilgrimages.
   Fierce competition arose between domain governments and group
allegiance developed within them. The competition led each domain
to promote industry and agriculture, in part to pay for the
expensive journeys.
   ``The domain governments were strongly paternalistic,'' wrote
Marius Jansen, a Princeton University expert on Tokugawa Japan.
   ``They instituted monopolies in whatever was profitable for
export (to other domains). It is no accident that one of the great
modern firms, that of Mitsubishi, had its origins in such an
administrative arrangement.''
   Friends and colleagues tease Tsunenari Tokugawa about the
``shogun business'' he must attend to. On each anniversary of
Ieyasu's death, he goes to the Nikko shrine and dons the
traditional court costume.
   This year, the government called upon him to help celebrate the
400th anniversary of Tokyo, the city Ieyasu founded and made the
capital of Japan.
   Every March 1, Tokyo fishermen practice one of the more obscure
traditions binding Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa to modern Japan. They
deliver a load of fresh whitebait to Tsunenari's home as
compensation for the fishing rights his ancestors granted theirs.
   ``These things are not really for the Tokugawa family,''
Tsunenari Tokugawa said. ``In a sense, it's in order for them to
prove their identity.''

   Iranian Princess Safiyeh Firouz, an activist for
women's rights in her country under the Pahlavi dynasty, died this
week and was buried Thursday, family members said. She was 87.
   The princess, widow of Prince Mohammad Hussein Mirza Firouz of
the Qajar dynasty, died after being hospitalized Monday night with
heart trouble, a family member said.
   She was interred outside the French capital, where she had lived
in exile since the 1979 Iranian revolution.
   Princess Firouz fought in the 1940s for the right to vote for
Iranian women, at one point leading a march on the Majlis, the
Iranian Parliament. Opposed to wearing the veil, she established
the Council of Women in Iran in 1943.
   The princess' husband, a general, was the grandson of Qajar King
Muzaffar ud-Din Shah. The dynasty was overthrown in 1925 by Reza
Shah, father of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and founder of the
Pahlavi dynasty. The dynasty was toppled by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini in 1979.
   Prince Mirza Firouz died in 1983.

<HEAD>Volcanic Eruption That Gave Rise to Atlantis Legend Dated by NASA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A volcano that inspired the legend of the
lost civilization of Atlantis triggered summer frost, crop failure
and famine a half a world away, scientists said.
   The link enabled NASA scientists to date one of the most
powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history.
   Ancient Chinese annals tell how the climate was disrupted about
3,600 years ago after what scientists now know was the eruption of
Santorini volcano, which destroyed much of the Aegean island of
Thera, near what became Greece.
   The eruption was dated to 1600 B.C., give or take 30 years, by
researchers headed by astronomer Kevin Pang of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Pang presented the findings Tuesday during an American Geophysical
Union meeting.
   ``Not only are we able to get a date for this eruption _ if
people agree on the same century that's pretty good _ but we now
actually have eyewitness accounts of what happened (to the weather
thousands of miles away in China) after the Thera-Santorini
eruption,'' Pang said.
   NASA said effects of Santorini's blast were felt around the
world, and Thera's destruction is believed to be the source of
Plato's story of Atlantis, which tells of an island civilization
submerged by the sea after being shaken by earthquakes.
   ``Recent archaeological studies suggest that `Atlantis' may have
been Minoan centers on Crete, destroyed by tidal waves from the
Thera-Santorini eruption,'' Pang said.
   U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist Bob Tilling called Pang's
study ``kind of neat. He has another line of evidence linking
climatic effects to that eruption. ... We need to get a better idea
of how often these large eruptions take place and whether there is
any pattern to them. That gives us a much better basis to forecast
possible future eruptions.''
   Pang said Santorini's eruption packed the punch of ``2 million
Hiroshima atomic bombs going off at the same time. Santorini was
roughly 100 times more powerful than Krakatau (Indonesia, 1883).
Mount St. Helens is a little bitty volcano compared with this.''
   Pang and NASA called the Thera-Santorini explosion the most
powerful volcano eruption in recorded history. Tilling said he was
unsure of the latest estimates, but ``it is clearly one of the
largest.''
   The volcano spewed sunlight-blocking debris and acid aerosols,
chilling Earth's climate to cause disturbances noted in historical
accounts of the reign of King Jie, the last king of the Xia
dynasty, which is China's earliest recorded dynasty.
   ``At the time of King Jie, the sun was dimmed,'' the annals say.
``Three suns appeared (due to ice crystals in the atmosphere
refracting the sun's image). ... Winter and summer came
irregularly. ... Frosts formed in the sixth month (July on the
Chinese calendar). ... The five cereals withered. ... Therefore
famine occurred. ... There was heavy rainfall and communities were
destroyed.''
   Cold wet summers also were observed following massive eruptions
of Indonesia's Tambora in 1815, Iceland's Laki in 1783 and another
Iceland volcano in 208 B.C., Pang said.
   After finding references to Santorini's climatic effects in the
Xia dynasty histories, Pang and his colleagues dated those
references using Shang Dynasty ``oracle bones'' _ genealogies
inscribed on tortoise shells and ox shoulder blades _ and Western
Zhou royal genealogies.
   The genealogies previously were dated by linking astronomical
events to the reigns of certain kings. In one case, Pang found a
historical account of a day that dawned twice that must have been
April 21, 899 B.C., when dawn was interrupted by a solar eclipse.
   Pang said previous studies used volcano-caused excesses of
sulfuric acid in ice cores from Greenland to estimate Thera erupted
happened between 1670 B.C. and 1620 B.C., compared with his date
range of 1630 B.C. to 1570 B.C. Stunted growth rings in Irish oak
trees and North American pines put it between 1613 B.C. and 1631
B.C.
   ``Some date it as late as the 14th century B.C. and some date it
as early as the 18th century B.C.,'' he said. ``Now all the methods
are converging on the late 17th century B.C.''
   Pang conducted the study with physicist Santosh Srivastava and
computer scientist Robert Keston of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and
Hung-hsiang Chou, an Asian languages professor at the University of
California, Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
   The Boston Museum of Fine Arts is returning to
Egypt some fragments of nine ancient paintings because curators have
concluded the art was stolen from a 15th century B.C. tomb.
   The museum bought the paintings from an art dealer in Amsterdam,
the Netherlands, in 1978 for an undisclosed sum and they are not
considered archaeologically significant, museum officials said
Thursday.
   The artifacts probably will be returned in the spring after a
representative of the Egyptian Antiquities Service comes to Boston
to supervise packing and shipping, said Museum Director Alan
Shestack.
   Shestack ordered research into the paintings last year, after the
museum's Egyptian art department expressed suspicions about the
legality of their origin.
   The museum decided to return the artifacts voluntarily because
they apparently were stolen, smuggled out of Egypt and sold into the
art world, museum officials said.
   The fragments came from the Theban tomb of Minnakht, an official
in the period of Thutmose III, and date to 1450-1420 B.C., said
Timothy Kendall, the museum's acting curator of Egyptian and ancient
Near Eastern art. The tomb is located in the Nobles Tombs at Luxor
in southern Egypt.
   Thutmose was considered the greatest pharaoh of the 18th dynasty,
known for conquests that extended Egypt to the banks of the
Euphrates River and the fourth cataract of the Nile River in what is
now the Sudan.
   The fragments depict men and women bearing offerings, but most of
the figures are only partly preserved, Kendall said. The largest
fragment is about 1 foot long and 10 inches high.
   The Amsterdam dealer who sold the objects to the museum has since
died, Shestack said.

  [Text] Panmunjom, March 3 (YONHAP) -- South and North 
Korean officials were still high-strung despite their 
reencounter Thursday after a four-month break. 
  Seoul's top representative Song Yong-tae compared the break 
to winter hibernation, hoping that inter-Korean relations would 
wake up from winter sleep. 
  Song's North Korean counterpart Pak Yong-su chided they 
wasted one whole season and called for successful conclusion of 
their negotiations within the day. 
  -- Spiked words were exchanged even before the two sides sat 
down for the negotiations. 
  Pak make the first strike after pointing to Song's big 
briefcase. "I only brought a small envelope containing a draft 
agreement because I am intent on reaching an agreement today," 
said Pak, "But I see that you brought a big briefcase and 
obviously have a lot to say about this and that." 
  Song laughed it off, saying he brought the briefcase to take 
home the presents since it's Pak's turn to give the gifts. 
  -- A remark on how Seoul is celebrating its 600th birthday 
immediately met retaliation from Pyongyang who recognizes Koryo 
Dynasty as the first unified Korea. 
  Song explained how Seoul was trying to restore Kyongbuk 
Palace by 1997 to celebrate the 600th anniversary and is 
preparing for the visit Korea year. He went on to say how he 
wants to see foreign tourists travel back and forth between the 
two sides. 
  Pak immediately retaliated Song's historical perspective. He 
described how his country completed reconstructing the tomb of 
King Wangkon, the founder of Koryo Dynasty last January to mark 
his 1,117th birthday. 
  He named Wangkon as the first king of a unified nation as he 
emphasized the historical surroundings linking Koryo to North 
Korea. 
  -- Song changed the subject to just-ended Lillehammer Winter 
Olympics, reminding how the Seoul team won a record-breaking 
number of medals and saying he was sorry to hear North Korea 
could not field its athletes due to injury. 
  He indirectly hinted how an inter-Korean unified team would 
do so much better at international games and urged North Korea 
to open to various exchanges. 
  Song replied everything will go well once the two sides 
exchange presidential envoys. 
  -- Top interest among North Korean journalists was 
apparently 
who Seoul will pick as its envoy. 
  Many asked if the Southern side already decided who is to be 
sent as the envoy while hinting that Pyongyang may choose 
between Kim Yong-sun, party secretary for South Korean Affairs, 
and Vice President Kim Yong-chu.

the Hejaz in 1925. The Hejaz contains the holy cities of Islam _
Medina where the Mosque of the Prophet enshrines the tomb of
Mohammed, who died in 632, and Mecca, his birthplace. Puritanical
Islam prevails.
   Leader of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia has oil

   Bahrain was a British protectorate from 1861 until it regained
independence in 1971. Pearls, shrimp, fruit and vegetables were the
mainstay of the economy until oil was discovered in 1932. By the
1970s the oil was depleted, but international banking thrived.
   Bahrain is firmly anti-Iraqi and since well before the present

   North Yemen and South Yemen merged in May. By merging they
regained their former status as part of ancient Arabia Felix and
the kingdom of Sheba that lasted for 800 years until the 2nd
century B.C. For the next 800 years it was ruled by the Himyarites,
Ethiopians and Persians until Islam arrived in the 7th century. In
1517 South Yemen became part of the Ottoman Empire. Britain seized
Aden in 1839 and the surrounding territory later became a British
protectorate.
   Aden won independence in 1967 after a terrorist campaign, and
South Yemen became the Arab world's only self-proclaimed Marxist
state. The northern Yemen Arab Republic was established in 1962
after an Egyptian-supported revolution ousted the Saudi
Arabian-backed Imam.
   Yemen has said it will abide by the U.N. embargo but seems
sympathetic to Iraq nonetheless.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Studies of Northern Ethnic Minorities Make </F>
Headway"] 
  [Text] Hohhot, January 14 (XINHUA) -- China has made major 
headway in the research of the history of its many northern 
region ethnic minorities, marked by the publishing of many new 
and important research works and the deepening of the extent of 
research. 
  Since 1985, Chinese scholars have completed such voluminous 
works as "The General History of Ancient Ethnic Minorities in 
Northern China", "The General History of Mongols", "The History 
of the Relations Between Northern Ethnic Minorities" and "The 
Cultural History of Northern Ethnic Minorities". 
  Three books by Lin Gan, the noted scholar of ethnic 
minorities -- "The General History of Xiongnu", "The History of 
Donghu" and "The History of Tujue" -- have roused the attention 
of historians, as it cleared up the western migration line of 
the north Xiongnu, the tribal institution of the western Xiongnu 
and the activities of the early Donghu people, all of which 
previously posed major difficulties for historians. 
  In his latest work, "New Points About the Ethnic Minorities 
in Northern China", Lin explored the relations between the 
northern minorities and the Hans in central China, the 
assimilation of the minorities by the Hans and the origin of the 
northern tribes and pushed the research of such significant 
issues to a new height. 
  The history of northern China's ethnic minorities has been a 
topic of great interest to the international historical society. 
Since some 2,000 years ago, in the wide region ranging from the 
northeastern to northwestern ends of China, there have existed 
dozens of ethnic minorities. While many of them, such as the 
Qidan, Nuzhen and Xiongnu, had established their own regimes, 
the Mongols eventually united all of China and started the Yuan 
Dynasty (1279-1368). 
  The history of the northern ethnic minorities is an 
important 
part of the history of China as well as that of the world. 
  In its earlier period starting from the mid-18th century to 
late 1940s, research of the northern ethnic minorities had 
resulted in the publishing of fewer than 200 papers. 
  The 1950s saw the beginning of a new era for the research. 
The three decades thereafter produced many important scholars 
and works, with Ma Changshou and his works on the history of the 
Xiongnu and Tujue as the representatives. 
  The period from the early 1980s represents a golden time in 
Chinese ethnic studies. Publications of the period include 49 
research works, 26 collections of research papers, 12 
collections of historical documents, the Chinese version of 19 
works by authors from Russia, Iran, France and Japan, as well as 
12 books on archaeological discoveries in the region and how 
they reflect on northern ethnic minorities. 
  Based on the findings of an extensive social and historical 
investigation, scholars have completed the histories of major 
nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including 
the Mongols, the Daur, Oroqen and Ewenki. 
  Besides the writing of two books on the history of the 
Mongols, Chinese scholars of Mongolian history also published 
hundreds of research papers in the period. 
  Of these works, the one of the greatest value is the Chinese 
version of the "Secret History of the Yuan Dynasty", translated 
into Chinese by Professor Yi Linzhen from the University of 
Inner Mongolia. 
  Besides providing numerous annotations based on the 
knowledge 
of voluminous ancient documents, Yi has also written a lengthy 
foreword in the Chinese and Mongolian languages for the 
classical historical work written in ancient Mongolian language 
in the 13th century. 
  The work has been partly translated into Japanese and 
published in Japan. 
  In the latest development, a work by the title of "The 
Cultural History of Ancient Ethnic Minorities in North China" 
has been completed by scholars from nine Chinese regions and 
recently published. The book, containing 1.2 million Chinese 
characters, represents the first systematic cultural research of 
the northern nationalities from the angles of folklore, 
archaeology, history, comparative linguistics and art.

   Treasures even greater than those in King
Tut's tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of Egypt.
   ``When I'm asked if there's another Tut's tomb out there, I
always answer at least one, maybe more,'' said Zahi Hawass, director
of the Giza pyramids area outside Cairo and the huge ancient
cemetery of Sakkara, 11 miles to the south.
   ``My guess is we've found no more than 30 percent of what's
buried. After all, Egypt is 97 percent desert. ... We can't begin to
imagine what the sands have hidden.''
   The tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun _ King Tut _ was found almost
intact in 1922 by the British archaeologist Howard Carter.
   It took Carter 11 years more to document the hoard of gold,
semiprecious stones, furniture and knickknacks stuffed into the
makeshift tomb dug into the hills of southern Egypt's Valley of the
Kings.
   But Tutankhamun was a lesser king and the discovery of his tomb
left archaeologists to wonder what treasures might have accompanied
ancient Egypt's great monarchs into the afterlife.
   Some intriguing trophies have eluded both early archaeologists
and their modern successors:
   _Mummies and relics of Pharaoh Cheops, whose pyramid on Giza
Plateau is among the world's best-known monuments.
   _The tomb of the architect Imhotep at Sakkara, where more than
4,600 years ago he built for Pharaoh Zozer a step pyramid, an
architectural feat that quickly evolved into the true pyramid.
Generations of later Egyptians worshipped Imhotep as a god.
   _At least seven tombs of royalty and officials from the New
Kingdom, the era of Tutankhamun and the Ramses line.
   _The tomb of Alexander the Great, the young Macedonian conqueror
who died at the age of 33 in 323 B.C. Records say he wanted to be
buried in Egypt's Siwa Oasis, near Libya, but finally was encased in
a gold coffin in Alexandria, the Mediterranean city he founded.
   _The 50,000-man army of Persian conqueror Cambyses, which
vanished in a sandstorm in 525 B.C. while en route to Siwa to punish
the powerful priests of the temple of the Siwan Oracle.
   Egyptian officials realize the historical value that any of those
finds would entail. But the mammoth job of preserving what is said
already to be the world's greatest national storehouse of
antiquities has halted treasure hunts.
   ``I'm trying to keep what's standing, standing,'' said Sayed
Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. ``What
I'd like to do is to keep what's buried, buried until we can deal
with it. It's usually safer for the pieces not to be exposed to
modern pollutants.''
   As Egypt's population rapidly expands, however, roadways, gas
lines and housing projects unearth a vast ancient legacy just
beneath the ground. Often, excavations are rescue missions.
   Archaeological work in Egypt generally is restricted to the
cooler winter months, and last season's work was filled with
surprises. Giza director Hawass said the results give a glimpse of
what lies ahead when archaeologists begin anew in September.
   In January five magnificent statues that rival the loveliest
artwork the ancient Egyptians produced were unearthed in a pit
beneath the tourist-trampled courtyard of Luxor Temple. Seventeen
more statues, many broken, later were discovered in the cache.
   In March a mummy of a young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in
a gypsum mask, was found on Giza Plateau a few feet from a roadway
through the pyramids.
   Other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses, some found on
sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey, now accessible by
paved roads.
   One area to be surveyed in the fall is Giza Plateau's East
Cemetery, a Pharaonic burial ground for royalty and officials beside
Cheops pyramid.
   ``I'm sure we're going to find an intact burial of a prince or
official, because the area never has been excavated properly,''
Hawass said.
   ``In Sakkara, where we know Imhotep is buried, you don't even
need to have shovels and picks to find tombs. You can just use your
hands, dig in the sand. They're there.''
   Modern man owes rich finds to the ingenuity of ancient priests,
who reburied important pieces to ensure survival during politically
troubled times, Hawass said. These caches, which may explain the
Luxor Temple statues, give clues to what may still be hidden.
   He believes the pyramids area contains at least one major cache
from the reign of Old Kingdom Pharaoh Cheops, whose relics include
the world's largest pyramid, a full-sized boat and an ivory statue
so small it can be held between two fingers.
   ``I think out there is Cheops' mummy, maybe statues, maybe
personal items,'' Hawass said.
   ``Four priests were in charge of their safety, but in the next
dynasty (after Cheops) his memory soured. There was a revolt. His
monuments were damaged, perhaps because he made himself a god.''
   Hawass believes that like the Luxor find the Cheops discovery
will be accidental.
   ``We have magnificent statues of his successors (and) delicate
funerary items of Cheops' mother, ... so we know such things did
exist,'' he said.
   ``One day you'll be digging a power line, or cleaning, and there
they'll be.''
   Hawass thinks chance also may locate the long-sought tomb of
Alexander the Great in Alexandria.
   ``We have early descriptions of his tomb, but Alexandria has gone
through many changes,'' he said.
   ``We're not going to find the tomb, if it even still exists, by
going after it. We'll find it by accident, when somebody's digging a
foundation for a house or installing sewer lines.''
   Hawass insists that people who think incredible discoveries
remain to be found aren't dealing in fantasy.
   ``We've got too much evidence,'' he said: ``Kings without tombs,
places we know existed but never were found.''

   In the Tang Dynasty 1,000 years ago,
boatmen carried rice and supplies to fight the northern barbarians.
Today, boatmen on barges still pass through Huaian, but now they
carry coal and bricks to keep China's great metropolises humming.
   Life goes on, changing but always the same along the world's
longest man-made waterway, the 1,000-mile Grand Canal, which Hua
Yuhua, a local official, describes ``as great a feat as the Great
Wall.''
   In Huaian, a 1,600-year-old town in coastal Jiangsu province,
the canal remains the lifeline.
   Huaian is a bumpy, four-hour drive from the provincial capital
of Nanjing and has no railway.
   ``We have looked to the water in developing our land,'' said the
local radio station director, Wang Ruoyuan.
   Every day about 1,200 barges, some in convoys of as many as 10,
pass through the town's two locks, where they are lowered or raised
about 10 feet.
   Along the shore, a sea of men in green and blue jackets load and
unload the coal, grain, vegetables, oil, roof tile, cotton, lumber
and gravel that traverse the 220-mile Jiangsu stretch from the
Yangtze River in the south to the city of Xuzhou in the north.
   The lucky ones have donkeys, but for most a strong back and
sturdy shoulders are crucial. People strapped to harnesses tug at
carts and wagons. On one bridge, a unique pulley system helps them
up an incline.
   Bicycles weave around bridge-side stalls that sell cabbage,
oranges, soft drinks and sugar cane. Children gather around to
watch an elderly couple puff oats with a hand bellows that fires a
blackened iron pressure vessel.
   Fishermen come by with cormorants perched on bicycle handlebars,
taking the black seabirds to catch fish for them.
   Work on the canal began in the 6th century B.C. But the early
7th century Emperor Yangdi built the main sections, from the
western capital of Luoyang eastward and the north-south channel
linking Hangzhou to Beijing, China's modern-day capital.
   Hundreds of thousands are believed to have been mobilized for
the project.
   Upon its completion, the emperor sailed its length at the head
of a flotilla extending in close file for 60 miles.
   During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), what served as the ministry
of transport was in Huaian, and the city had a population of
200,000, double its current number, town official Hua said.
   The canal fell into disrepair after the Tang Dynasty, but the
Kublai Khan rebuilt it in the 13th century.
   The Communist government, after coming to power in 1949, has
built an extensive irrigation and flood control system to make life
easier for the people of this waterlogged, impoverished area.
   The town fathers also hope Huaian's rich historical heritage
will draw tourists. It was the home to Han Xin, the Han dynasty
(206 B.C.-220 A.D.) general; Wu Chengen, writer of ``Journey to the
West,'' the classic of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and the late
Premier Chou En-lai.
   One small temple along the canal has a statue in memory of the
``washerwoman,'' an upright woman who helped Gen. Han when he was a
poor boy and later refused a reward of 1,000 taels of silver.
   Near that temple, outside their one-room brick homes with
upswept tile roofs, the washerwomen of today are still down at the
canal, hard at work.

Monarchical Dictatorial Tradition"] 
  [Text] Another lonely century. With countless centuries 
behind it, one more century means hardly anything to China. For 
a generation or two, however, a century covers its entire 
life-span. 
  Eighteen ninety-three. Year 19 of the reign of Emperor 
Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. At 21, Guangxu had nominally taken 
over the reins of government for 4 years after coming of age. It 
was a time when everybody, from the emperor to his ministers and 
subjects, was committed to strengthening China. 
  In September, the Shanghai Mechanical Textile Factory, which 
produced 600 bolts of cloth every day, was burned down. Li 
Hongzhang [2621 7703 4545] petitioned for its rebuilding. Cheng 
Xuanhuai [4141 1357 2037] was instructed to go to Shanghai. In 
Hubei, Zhang Zhidong [1728 0037 3159] set up a 
self-strengthening academy offering instruction in four 
disciplines: foreign languages, mathematics, natural science, 
and commerce. Lenin, 23, left Samara for St. Petersburg. 
Tchaikovsky, the Russian musician, died, leaving mankind a 
stream of beautiful music that would never run dry. In Britain, 
textile workers and coal miners went on strike one after 
another. In Spain, anarchists set off bombs in the two cities of 
Santander and Barcelona, probably the first acts of terrorism. 
An economic crisis erupted in the United States. To finance the 
construction of warships for use in military actions against 
China, the Japanese emperor issued an imperial edict cutting the 
salaries of civilian officials by 10 percent and dismissing 
3,000 bureaucrats, thus saving 1.7 million Japanese yen. 
<H5>  Mao Zedong Born Into a Troubled World </H5>
  Mao Zedong was born in a tiny mountain village on 26 
December, a time when China was plagued by domestic strife and 
foreign invasion. The following year China suffered a disastrous 
defeat at sea in the Sino-Japanese War. This convinced Sun 
Yat-sen, the pioneer of democracy, that China must reform across 
the board if it was to strengthen itself. So he set up 
Xingzhonghui in Honolulu. Those were troubled times all over the 
world. The great turmoil wrought on by the desire for survival, 
for development, energized human thinking like never before. 
Because of Lenin's passionate actions in Russia, Marxism became 
a worldwide movement. Mao Zedong was born at the right time. 
Although his successes and failures belong in the past, they 
still help shape China today. 
<H5>  Adopting Marxist-Leninist Theory of Class Struggle </H5>
  A century ago, both China's national sovereignty and 
imperial 
power were in the hands of a weak and incompetent ruler. This 
made a profound impact on young Mao Zedong, rural-born but 
lettered. Every Chinese peasant dreamed about a mansion fit for 
a king, even the Forbidden City with all its splendor. 
  Mao Zedong was no exception. He had read all the classics, 
inheriting lock, stock, and barrel that part of Chinese culture 
in which he had an interest. Since China was then an isolated 
empire, Mao Zedong had no knowledge of any foreign language, 
which prevented him from absorbing much of the fruit of human 
thinking outside China. He benefited the most from the theory of 
class differentiation as presented in popular Marxist-Leninist 
pamphlets and made it absolute. During the age of land 
revolution, this spiritual fruit miraculously turned into a 
material force capable of mobilizing the peasants. 
  After the PRC was founded, the class struggle theory, having 
been made absolute, went international. As a result, China at 
peace remained in isolation for years even as one domestic 
struggle followed another on the home front. What should be 
affirmed is this: Mao Zedong took a firm and hard-line position 
in safeguarding national sovereignty even if it meant isolating 
China and falling out and subsequently clashing with the Soviet 
Union after Khrushchev came into power. 
  From ancient books and historical texts Mao Zedong later got 
to learn even more about the experiences of emperors in 
successive dynasties in subjugating their subjects. He never 
shied away from acting imperial in matters of both style and 
substance, adopting the way of might as well as the kingly way. 
As they said, "The style of Emperor Wen and Emperor Wu was to be 
strict and liberal in turns." From the Yanan rectification 
movement of the 1940's to the anti-rightist struggle, Mao Zedong 
copied the best that literary inquisition in one dynasty after 
dynasty had to offer. Through confession movements effected by 
compulsion, Mao Zedong sought to eradicate unspoken criticism. 
Tragically, the overwhelming majority of intellectuals did not 
set out to slander Mao Zedong out of malice. Instead, they were 
persecuted for speaking their minds. Some were even motivated by 
a desire to curry favor with him. 
<H5>  Mainland Intellectuals Trapped in Historical Vicious Circle </H5>
  Mao Zedong's attack on intellectuals was indeed a huge 
success. Only years later did people realize that he simply 
would not let you have a voice. The only thing he would let you 
do was to listen with respectful attention, not even repeat his 
words. In the anti-rightist movement, some people were attacked 
as rightists precisely because they repeated some of Mao 
Zedong's words as yet unpublished at the time. 
  By the time the Cultural Revolution broke out, people no 
longer knew what to believe. On the other hand, they dared not 
omit a single word. Any documents co-signed by the CPC Central 
Committee, the central military commission, the CPC Cultural 
Revolutionary Committee, and the State Council might become 
wrongly transmitted imperial edicts overnight. Mao Zedong's 
closest comrades-in-arms might end up as conspirators the next 
day. All the masses in every faction in the civil war during the 
Cultural Revolution were blind followers who repeated every 
single one of Mao Zedong's words a thousand times. Many of the 
ways, voluntary and compulsory, in which these people pledged 
their loyalty to Mao Zedong reminded us of the scenes that took 
place under a corrupt monarchy. But Mao Zedong had no qualms at 
all, which goes to show that not even he could break the vicious 
circle in Chinese history (The hopes of the Chinese people rose 
and fell with dynastic succession). If nothing else he admired 
monarchical authority in spite of himself. In his old age he 
genuinely believed his words were the golden truth. 
  After his death, Mao Zedong was roundly criticized by many 
people for his personal conduct. As he himself had said, there 
is no perfect human being, just as there is no perfect gold. In 
all fairness, Mao Zedong was largely free from corruption. He 
was a diligent thinker, determined, courageous, and hardy and 
frugal in his personal habits. He was a precocious military 
commander who took war as his instructor, a propagandist and 
agitator who had a profound understanding of Chinese peasants 
and enjoyed their strong support. In the pre-1949 war years, he 
had a knack for spotting talented people and putting them in the 
right positions. Moreover, he was a charming poet and lover. 
  Certainly many emperors who founded or engineered the 
resurgence of a dynasty also possessed these qualities. In 500 
B.C., King Goujian of Yue was defeated in battle and lost his 
kingdom. Enduring humiliation in order to carry out an important 
mission, he even refused to "eat any grain not grown by himself 
and wear any clothes not woven by his queen." What happened in 
the end? After conquering the Kingdom of Wu, he sentenced Wen 
Zhong to death and sent Fan Li into exile. Goujian went down the 
same road that all other kings and emperors had gone down 
before. In its entirety Mao Zedong's legacy is worth far less 
than the ill-gotten gains of some village chief in China today. 
His inheritance consists mainly of the royalties on his writings. 
<H5>  Paying a Hefty Price for Personality Cult </H5>
  My screenplay "Bitter Love" came under attack in 1981. I was 
particularly taken to task for a minor scene in which the 
leading character, then a child, asked the elder of a temple, 
"How come Buddha's face is black?" The elder replied, "His face 
has been blackened by the incense burned by the worshippers." 
  There is no denying the truth I am referring to: The 
cause-and-effect relationship between the worshipped and the 
worshipper in Chinese history. The Chinese paid a steep price 
for Mao Zedong's personality cult. Years of political struggle 
retarded production growth for long periods of time. The Great 
Leap Forward caused a mass famine. The disillusionment resulting 
from the Cultural Revolution caused a nervous breakdown among 
the entire population. In the end Mao Zedong's face was 
blackened by the incense burned by hundreds of millions of 
worshippers. Then came the Tiananmen incident during the 
Qingming Festival in 1976. Only then did Mao Zedong see his own 
blackened face in tens of thousands of eyes. The man, who had 
been spiritually tough and physically strong, never recovered 
from this episode. 
  Chinese intellectuals in the late 1940's firmly believed 
that 
the Chinese nation would henceforth be strong and the nation 
would prosper and live in peace. They also believed that all 
past, present, and future successes should be attributed to Mao 
Zedong Thought, that Mao Zedong Thought was invincible, and that 
it was the beacon for the people of China and even the whole 
world. In short, Mao Zedong was perceived as an omnipotent god. 
<H5>  Please Open the Door of One's Mind </H5>
  Most Chinese intellectuals gave up the right to independent 
thinking of their own accord. Many scholars regressed into 
juvenile or infantile thinking. Because of their intellectual 
sloppiness, they became either wolf-like or sheep-like. 
Intellectuals were completely stripped of their independent 
personality. In addition, a succession of political movements 
objectively drove home the grim fact that other than Mao Zedong, 
it was harmful and downright dangerous for anybody else to even 
think. No matter how senior their positions, however solid their 
credentials, they would all come to grief (Real-life examples 
include Liu Shaoqi [0491 1421 1142] and Peng Dehuai [1756 1795 
2037]). 
  There was a time when people of the Mao Zedong era 
congratulated themselves on the existence of Mao Zedong. Later 
they rejoiced over his passing from the scene. No leader, 
however great, can guarantee a nation's stable sustained 
development. What is needed is a political system that entrusts 
hope, democracy, and freedom to the people and where the people 
can effectively supervise and replace public servants, including 
the No. 1 public servant. 
  Another century. With countless centuries behind it, one 
more 
century, one less century does not mean anything to China. For a 
generation or two, however, a century covers its entire 
life-span. 
  Today, at long last, China has changed its course and headed 
toward the world. China must shed its isolation, poverty, and 
degeneration. But it must never again long for the birth of 
another great helmsman. For starters, everybody must unlock the 
door to his thinking, something that requires courage and 
strength because for too long he has been held prisoner 
ideologically. Then every door in China must be opened to let in 
fresh air. One door, however, must not be opened, namely the 
heavy door leading to the imperial throne. 
  (Bai Hua is a Shanghai writer. His screenplay "Bitter Love" 
came under attack in 1981.)

<LEADPARA>  Archaeologists have unearthed Egypt's oldest bakery, where bakers laboring in
smoke-filled rooms turned out thousands of loaves every day for hungry
pyramid-builders.;   "We're talking colossal baking here, easily enough to
feed 30,000 people a day," said Egyptologist Mark Lehner of the University of
Chicago's Oriental Institute.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER RUINS OF COLOSSAL BAKERY
THAT FED PYRAMID BUILDERS
DISCOVERY ILLUMINATES LIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The well-preserved bakery, with a hearth, dough vats and bread pots, dates
from Giza Plateau's pyramid-building days, which began with the fourth dynasty
in 2575 B.C. Experts say it's the oldest bakery found in Egypt, perhaps in the
world.;   To ancient Egyptians, king or commoner, bread was an everyday
staple, taken with a bit of onion or garlic and a swig of beer. Money didn't
exist, and bread was doled out as partial payment to those who inched massive
stones into the towering pyramids that still evoke awe after 4,600 years.;  
14 kinds of bread; Records from the period describe at least 14 kinds of
bread. So far the team of American and Egyptian Egyptologists working 1 1/2
miles from the Sphinx has found three kinds of bread molds: small and large
bell-shaped, and flat trays. The largest earthenware molds weigh 22 pounds.;  
The dig began in October, financed by business executives David Koch of New
York and Bruce Ludwig of Los Angeles. Diggers found the bakery in November.
After the season's work ends this month, team members plan to study the art of
bread-making using ingredients available then.;   "I have to admit I'm not a
baking expert, which would help," said Lehner, the excavation's co-director.
He said tomb artists left some baking clues, though much was left to the
imagination.;   Bread-baking is pictured on tomb walls of a fifth-dynasty
official named Ty in the cemetery of Sakkara south of the pyramids.;   "We
didn't know for sure until now that this scene was real. We didn't have a
bakery to compare it with," said expedition co-director Zahi Hawass, in charge
of antiquities in the pyramids-Sakkara area.;   Baked in clay pots; A room in
the bakery contains three large earthenware vats beside rows of grooves for
bread pots lined up like eggs in a carton.;   The excavation has revealed
generally how bakers did their work. They took a "bedja," a heated, greased
bread pot, and put the rounded end into a baking pit. They poured in the dough
and placed an inverted pot on top. Both pots were covered with heated coals
and ash, causing the dough to rise and bake.;   For those making the bread,
working conditions were nightmarish.;   Heat was intense. Smoke was so thick
"these rooms would have been like a night sky filled with rain," Lehner said.
"We've dug through 1 1/2 feet of black-velvet, built-up ash."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   In the Tang Dynasty 1,000 years ago,
boatmen carried rice and supplies to fight the northern barbarians.
Today, boatmen on barges still pass through Huaian, but now they
carry coal and bricks to keep China's great metropolises humming.
   Life goes on, changing but always the same along the world's
longest man-made waterway, the 1,000-mile Grand Canal, which Hua
Yuhua, a local official, describes ``as great a feat as the Great
Wall.''
   In Huaian, a 1,600-year-old town in coastal Jiangsu province,
the canal remains the lifeline.
   Huaian is a bumpy, four-hour drive from the provincial capital
of Nanjing and has no railway.
   ``We have looked to the water in developing our land,'' said the
local radio station director, Wang Ruoyuan.
   Every day about 1,200 barges, some in convoys of as many as 10,
pass through the town's two locks, where they are lowered or raised
about 10 feet.
   Along the shore, a sea of men in green and blue jackets load and
unload the coal, grain, vegetables, oil, roof tile, cotton, lumber
and gravel that traverse the 220-mile Jiangsu stretch from the
Yangtze River in the south to the city of Xuzhou in the north.
   The lucky ones have donkeys, but for most a strong back and
sturdy shoulders are crucial. People strapped to harnesses tug at
carts and wagons. On one bridge, a unique pulley system helps them
up an incline.
   Bicycles weave around bridge-side stalls that sell cabbage,
oranges, soft drinks and sugar cane. Children gather around to
watch an elderly couple puff oats with a hand bellows that fires a
blackened iron pressure vessel.
   Fishermen come by with cormorants perched on bicycle handlebars,
taking the black seabirds to catch fish for them.
   Work on the canal began in the 6th century B.C. But the early
7th century Emperor Yangdi built the main sections, from the
western capital of Luoyang eastward and the north-south channel
linking Hangzhou to Beijing, China's modern-day capital.
   Hundreds of thousands are believed to have been mobilized for
the project.
   Upon its completion, the emperor sailed its length at the head
of a flotilla extending in close file for 60 miles.
   During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), what served as the ministry
of transport was in Huaian, and the city had a population of
200,000, double its current number, town official Hua said.
   The canal fell into disrepair after the Tang Dynasty, but the
Kublai Khan rebuilt it in the 13th century.
   The Communist government, after coming to power in 1949, has
built an extensive irrigation and flood control system to make life
easier for the people of this waterlogged, impoverished area.
   The town fathers also hope Huaian's rich historical heritage
will draw tourists. It was the home to Han Xin, the Han dynasty
(206 B.C.-220 A.D.) general; Wu Chengen, writer of ``Journey to the
West,'' the classic of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and the late
Premier Chou En-lai.
   One small temple along the canal has a statue in memory of the
``washerwoman,'' an upright woman who helped Gen. Han when he was a
poor boy and later refused a reward of 1,000 taels of silver.
   Near that temple, outside their one-room brick homes with
upswept tile roofs, the washerwomen of today are still down at the
canal, hard at work.

<HEAD>Saddam Invokes Iraq's Ancient Glory To Become New Nebuchadnezzar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein is invoking the cultural
glories of Iraq's ancient empires and their legendary warrior-kings
like Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon to enhance his claim to be the
new champion of the Arab world.
   The Iraqi president has rewritten history books and purports to
be a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, who founded Islam in the
6th century. He has employed more than 1,000 workers and spent
millions to rebuild Babylon, capital of Nebuchadnezzar's empire.
   Saddam seeks to rally support among the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems and legitimize his crusade against the West and
Israel in their eyes as he finds himself facing a U.S.-led
international quarantine for invading Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Saddam's evocation of Iraq's ancient dynasties has given rise to
suspicions among other Arabs that he harbors imperial ambitions.
   Nebuchadnezzar's empire embraced Kuwait, now gobbled up by Iraq,
and what are now Syria, Jordan, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
   Saddam, 54, has been shrouding himself in the mythology of
Iraq's historical heyday from the 6th century B.C. to the 8th
century to consolidate his power.
   Around this he has created an all-pervasive personality cult.
Huge posters and wall paintings of Saddam in noble pose are
ever-present, as are photos of him on front pages of Iraqi
newspapers.
   A plaque in the Shiite Moslem mosque of Imam Hussein in the holy
city of Karbala in southern Iraq shows a family tree that
supposedly proves that the former peasant boy can trace his lineage
back to Mohammed through the Hashemite kings of Arabia.
   The Information Ministry in Baghdad freely hands out copies,
although the accuracy of the family tree cannot be authenticated
and many non-Iraqi Arabs are highly skeptical of its provenance.
   But to help it along, Saddam has in the last couple of years
rehabilitated the once discredited Hashemite monarchy of Iraq,
overthrown in a 1958 coup and denounced as a British puppet regime.
   Iraqis like to point out that ancient Mesopotamia, in
present-day Iraq, is generally viewed as the cradle of
civilization. Mesopotamis means ``the land between the rivers'' _
the Euphrates and the Tigris.
   Archaeological excavations have produced evidence of settlements
dating from 7,000 B.C. The Garden of Eden is reputed to have been
at Al-Qurna, where the Euphrates and Tigris join.
   Saddam's most ambitious effort to project himself as the new
Nebuchadnezzar has been the resurrection of Babylon, the jewel of
Mesopotamian civilization.
   Saddam began rebuilding Babylon four years ago during the
1980-88 war with Iran. He brought in more than 1,000 laborers from
Sudan to toil in the desert heat on the banks of the Euphrates to
rebuild Nebuchadnezzar's Southern Palace and other parts of the
ruined city, 60 miles north of Baghdad.
   By encouraging Iraqis to steep themselves in the glories of
Babylon, and those of the great Mesopotamian cultures that
flourished around the cities of Nineveh, Nimrud and Ur, Saddam
sought to boost national morale as well as enhance his own dynastic
credentials.
   Nebuchadnezzar was tailor-made for Saddam's grandiose crusade to
portray himself as the savior of the Arabs against Israel.
   The Baylonian king sacked Jerusalem. He took the Children of
Israel into captivity for 50 years and fought for years with the
Persians, ancient enemies of the Arabs.
   Iraqi officials conveniently ignore, however, that the
Achaemenian Persians conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.
   Iraqi history books now refer to Nebuchadnezzar as the defender
of ``the Arab nation,'' even though he lived 1,000 years before
there was such a thing.
   Rebuilding Babylon has cost Iraq millions of dollars while the
country is saddled with a war debt estimated from $50 billion to
$60 billion.
   That does not include the $10 billion owed to Kuwait which the
puppet government Saddam installed there conveniently wrote off.
   Saddam has not restricted himself to identifying with
Nebuchadnezzar. He has likened himself to Hammurabi, who ruled
Babylon in the 17th century B.C. and is credited with drawing up
the world's first written code of law and with razing the cities of
his enemies.
   Mesopotamia was the center of the Parthian empire which emerged
in the 2nd century B.C. and lasted for 400 years. Its capital was
Ctesiphon, whose ruins lie near modern Baghdad.
   The Parthians came later and held back the Romans and the
Byzantine empire until A.D. 637, when they were conquered by the
Arabs sweeping out of the south to spread the new religion of Islam
by the sword.
   In 750, the Abbasids, whose capital was Baghdad, carved out an
Islamic empire stretching from what is now Pakistan to Morocco.
   This was the era of Caliph Haroun al-Rashid, when Baghdad
flowered as the center of Arabic culture and the beguiling city of
the Thousand and One Nights.

<TEXT>
   Sketches of some of the places that President Bush will be
visiting during his trip to three Asian capitals, beginning today:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TOKYO</NOTE>
<NOTE>The Okura Hotel</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush will spend two nights in the hotel, most likely in the
Imperial Suite used by then President Reagan during the 1986
economic summit. The hilltop site of the 27-year-old hotel was owned
by the noble Okura family, which had run one of the big pre-war
industrial combines called zaibatsu.
   The 888-room hotel, across the street from the U.S. Embassy and
ambassador's residence, just finished a three-year refurbishment
last September. The management says the U.S. delegation is taking
about 400 of the Okura's rooms, and 13 other foreign delegations to
the funeral of Emperor Hirohito also will be housed there.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Akasaka Palace</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The palace, where Hirohito spent part of his young manhood and
early married life before he ascended the throne in 1926, was
completed in 1909 to be the crown prince's residence, and was such a
grand building that the Meiji Emperor (1868-1912) was said to be
unwilling to visit it.
   Modeled on the palace at Versailles and the Louvre, Akasaka
Palace is a grand example of architecture in the late Meiji period
when Japan, then emerging in a rush from feudal isolation, was
trying to outdo the West. Most of the building materials and
furnishings were imported.
   The palace, which sits in its own large park, was restored in the
1970s and now is used as a guesthouse for foreign dignitaries and to
hold major conferences, such as the 1986 economic summit. Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita will host a reception there following the
Hirohito funeral.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Imperial Palace</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The main ceremonial building within the moated, 284-acre palace
grounds in the center of Tokyo, the Imperial Palace was built in
1968 to replace a structure lost in a World War II firestorm caused
by U.S. bombing.
   The palace grounds include ponds, moats and forests as well as
administrative buildings and the Fukiage Mansion where Hirohito
lived through his final illness.
   The moats, walls and some structures date from the 17th century,
when the whole complex was called Edo Castle, the fortified
headquarters of the Tokugawa Shogunate that then ruled Japan from
Edo, the old name of Tokyo.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Shinjuku Imperial Gardens</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The site of the Hirohito funeral services, the park once served
as the garden for the imperial household. In mid-April, it becomes
one of the favorite places in Tokyo for people to picnic under what
seem to be clouds of cherry blossoms.
   A sanctuary has been constructed for the funeral, as well as two
tents 482 feet long to shelter 10,000 Japanese and foreign
dignitaries from the February weather.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>BEIJING</NOTE>
<NOTE>Great Hall</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   This cavernous, Soviet-style hall of beige-colored stone was
built in less than a year for the celebration of the communist
government's 10-year anniversary in 1959. It sits on the west side
of Beijing's broad Tienanmen Square in the traditional heart of the
city, and is the site for all major gatherings, including Communist
Party conferences and legislative sessions.
   Bush, like other state visitors, will come here for his official
red-carpet greeting, including cannon volleys and gifts of flowers
from small children who jump up and down and shout in sing-song,
``Warm welcome.''
   The president also will be toasted by China's top leaders at a
Great Hall banquet. The central banquet hall, with a two-story-high
ceiling, can sit 5,000 people and often does. But it is a long way
from the basement kitchen, and food often arrives cold.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Zhongnanhai</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Meaning ``the Central and South Seas,'' Zhongnanhai is a 213-acre
compound embracing two large lakes that used to be part of the
imperial palace grounds. It now serves as Communist Party
headquarters, and many visiting leaders, including Bush, are taken
behind its well-guarded vermillion walls to meet with party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   In the past, many top leaders also lived in Zhongnanhai, although
the current leaders are believed to live most of the time in their
own homes. A small portion of Zhongnanhai is open to Chinese
tourists as a park, but remains closed to foreigners.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Chongwenmen Christian Church</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush is expected to attend services at this Protestant church
hidden behind high stone walls along a narrow hutong, or alley. The
stone church built by missionaries with a round, dark-wood vaulted
ceiling usually is filled to capacity on Sundays with about 1,500
people, making it one of the largest of Beijing's six Protestant
churches.
   It was being used as a factory when Bush lived in Beijing as the
U.S. envoy. Like all other churches and temples, its religous
functions were halted during the radical leftist Cultural Revolution
of 1966-76, when religion was banned. It reopened as a church in
1983.
   During the ban on religion, however, the pastor, the Rev. Kan
Xueqing, was ordered by the government to hold Sunday services for
the small foreign community. The Bushes attended, and in 1975 Kan
baptized their daughter, Dorothy, then 16.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Diaoyutai State Guesthouse</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese antiques, a king-sized bed, gold-plated plumbing and an
electric massage chair are among the accommodations awaiting Bush in
this elegant, high-security government hotel.
   Diaoyutai, ``the fishing terrace'' covering 100 acres of park,
served as a retreat for emperors more than 800 years ago. The
communist government built guest villas there in 1959 to accommodate
the many foreign leaders visiting on the 10th anniversary of the
communist takeover.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA</NOTE>
<NOTE>The Blue House</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The house and its auxiliary facilities have been used as the
nation's presidential residence since the first Republic of Korea
was formed in 1948, and is now the home of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Built in 1927 by Japanese colonial rulers, the big two-story
granite structure derives its name from its tiled roofs, which are
painted blue. It is on a mountainside north of the city center, near
the remaining royal palaces of the Chosun Dynasty kings, who ruled
Korea for five centuries. The U.S. military administration used the
Blue House as its headquarters for three years after Korea was
divided in 1945.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The National Assembly</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly building, home of South Korea's unicameral
legislative body, is a domed six-story structure surrounded by
granite columns said to symbolize the harmony of diverse opinions of
the Korean people.
   The assembly building was constructed in 1975 on an island in the
Han River, which runs through the capital city. Bush made a speech
at the National Assembly during his visit in April 1982 as vice
president.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Yongsan garrison</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The garrison is headquarters for the Combined Forces Command, the
U.S. Forces Korea, the U.S. 8th Army and the United Nations Command,
and serves as operational control center for the 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   Located on 714 acres south of central Seoul, the garrison was
used as the Japanese Imperial Army headquarters until after World
War II. It has 20.4 miles of paved roads, 1,225 buildings and homes
for more than 6,000 families and military personnel. There are
stores, theaters, schools, a hospital, fire station and power plants
_ a city within a city.

CHINA'S QUEST FOR CHINA; 
</P>
<P>
THE SEARCH FOR MODERN CHINA BY JONATHAN D. SPENCE (W.W. NORTON: $29.95; 876 
PP.,ILLUSTRATED; 0-393-02708-2)

<BYLINE>
<P>
By Frank Ching, Ching, former China correspondent of The Wall Street Journal, 
is the author of Ancestors: 900 Years in the Life of a Chinese Family (William 
Morrow). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1759, Li Syiyao, the viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi, submitted to the 
Qianlong emperor a draft of "Regulations for the Control of Foreigners." In the 
memorial, the viceroy expressed amazement and horror at the fact that some 
foreigners had been able to learn to speak and write Chinese, while one of them 
could understand not just Mandarin but also the Cantonese dialect. 
</P>
<P>
"How could these foreigners have learned Chinese if they had not been taught 
secretly by traitors?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The viceroy continued: "It is my most humble opinion that when uncultured 
barbarians, who live far beyond the borders of China, come to our country to 
trade, they should establish no contact with the population, except for 
business purposes." 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Empire in those days went to great lengths to keep even its 
language a secret from foreigners. When an English merchant, James Flint, 
presented a petition levying charges against the superintendent of customs, the 
emperor, after verifying the allegations, dismissed the official, sentenced 
Flint to three years of exile in Macao for having violated protocol, and had 
the Sichuanese who helped him prepare the Chinese-language petition publicly 
beheaded. 
</P>
<P>
This obsession with secrecy, this passion to prevent foreigners from finding 
out what China is really like, accounts to some extent for the myths and 
mystique surrounding China. Even Deng Xiaoping has said that one has to go back 
to the Ming Dynasty, to the time when the 15th-Century explorer Zheng He went 
on expeditions to the western oceans, to discover a time when China did not 
practice a closed-door policy. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan D. Spence in "The Search for Modern China" endeavors to facilitate an 
understanding of China. He says, quite rightly, that "in trying to understand 
China today we need to know about China in the past." That is why Spence begins 
his narrative in the late 16th Century, when China was ruled by its last native 
dynasty on the eve of the Manchu conquest. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the Yale historian explains that his book is not about modern 
China. Rather, it is about a centuries-long effort to create such a country, 
one which "is both integrated and receptive, fairly sure of its own identity, 
yet able to join others on equal terms in the quest for new markets, new 
technologies, new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
By this definition, Spence says, China is not today and never has been a modern 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, China in the Qing Dynasty was far from being "fairly sure of its own 
identity, yet able to join others on equal terms." As Spence points out, China 
did not even have a national flag in its 4,000 years of existence, until one 
was created in the 19th Century, when the country consciously began to acquire 
what it thought were the attributes of a modern nation. 
</P>
<P>
As is to be expected, Spence finds numerous parallels in Chinese history. Thus 
he likens Gen. Claire Chennault's World War II "Flying Tigers" to the foreign 
mercenary Ever-Victorious Army formed to fight the Taiping rebels; he sees 
similarities between Great Leap Forward rhetoric and the vision of Hong 
Xiuquan, the Taiping Heavenly King, and he compares the Shanghai Communique of 
1972 with the Treaty of Nerchinsk of 1689. 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean, of course, that China is unchanging. During the Qing 
Dynasty, for example, China spurned British requests to develop trade. Spence 
quotes the Qianlong emperor's message to George III of England: 
</P>
<P>
"We have never valued ingenious articles, nor do we have the slightest need of 
your country's manufactures. Therefore, O king, as regards your request to send 
someone to remain at the capital, while it is not in harmony with the 
regulations of the Celestial Empire, we also feel very much that it is of no 
advantage to your country." 
</P>
<P>
This disdain for trade has now been replaced by eagerness to earn foreign 
exchange. Recently, we saw China go to great lengths in its attempt to retain 
most-favored-nation trading status with the United States. In the weeks before 
Washington was to decide whether to renew China's trading privileges, Beijing 
went so far as to lift martial law in Tibet and to release hundreds of 
political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Spence has an eye for the telling detail, the little twists of fate that propel 
history forward. Thus he says that when two Soviet nuclear experts were 
withdrawn from China during the Sino-Soviet dispute, they tore to shreds all 
the documents they could not take with them. But the Chinese painstakingly 
reconstructed the shredded documents and "found in them crucial information on 
atomic implosion." 
</P>
<P>
This is by no means a book that can be read in one sitting. Some of Spence's 
earlier books were page-turners: "The Death of Woman Wang" was as gripping as 
any thriller; "Emperor of China: Self-Portrait of K'ang-hsi" was poignant and 
stirred one's deepest emotions. 
</P>
<P>
But "The Search for Modern China" is the most ambitious work by the author thus 
far. It is encyclopedic in scope. It is crammed with facts, dates and names. 
Its 876 pages include 49 well placed maps and 49 well chosen tables, as well as 
dozens of illustrations in color and black-and-white. Its contents are to be 
sipped and savored, not swallowed in big gulps. 
</P>
<P>
Spence, the master historian, is on less sure ground when dealing with more 
recent events. Thus he has Chiang Ching-kuo becoming president of Taiwan in 
1975, three years too early. He also displays an uncertain grasp of his facts 
regarding the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
But these petty details are almost not worth mentioning when one considers the 
scale of the task that he set himself. "The Search for Modern China" is a 
landmark in China scholarship. Spence's talent as a raconteur and his immensely 
readable style enable him to succeed in making history interesting to the 
nonspecialist. 
</P>
<P>
On the present succession crisis in China, Spence points out the eerie parallel 
between Deng Xiaoping's behavior today and that of Mao Zedong in his last 
years, with each man anointing, then purging, one hand-picked successor after 
another. Even greater perspective is provided by his relating the present 
situation to that of the early Qing Dynasty, when the Emperor Kangxi was 
brought, as Spence put it, "to the edge of despair" by the succession question, 
not being able to decide which of his many sons to name as his heir. 
</P>
<P>
The author provides a rare perspective on China's centuries-old struggle to 
come to terms with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls that the reformers of 1898 had sought to resolve this tension by 
developing the concept of ti, or "essence," and yong, or "practical use." This 
formulation, Spence says, "affirmed that there was indeed a fundamental 
structure of Chinese moral and philosophical values that gave continuity and 
meaning to the civilization. Holding onto that belief, China could then afford 
to adopt quickly and dramatically all sorts of Western practices, and to hire 
Western advisers." 
</P>
<P>
Spence sees Deng and the other Chinese leaders today falling victim "to the 
nineteenth-century fallacy that China could join the modern world entirely on 
its own terms, sacrificing nothing of its prevailing ideological purity." 
</P>
<P>
He feels this effort is doomed to failure. "The task was even more hopeless in 
the late 1980s than it had been in the 1880s," Spence concludes. "What was left 
of Chinese communist doctrine after the rejection of many of Mao's ideas and 
the emergence of the enterprise system was a thinner gruel even than the 
overformalized Confucianism that had guided the reformers of the late Qing. The 
party elders flailing out at Zhao Ziyang and his noisy supporters were reacting 
in an oddly similar way to the empress dowager Cixi as she struck back at 
Emperor Guangxu for attempting his Hundred Days' Reforms." 
</P>
<P>
As Spence and other students of history are well aware, circumstances in later 
years forced the empress dowager to implement even more radical reform measures 
than the ones that her nephew the emperor tried to put in place. But those came 
too late to save the dynasty.

FT  11 JUL 94 / Kim Il-sung: war hero, skilled politician and tyrant: A look
at the career of the 'Great Leader' who exploited North Koreans' xenophobia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The death of 82-year-old North Korean President Kim Il-sung ends the longest
rule of any political leader in the 20th century. His durability was based
not only on the brute force of the authoritarian regime that he created, but
also reflected his consummate political skills.
Mr Kim's strength rested on his ability to appeal to Korea's strong national
pride and his rule was deeply-rooted in Korean tradition. His policy of
juche (self-reliance), which gradually replaced Communism as North Korea's
main ideology, was based on Korean resentment against centuries of foreign
intervention.
In his 46 years as leader, he manipulated Confucian principles of filial
piety to promote his own role as Great Leader and to establish a dynastic
succession for his son, Mr Kim Jong-il.
But Mr Kim's passing is likely to prove it was the power of his personality,
bolstered by mass adoration expressed in semi-religious public ceremonies,
that was the glue that held North Korea together.
His absence will expose more clearly the faults of his policy of xenophobic
nationalism, which carries with it the seeds of North Korea's own
destruction. His efforts to create a self-sufficient Korea have taken a
heavy toll on the economy, apparently heading toward collapse.
Mr Kim's nationalist attitudes were formed in his youth under Japanese
colonial rule. He was born as Kim Song-ju on April 15, 1912, two years after
Korea was annexed by Japan. His family moved when he was seven from his
birthplace near Pyongyang to Manchuria, northern China, where he became
involved in Communist organisations in his late teens.
Mr Kim became a genuine hero of the Korean independence movement, commanding
units ranging from a handful of soldiers to 300-man forces within Manchuria
and along the Korean border. But by 1941, Japanese military pressure forced
him to withdraw to the Soviet far east.
He used his Soviet military contacts to gain a leadership position in North
Korea Communist party by December 1945 and two months later was chairman of
the North Korean provisional government.
Mr Kim introduced popular measures in late 1940s including land reform and
nationalisation of the mostly Japanese-owned industry. He become the prime
minister of North Korea when the country was officially established in
September 1948 and chairman of the ruling Korean Workers' Party a year
later, securing a dominant political position.
His main goal was then to reunite North and South Korea. He deftly played
off the Soviet Union against China to gain the support of both for an
invasion of the South. The gamble seemed reasonable, as the southern
military was weak and ill-equipped, while the US had indicated it would not
come to Seoul's defence.
But the gamble failed disasterously after the US decided to intervene in its
first main armed confrontation with the Communist bloc.
With the end of the Korean war in 1953, Mr Kim embarked on a Stalinist
policy of forced agricultural collectivisation and creation of heavy
industry. The programme relied heavily on Soviet economic aid, including
supply of plant facilities and machinery, but it initially provided the
North with faster growth than the South.
A critical turning point came with the Sino-Soviet split in 1961 and the
Soviet retreat in the Cuban missile crisis a year later. Both events
convinced Mr Kim he could not rely on either Beijing or Moscow for his and
North Korea's survival.
He began constructing a fortress state that would increasingly divert
massive resources from the rest of the economy. He built a domestic arms
industry and created one of the largest armies in the world. It was during
this period that North Korea laid the foundation for a nuclear weapons
programme that would fruition almost 30 years later.
By the early 1970s, North Korea was losing its economic race with the South,
which had embarked on its own military-led industrialisation programme in
the early 1960s. Pyongyang made one last effort to import western technology
to replace outdated Soviet and Chinese machinery, but subsequently defaulted
on international bank loans used to buy the equipment.
This was accompanied by political repression, with an estimated 100,000
persons being placed in prison camps. North Korean terrorist activities also
multiplied.
But in the late 1980s, North Korea began tentative moves to open itself to
the outside world. in 1990 it joined the UN and the prime ministers of the
two Koreas began meeting regularly. Progress was capped by the signing of
non-aggression and non-nuclear pacts with the South in late 1991.
The North's gradual opening was forced by the collapse of Soviet bloc, which
deprived Pyongyang of important export markets and source of vital oil and
food imports. The economy began shrinking at an annual rate of 5 per cent
after 1989.
North Korea's threat last year to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation
was regarded as an attempt to win Western concessions and Mr Kim appeared to
be achieving his goal of gaining US support when he died.

   China will begin a tour next month that will
follow the life of Pu Yi, the tragic figure who was the subject of
Bernardo Bertolucci's award-winning film ``The Last Emperor,'' it
was reported Thursday.
   The tour will take foreigners to his birthplace and childhood
home in the Forbidden City, the house in Tianjin where he lived in
exile and the prison in Changchun, northeast China, where he was
held after 1949 Communist takeover, according to the official
Xinhua news agency.
   Lu Bin, deputy head of the Beijing Tourism Administration, said
banquets will be served in Qing Dynasty settings with imperial
music and dances.
   Pu Yi's belongings, paintings, calligraphy and the manuscript of
his autobiography, ``From Emperor to Citizen'' will be on display
along the route, it said.
   The report did not say how much the tour would cost.
   Pu Yi, born in 1906, was emperor from 1908 to the overthrow of
the 267-year Qing Dynasty in 1911. He continued to live in the
Imperial Palace, or Forbidden City, until 1924. In 1932 he became
emperor of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in northeast
China.
   He was imprisoned by the Soviets and then the Chinese after
World War II, and was finally released in 1959 to work as a
gardener. He died in 1967.
   Bertolucci's film won nine Academy Awards this year and has been
shown in more than 20 countries. The Chinese premiere of the movie
is scheduled for September after a delay reportedly resulting from
official unhappiness over the way the movie treats some events.

<HL> The Price Is Wrong, Connoisseurs Decide At Chinese Auction --- Most Antiques Go Begging As New Market in Beijing Conducts Its First Big Sale </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> FREST </CO>
<DATELINE> BEIJING (AP)  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beijing's first large-scale auction of antiques ended Friday with overpriced items going once, going twice and gone back to the warehouse. 

   Of 33 antiques valued at $270,000, only three of the cheapest items, bought by a Japanese businessman and his friends for $2,168, were bid on. 

   "We'd buy if the prices were reasonable," said a Hong Kong businessman who left before the show ended. 
"But the prices are way too high. 
They don't know how to auction. 
They're starting far too high." 

   More than 400 people, including about 40 foreigners, attended the auction sponsored by the Beijing Auction Market, a state-run organization obtaining most of its goods from antique stores. 

   The auction market made its debut last month with a little-publicized sale of less expensive items that fetched $27,400. 

   Friday's auction, which the sponsors said was the capital's first large-scale official sale of antiques, attracted more attention, bringing in diplomats, foreign businessmen and their spouses looking for bargains. 

   The only bargain was the entry fee, a modest $2.70. 

   Many of the most expensive items were antique copies of older pieces, such as a 17th-century reproduction of a Sung Dynasty (960-1126) scroll that had a starting bid price of $81,000. 

   An original 19th-century scroll with a starting price of $27,000 was ignored by bidders, as were several vases and bowls going for $8,100 and up. 

   The Japanese businessman finally broke the no-bid ice on the 17th item when he paid $622 for the cheapest item on the list, a pottery figure dating back to the Sui Dynasty (581-618). 

   "I thought it was worth it because it is so old," he said. 
"Most of the things here are too expensive." 

   The businessman and his companions also purchased a Sung Dynasty bowl for $868 and a Tang Dynasty (618-906) bronze mirror for $678. 

   Most of the Chinese in the audience were reporters and their friends. 
The average Chinese worker earns a little more than $270 a year, and all purchases had to be paid for in foreign-exchange certificates, a currency used for foreign transactions. 
Few Chinese have access to these certificates. 

   The Beijing Auction Market is the fifth to open in China. 
The official media has praised the markets as another means to speed up the circulation of goods and promote a market-based economy.

<TEXT>
   Workmen cleaning a heavily traveled tourist
area of a fabled temple stumbled across an ancient hoard of statues
of pharaohs and gods, a discovery that researchers called a
potential gold mine of historical data.
   Officials said five statutes so far have been dug up inside the
famous Luxor Temple in Luxor, a Nile River city about 450 miles
south of Cairo.
   ``There are other statues still buried, and only small parts of
them are showing,'' Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization. ``We will know more when we dig them up.''
   He said he expects the statues to represent leaders and deities
from a 750-year period that ended about 500 B.C., shortly before the
Persians conquered Egypt.
   Displaying the find to President Hosni Mubarak on Friday,
Egyptologist Aly Hassan described it as ``the most important of the
end of the 20th century.''
   Notable from the first half of the century are the discovery of
the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun across the Nile River from Luxor in
1922; a fabulous golden trove found in the Nile Delta at Tanis in
1939; and a dismantled full-size boat found beside the
4,600-year-old pyriamid of Pharaoh Cheops in 1954.
   Hassan said the Luxor Temple discovery turned up by chance on
Jan. 22 during routine cleaning of an area at the western end of the
temple's Amenhophis III courtyard, rimmed by towering and majestic
columns.
   Three of the five statues found so far have been identified, he
said.
   One is an 8-foot quartzite statue of Pharaoh Amenhophis III, who
ruled Egypt in 1391-1353 B.C. and founded the existing Luxor Temple.
The others are life-sized or larger.
   Another statue, 5{-feet long and made of black diorite, depicts
the cow-headed goddess Hathor, guardian of women, beauty and love.
The third identified statue, made of granite, is of General
Haremhab, a soldier who usurped the Egyptian throne at the end of
the 18th dynasty after Tutankhamun and his caretaker Aya died.
   He said the Amenhophis III statue became visible as workers were
cleaning.
   ``Nobody expected such a find because the area is visited by so
many tourists each day,'' Hassan said.
   Until Friday, the cache remained covered and under guard.
Antiquities officials debated whether excavating the relics would
damage the fragile temple and jeopardize the stability of columns.
   Luxor Temple, an island of stone beauty beside the Nile, is
considered the most endangered monument in the Luxor area,
undermined by a rising water table and a river of sewage water
flowing beneath it.
   During its construction, the temple underwent continual changes
and additions, including changes ordered by Tutankhamun, Ramses II
and Alexander the Great.
   After the reign of Amenhophis III, ancient Egypt's religion
underwent major upheaval when his son and successor Akhenaten
ordered that a new god, Aten, be given precedence over the existing
array of deities. His agents hacked the name of Amun, the
long-favored god of Thebes, from monuments throughout Egypt.
   The new discoveries give evidence of the turbulence, as the name
Amun was chiseled from Amenhophis's statue. Egyptian officials said
the cache surely will yield historical data from the period of
religious frenzy and violence.
   Antiquities officials said the statues probably were hidden by
temple priests.
   ``We can expect to find such caches from time to time,'' said
Zahi Hawass, archaeological adviser to the culture minister and
director of Giza Plateau. ``We think these objects were buried by
priests trying to hide them during periods when strife was occurring
throughout the country.''

<TEXT>
   On a brisk fall weekend, thousands of people
streamed up a stone stairway to a 350-year-old tomb honoring the
man who, far more than microchips or management systems, created
modern Japan.
   The tomb of Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa and a gold-encrusted shrine
sit in a forest 70 miles northeast of Tokyo. The shogun was
promoted in death from man to god and is known as Gongen-sama,
``Protector of the Realm.''
   For many visitors, the journey may be just an opportunity to
view the autumn foliage, but another impulse sends even retired
people and young couples with toddlers up the 530-foot stairway.
   ``Wherever you go in Japan, there's evidence of the Tokugawa
era, so a lot of people are curious to see this place,'' said
Tsuchiyasu Kiyomitsu, a 30-year-old businessman who rested as other
visitors rang a long-corded bell and paid obeisance.
   The big-bellied shogun was a warlord of legendary willpower who
completed the unification of Japan in 1600 and virtually cut it off
from the world.
   Japan's isolation lasted 268 years, and the family dynasty he
founded deified Tokugawa after his death to help legitimize itself.
   During the long period of isolation, Japan created its own brand
of capitalism, including the world's first futures market (in
rice). It also refined the group behavior that still distinguishes
Japanese society, scholars say.
   Under the Tokugawas, Japan began evolving the paternalistic,
protected-market economy that has confounded policy makers in
Washington, inspired Japan-bashing around the world and helped make
the small archipelago very rich.
   Not surprisingly for Japan, where families routinely trace their
ancestry back for centuries, the Tokugawa legacy exists in the
flesh as well as in folklore.
   Had the dynasty not been overthrown in 1868, the man who might
be shogun today is Tsunenari Tokugawa, 50, current head of the
family. He manages North American operations for Nippon Yusen, a
Tokyo-based shipping company.
   ``Basically, everything that you call Japanese, our weaknesses
and our strong points, many of them in a sense matured in this
260-year period,'' he told an interviewer in his Tokyo office.
   ``Maybe we matured too strongly,'' he added with a smile,
referring to international criticism of Japan's economic practices.
   Tsunenari Tokugawa, a child of postwar egalitarian Japan, gave
an embarrassed laugh about his aristocratic lineage and pointed out
that he goes to work every day like any other ``salaryman.''
   The executive, whose wide eyes and broad face resemble portraits
of Ieyasu Tokugawa, acknowledged that he and other scions of old
feudal families often discuss the imprint his ancestors made.
   ``Whether we like it or not, we are still living under the long
line of Tokugawa influence,'' he said. ``That includes many, many,
many things: the way we think, the way we form teamwork, our system
of education.''
   Perhaps the most enduring legacy developed from a clever method
Ieyasu Tokugawa and his descendants used to stay in power, scholars
say. They kept the feudal domains they controlled off balance by
forcing each daimyo, or lord, to spend half the year in Tokyo.
   This created a nationwide capital network, since money had to
move in and out of Tokyo to support the pilgrimages.
   Fierce competition arose between domain governments and group
allegiance developed within them. The competition led each domain
to promote industry and agriculture, in part to pay for the
expensive journeys.
   ``The domain governments were strongly paternalistic,'' wrote
Marius Jansen, a Princeton University expert on Tokugawa Japan.
   ``They instituted monopolies in whatever was profitable for
export (to other domains). It is no accident that one of the great
modern firms, that of Mitsubishi, had its origins in such an
administrative arrangement.''
   Friends and colleagues tease Tsunenari Tokugawa about the
``shogun business'' he must attend to. On each anniversary of
Ieyasu's death, he goes to the Nikko shrine and dons the
traditional court costume.
   This year, the government called upon him to help celebrate the
400th anniversary of Tokyo, the city Ieyasu founded and made the
capital of Japan.
   Every March 1, Tokyo fishermen practice one of the more obscure
traditions binding Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa to modern Japan. They
deliver a load of fresh whitebait to Tsunenari's home as
compensation for the fishing rights his ancestors granted theirs.
   ``These things are not really for the Tokugawa family,''
Tsunenari Tokugawa said. ``In a sense, it's in order for them to
prove their identity.''

   The first exhibition to probe the artistic
dialogue between Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque during the years
they collaborated on Cubism has opened at the Museum of Modern Art.
   It is perhaps the most important art event of the season, for
Cubism was possibly a vision that could only have succeeded with
the collective creativity of the two masters.
   ``We were like mountain climbers roped together,'' Braque
recalled.
   ``Almost every evening, either I went to Braque's studio or
Braque came to mine. Each of us had to see what the other had done
during the day,'' Picasso once said.
   Picasso and Braque pushed art beyond its traditional scope to a
pure abstraction. Through Cubism, which utilized cubes and other
geometric shapes to create forms, the two changed modern art.
   The exhibition includes 390 works in all mediums used by both
Picasso (1881-1973) and Braque (1882-1963). The works are on loan
from collections in Moscow, Leningrad, Paris, London, Stockholm,
Prague and Basel, and were also taken from the Museum of Modern
Art's own collection.
   In addition to the Picasso-Braque exhibition, here is a list of
other shows this season at some museums and galleries in the United
