<HEAD>Bahamian Official Blames US For Failed Interdiction Efforts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A senior official of the Bahamas is angered by
a State Department charge that ``systemic corruption'' in his
government is undermining a combined campaign against illicit drug
trafficking there.
   Paul L. Adderley, attorney general of the Bahamas, also disputed
recent testimony of an admitted marijuana smuggler that he paid
Prime Minister Lynden Pindling millions of dollars to protect
operations in the Caribbean country.
   ``What offends us the most is the judgment that if it were not
for corruption and indifference in this country, the Bahamas would
not and could not be used as a transit route for the smuggling of
Colombia cocaine and marijuana to South Florida,'' Adderley told a
Senate hearing Monday.
   ``If the corruption and indifference that is perceived were to
magically disappear, the rate of smuggling might not diminish at
all simply because I regret to say the United States has not put
the personnel, equipment and operating funds into doing what needs
to be done in the Bahamas,'' he said.
   He said it was ``untrue, unfair and distorts the real facts'' to
suggest that the Bahamas is not doing enough to halt the flow of 60
percent of the cocaine and marijuana that enters the United States
through his country.
   But Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said he still might vote to
deny further U.S. assistance to the Bahamas when the Senate deals
with the question of drug interdiction efforts by foreign countries
in the next few weeks.
   ``We already have too much rhetoric and empty promises,''
D'Amato said.
   Ann B. Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, combined criticism with praise for the Bahamas'
impressive narcotics seizures and cooperation with U.S. authorities.
   She said the joint interdiction of 24,860 pounds of cocaine and
146.5 tons of marijuana in the Bahamas last year was ``not equaled
in any other country in the Caribbean.''
   Nonetheless, she said: ``Narcotics-related corruption remains a
serious problem in the Bahamas. The Bahamian government has not
dealt effectively with systemic corruption, which continues to make
the Bahamas attractive to drug traffickers.''
   D'Amato and Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., questioned Adderley
closely about American marijuana smuggler George Baron's testimony
last week at the drug trial of Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos
Lehder in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Baron said he paid Pindling $3 million to $5 million from 1979
to 1981 in exchange for Bahamian protection for his activities.
Baron also quoted Lehder as saying he himself had paid Pindling
$200,000 a month in bribes.
   Baron said he once paid Pindling $400,000 at a gambling casino
on Paradise Island in the Bahamas in the fall of 1980, which
Adderley said was ``a totally incredible story, an unbelievable
story.''
   Adderley said he intended to investigate Baron's allegations.
But he also said that for Pindling to accept a bribe in a crowded
casino ``would be like the president of the United States taking a
bribe in Atlantic City.''

<HEAD>Bahamian Government Says It Will Confiscate Lehder's Property
Itself</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bahamian government has its own
ideas about the property of Carlos Lehder Rivas, whose conviction
on U.S. cocaine-smuggling charges led to a jury ruling that the
Colombian should forfeit his Bahamas assets to the United States.
   The Bahamas _ whose leader reportedly is a potential target of
the Lehder trial prosecutor _ plans to move to confiscate Lehder's
property itself, according to a statement released Friday by the
Bahamas Information Service.
   The Bahamas has laws that allow it to confiscate the land of
those convicted of drug trafficking outside the Bahamas and it will
use these provisions to confiscate Lehder's Bahamian assets, the
statement said.
   The statement lauded Lehder's conviction Thursday of charges
that he smuggled about 3.3 tons of cocaine from Colombia to the
United States via the Bahamas.
   A week ago, the Bahamian government took out full-page
advertisements in several major U.S. newspapers rebutting charges
by some U.S. officials and news media that it hasn't done enough to
stop drug smuggling and that its officials were bribed by smugglers.
   A federal jury found Lehder guilty of all 11 counts, ranging
from conspiracy to import cocaine to engaging in a continuing
criminal enterprise. Lehder has been identified as a leader of the
violent Medellin Cartel of Colombia.
   The panel deliberated another 10 hours Friday on a second phase
of the trial that resulted in the forfeiture of Lehder's Bahamian
assets.
   The convicted drug smuggler owned a large portion of Norman's
Cay, a Bahamian island about 40 miles southeast of Nassau. His
holdings included a 3,000-foot airstrip, three homes on Norman's
Cay and a condominium in Nassau. Lehder, 38, paid about $1.3
million for the property in the late 1970s, and prosecutors said
Lehder used Norman's Cay as his smuggling base. U.S. Attorney
Robert W. Merkle called it ``an aircraft carrier of cocaine.''
   ``The island is wrecked. But that is not to say it would not be
of some future value,'' Merkle said after the verdict on forfeiture.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller had urged the jury to
require Lehder to forfeit all his Bahamian assets.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton set sentencing for July 20.
Lehder faces up to life plus 150 years in prison and $350,000 in
fines. Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, who was found guilty on one
count of conspiracy, faces a maximum of 15 years behind bars and
$25,000 in fines.
   But Lehder attorney Edward Shohat told Melton after the jury was
dismissed that under the U.S.-Colombia treaty in existence at the
time of Lehder's extradition, his client should face a maximum of
only 30 years in prison. Merkle disagreed, and the judge asked both
sides to submit briefs on the question.
   Merkle refused to comment on reports that Bahamian Prime
Minister Lynden O. Pindling _ who trial witnesses said received
million-dollar bribes from Lehder _ is his next target.
   Pindling and his aides have denied the allegations, but have
said they understand a Florida grand jury is investigating the
matter.
   Lehder was extradited to the United States last year after a
firefight and his arrest by the Colombian army at a Medellin
mansion.
   U.S. drug enforcement officials have warned that while Ledher's
conviction is important, it alone will not stop the narcotics flow.
   ``You've got an awful lot of heads on the Hydra you have to cut
off,'' U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr Jim Simpson said Friday. ``Lehder
was one of them.''
   The Medellin Cartel still ships up to 80 percent of U.S. cocaine
imports. The DEA considered Lehder one of the four managers of the
cartel until his arrest early last year. The others have evaded _
and sometimes defied _ Colombian and U.S. justice.

   Prosecutors at the trial of alleged
drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas produced more than 100 witnesses over
22 weeks to show that he operated a multimillion-dollar smuggling
business centered on the Bahamas.
   While the prosecution tried to draw a noose around Lehder, it
also presented evidence of the key role of the Bahamas island
chain, and a federal grand jury reportedly is looking into the
activities of Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling.
   Lehder, 38, is accused of conspiring to smuggle 3.3 tons of
cocaine into the United States through his private island in the
Bahamas, Norman's Cay, from 1978 to 1980.
   The Colombian is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operation of
a continuing criminal enterprise. His co-defendant, Jack Carlton
Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged only with conspiracy.
   The prosecution rested its case against the two Thursday. The
defense is expected to begin Monday and to last at least two weeks.
   ``The issue in this case is not whether Mr. Lehder was a drug
smuggler but whether Mr. Lehder as an individual committed the 11
crimes charged,'' Ed Shohat, one of Lehder's attorneys, said last
week.
   When the jury selection started in October, attorneys said they
expected the trial to last from six weeks to three months. But,
counting jury selection and a two-week Christmas recess, the trial
has ended its 30th week.
   ``Carlos Lehder pursued a singular dream, a singular vision: to
be the king of cocaine transportation,'' U.S. Attorney Robert
Merkle said in his opening statement in mid-November. ``He was to
cocaine transportation what Henry Ford was to cars.''
   While in federal prison during the 1970s, Lehder began hatching
his plans to form a cocaine-smuggling empire, prosecutors said.
   The Colombian first began smuggling small amounts of the drug
inside the lining of suitcases, using young women as couriers,
according to testimony. The smuggling, witnesses testified, became
bolder as time progressed.
   Key prosecution witness Ed Ward, an admitted smuggler, described
Norman's Cay, about 45 miles southeast of Nassau, as the perfect
transshipment point. The island was sparsely populated, had a
3,000-foot airstrip and no police or customs officials.
   Ward testified that he flew 10 loads of Colombian cocaine into
the United States for Lehder, whom he met in 1979.
   The trial also has touched on alleged payoffs to Bahamian
officials, including allegations from numerous witnesses that
Pindling filled his pockets with bribes from smugglers such as
Lehder.
   Ward testified that he gave former Bahamian Agriculture Minister
George Smith $100,000 that was ``supposed to go directly to the
prime minister, Prime Minister Pindling.''
   Law enforcement sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
that Merkle has been presenting evidence about Pindling to a
federal grand jury in Tampa, including reams of material first
presented at the Lehder trial.
   Other news reports have said that the grand jury investigation
was located in Miami or Jacksonville, rather than Tampa.
   Merkle, when asked last week about whether a grand jury was
investigating Pindling, said, ``I can't comment on that.''
   Pindling's name has frequently been mentioned in relation to
drug investigations, but in 1984, a royal commission of inquiry in
the Bahamas found that Pindling had more money than known income,
but none of that appeared to be drug-related.
   Pindling won re-election a year ago by invoking the fear common
to small nations in this hemisphere that the United States is
meddling in their affairs.
   Bill Kalis, Pindling's spokesman in Nassau, said Friday he had
heard reports of grand jury investigations in Miami or
Jacksonville, but that Pindling didn't expect to be indicted.
   ``Most of the testimony at the Lehder trial is recycled from the
commission of inquiry,'' Kalis said. He added that the grand jury
``might be hearing some of the same plea-bargaining witnesses that
are appearing at the Lehder trial.'' Much of the testimony in the
trial has come from convicted drug smugglers granted immunity from
prosecution or awaiting sentencing.
   At one point in Lehder's trial, defense attorneys reminded
prosecutors and jurors that Pindling was not on trial.
   But in his opening statement, Merkle had told jurors, ``You also
will hear evidence that Carlos Lehder was making payoffs directly
the prime minister of the Bahamas, still the prime minister now,
Lynden Pindling.''
   Lehder is also charged in separate indictments in Los Angeles
and Miami.
   The Miami indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of
the so-called Medellin Cartel, believed to be responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into United States _ a drug
operation worth $8 billion each year.

  [Text] Nassau, Bahamas, Jan 23, CANA -- Bahamas has 
recorded a definite decline in trafficking of illegal drugs 
through a new anti-drug effort between the Bahamas, Turks and 
Caicos Islands and the United States, says Public Safety and 
Transport Minister Arlington Butler. 
  Operation Bahamas Turks and Caicos Islands (OPBAT), a 
cooperative effort involving the three territories, was started 
in April 1992 to stamp out the drug trade. 
  And already, 18 months later, Butler says cocaine 
trafficking through the islands has dropped. 
  The public safety minister added that the 1993 total for 
cocaine seizure, though not yet official, was expected to be 
just about 700 kilos. 
  "This is an 86 per cent decline from the 4.85 metric tons 
seized in 1992 and it is the lowest annual seizure total since 
late 1970," he said. 
  The minister explained that another first for the Bahamas in 
1993, was that there was not a single interception of cocaine at 
an airstrip in the Bahamas. 
  "The fact that only two airdrops were intercepted in 
Bahamian territorial waters compared to six in international 
waters show great respect for the OPBAT and an obvious decline 
in the traffic." 
  Butler noted that for the 18 months OPBAT has been in 
operation--from April, 1992, through December 31, 1993--only 
1.59 metric tons of cocaine was seized in Bahamas. 
  And 1.85 metric tons were seized in international waters, 
much of it close to the north coast of Cuba. 
  "I think we can conclude that our remarkable joint OPBAT 
programme has brought the traffic of cocaine from Colombia to 
South Florida through the Bahamas down to irreducible minimum 
during this 18 month period." 
  The public safety minister also reported a fall by more than 
half, in the number of cocaine addicts seeking treatment, as a 
direct result of the anti-drug programme. 
  This, he said, indicated that the drug problem was 
"receding" or "stable."

   An associate of Bahamian Prime Minister
Lynden Pindling and reputed leaders of Colombia's Medellin cocaine
cartel were charged with drug trafficking in a federal indictment
unsealed here today.
   The indictment also accuses alleged cartel leader Pablo Escobar
Gaviria of organizing the assassination of Colombian Justice
Minister Lara Bonilla in 1984.
   Other major figures among the 30 indicted were Everette
Bannister, a close friend of Pindling's, as well as reputed cartel
kingpins Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, Fabio
Ochoa Vasquez and Gonzalo Mejia.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Genzman said the indictment covers 1974
to the present and involved the importation of 44,000 pounds of
cocaine.
   The prosecutor refused to answer questions about continuing
allegations that Pindling himself was involved in the drug operation.
   The document charges that Barry Seal, an informant for the Drug
Enforcment Administration, was killed at the direction of Fabio
Ochoa, Escobar and other cartel members.
   Also indicted today was Jack Carlton Reed, co-defendant of cartel
leader Carlos Lehder Rivas. They were convicted here last year of
conspiring to import cocaine, and Lehder is serving a life sentence.
   ``The case was investigated after the trial of Carlos Lehder, who
is named as a co-conspirator in the indictment as a follow-up to the
trial,'' said Genzman.
   The indictment accuses many of the defendants of running a
continuing criminal enterprise _ punishable by a maximum life
sentence _ and conspiracy to import drugs.
   Bannister, who lives in Nassau, is charged with receiving bribes
to allow the cartel to use islands just off Florida as a way station
for drug shipments.
   Genzman said the United States would seek extradition of
Bannister. As for the cartel leaders, he noted it had taken six
years to get Lehder to the United States and expressed belief the
others would eventually be brought to justice.
   Gorman Bannister, Everette Bannister's son, is a protected
federal witness who testified the Lehder trial.
   During the trial, Bannister characterized his father, chairman of
Bahamas World Airlines and a consultant to Resorts International, as
an influence-peddler who took protection payoffs from drug smugglers
and regularly supplied Pindling with money.
   In 1987, the younger Bannister, wearing a hood, testified before
a Senate subcommittee about drug-related corruption in the Bahamas.
   Bannister testified at Lehder's trial that his father took money
from Lehder and former Jacksonville marijuana and cocaine smuggler
Edward Hayes Ward to help protect them from law enforcement.
   ``My father said he made a deal with Carlos to get $100,000 a
month to make Norman's Cay operational,'' Bannister testified in
February 1988, referring to Lehder's island trans-shipment point in
the Bahamas, 40 miles from Nassau.
   Gorman Bannister said that his father, who had access to police
intelligence information, also had warned Lehder about impending
raids on Norman's Cay.
   Several witnesses in the Lehder trial testified that they had
made payoffs to high Bahamian officials.
   The chief prosecution witness, Edward Ward, said he gave Bahamian
cabinet minister George Smith and Everette Bannister $100,000 that
was supposed to go to Pindling.
   George William Baron III testified in Lehder's trial that he paid
bribes to Pindling. He said he handed a briefcase containing
$400,0000 in a crowded casino lounge in September or October 1980 to
Pindling.
   Pindling has since denied the allegation. In 1984, the Royal
Bahamian Commission cleared him of any wrongdoing concerning
allegations that he took payoffs from drug smugglers. Pindling,
first elected in 1967, was re-elected in 1987.

   Leaders of Colombia's Medellin Cartel
were indicted Wednesday on charges of cocaine trafficking and
masterminding the slayings of the Colombian justice minister and a
U.S. drug informant.
   The sweeping indictment alleges that both Nicaragua and the
Bahamas were used as way stations for $1 billion in drug imports to
the United States. Among those charged is a close associate of
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling.
   The case ``once again shows that the United States is not going
to let up our efforts to catch these individuals who are supplying
drugs to the United States,'' U.S. Attorney Robert W. Genzman said.
``We feel that the pressure has got to be kept on regardless of how
many indictments come out in the United States against members of
the cartel.''
   In all, 30 people were charged in the ``second wave'' of
indictments resulting from last May's conviction of Carlos Lehder
Rivas, one of the leaders of the cartel, which officials say is
responsible for up to 80 percent of the cocaine imported into the
United States.
   The indictment accuses cartel leader Pablo Escobar Gaviria of
organizing the assassination of Colombian Justice Minister Rodrigo
Lara Bonilla on April 29, 1984, and says Escobar and Fabio Ochoa
Vasquez directed the Feb. 19, 1986, slaying of former Drug
Enforcement Administration informant Barry Seal.
   Other major figures indicted included cartel kingpins Jose
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Ochoa's brother Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, and
Gonzalo Mejia.
   None of the cartel members has been taken into custody, although
most have already been indicted in Miami. They are believed to be in
Colombia, officials said.
   Genzman noted that it took the government six years to get Lehder
to the United States. ``I am confident that in some point in time we
will be able to obtain custody of the others,'' he said.
   Also indicted was Jack Carlton Reed, who was Lehder's
co-defendant at last year's trial.
   Lehder and Reed were convicted here last May 19 of conspiring to
import cocaine. Lehder _ an unindicted co-conspirator in the new
indictment _ is serving a life sentence and Reed is serving a
15-year term.
   Genzman said the indictment covers a 15-year period from 1974 to
the present, and involves the importation of 44,000 pounds of
cocaine worth $1 billion.
   ``The indictment contains 205 snapshots of a long-term drug
conspiracy in action,'' Genzman said.
   ``The indictment traces Lehder's development into a primary
overseas transporter of cocaine for other Medellin Cartel members,
and his continued assocation with these members after they developed
their own tranportation operations,'' Genzman said.
   The indictment accuses Escobar, Rodriguez, Mejia, Reed and the
two Ochoas of running a continuing criminal enterprise _ punishable
by a maximum life sentence _ and conspiracy to import drugs.
   The indictment alleges that after the slaying of Bonilla in
Colombia the top cartel leaders fled Colombia, and eventually
traveled to Nicaragua. Lehder and others paid Nicaraguan officials
to allow them to stay in that country and use it as a base to
smuggle cocaine to the United States, the indictment says.
   They allegedly stored 1,400 kilograms of cocaine at Los Brasiles
Air Force Base in Nicaragua before flying it into the United States.
   The Bahamian charged in the indictment, Everette Bannister of
Nassau, is charged with receiving bribes to allow the cartel to use
the islands just off Florida's shores as a way station for drug
shipments.
   NBC News, citing unidentified federal law enforcement officials,
reported that an early draft of the indictment said Bannister shared
the alleged payoffs with Pindling and other Bahamian officials.
Pindling's name was dropped from the indictment after it was
reviewed by the Justice and State Departments in Washington, NBC
said. The network did not say whether the early draft named Pindling
as a defendant.
   Bannister's telephone in Nassau was busy Wednesday and he could
not be reached for comment. Bill Kalis, a spokesman for Pindling's
office, said the government of the Bahamas would have no comment on
the indictment.
   Genzman said the United States has an extradition treaty with the
Bahamas, and would seek custody of Bannister. He refused to answer
questions about continuing allegations that Pindling himself was
involved in the drug operation.
   Gorman Bannister, Everette Bannister's son, is a protected
federal witness who testified in Lehder's 1988 trial.
   In the trial, Bannister characterized his father, chairman of
Bahamas World Airlines and a consultant to Resorts International, as
an influence peddler who took protection payoffs from drug smugglers
and regularly supplied Pindling with money.
   In 1987, the younger Bannister, wearing a hood, testified before
a U.S. Senate subcommittee about drug-related corruption in the
Bahamas.
   Bannister testified in Lehder's trial that his father took money
from Lehder and former Jacksonville marijuana and cocaine smuggler
Edward Hayes Ward to help protect them from law enforcement efforts.
   ``My father said he made a deal with Carlos to get $100,000 a
month to make Norman's Cay operational,'' Bannister testified in
February 1988, referring to Lehder's island transshipment point in
the Bahamas, about 40 miles southeast of Nassau.
   Several witnesses in the Lehder trial testified that they had
made payoffs to high Bahamian officials, including Pindling, who has
denied the allegations.
   In 1984, the Royal Bahamian Commission cleared Pindling of any
wrongdoing concerning allegations that he took payoffs from drug
smugglers. Pindling, first elected in 1967, was re-elected in 1987.
   Aside from Reed, who was already in prison, only five of those
indicted Wednesday were immediately arrested, authorities said. They
were identified as Yemel Nacel of New York City, who is Lehder's
former wife; Barry Kane, a Hyannis, Mass., attorney; Jeffrey Edward
Lewis of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Diane Helen Thornhill of Southern
California; and Donald Gary Podesto of San Rafael, Calif.

Prime Minister Pindling Calls
June Election as New Drug Charges Swirl

   Corruption helped sweep Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling into power 20 years ago in this sun-drenched chain of 700 islands. 
Now, it may finally be about to sweep him out. 

   Yesterday, Mr. Pindling dissolved Parliament and scheduled an election for June 19. 
The race will be the fiercest political battle he and his Progressive Liberal Party, or PLP, have faced since 1967, when he helped expose a crooked white-minority government and launched the movement that won independence from Britain and made him a national hero. 

   Unemployment is high and drug abuse rampant, but the issue that threatens Mr. Pindling most is an old one with a new twist: A corruption scandal simmering for more than three years has boiled over again because of fresh charges that he and other top officials have been on the payrolls of international drug lords. 

   He denies the accusations. 
But the flare-up has heaped more pressure on his government and given the Free National Movement, or FNM, the opposition party mainly made up of former Pindling backers from the black middle class, its first real crack at unhorsing the charismatic leader. 

   Both sides predict landslide victories; most observers rate the race a toss-up. 
"Pindling and his friends have gone too far, at long last," says Kendal Isaacs, the FNM's leader who would become prime minister if his party wins. 
Even some members of Mr. Pindling's party are nervous. 
"It doesn't look so great at the moment," acknowledges Arthur Hanna, a PLP member of Parliment and former deputy prime minister, who is frequently at odds with the prime minister. 

   Though both parties are basically conservative and pro-Western, the elections could put a new spin on the often prickly relations between the U.S. and the Bahamas. 
Some U.S. officials believe fighting drug smugglers would be easier with Mr. Pindling out of power. 
A Pindling triumph, many here feel, could signal that corruption has become an officially sanctioned standard procedure in the Bahamas. 

   About 40% of the cocaine and much of the marijuana pouring into the U.S. comes through the Bahamas, the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington estimates. 
U.S. officials say Bahamian cooperation in combating traffickers has improved in recent years, but some grumble that it hasn't improved enough. 
American officals have been considering whether to take the drastic step of barring some of Mr. Pindling's closest confidants -- including some candidates for Parliament -- from entering the U.S. because of suspected involvement in drug running. 

   Scandal has been part of the lore of this smuggler's paradise since the days of Blackbeard, but the current corruption mess is setting records for duration and damage. 
A 1984 report by a government-appointed commission found that dozens of policemen, customs officers and public officials -- some of them Mr. Pindling's closest friends and political allies -- took payoffs from dope smugglers. 

   The report showed Mr. Pindling spent eight times what he earned as prime minister over a six-year period, but he wasn't linked directly to any bribes. 
He has branded as "lies" all allegations that he was ever involved with drug traffickers. 

   Since then, Mr. Pindling has fought off demands for an early election and survived a palace revolt in which five of his 13 cabinet ministers either quit or were fired. (Under Bahamian law, he had to call a national vote by the end of July.) 

   But he has done little to distance himself from the corruption imbroglio. 
He recently shocked U.S. officials and some of his own backers by resurrecting two cabinet ministers who were forced to resign in 1984 under a cloud of accusations about their ties to drug traffickers. 
Both men will run for Parliament with his blessing. 

   "That is outrageous," says Mr. Hanna, the PLP member, who some say wants to be prime minister himself. 
"Mr. 
Pindling has refused to make himself accountable to the Bahamian people." 

   Mr. Pindling, the Bahamas' first black prime minister, apparently has been counting on his popularity to win him a fifth five-year term. 
The strategy seemed to be working -- until Gorman Bannister showed up in Miami, suffering from cocaine burnout and loose lips. 

   Mr. Bannister is the son and former business partner of Everette Bannister, a lifelong friend of Mr. Pindling known on the islands as a political fixer. 
For the past few weeks, U.S. law-enforcement officials say, he has been giving them rich detail on his father's alleged dealings with traffickers. 
His most serious accusation: Mr. Pindling was the ultimate recipient of some protection money paid by Carlos Lehder, the Colombian cocaine czar who is in federal prison in Atlanta awaiting trial on charges of shipping tons of cocaine into the U.S. from an isolated Bahamian islet. 

   Mr. Pindling's supporters dismiss the younger Mr. Bannister's stories as ravings. 
Nonetheless, they have invigorated the FNM's campaign. 
"We've picked up enough votes since {the 1982 vote} to swing the election," says Arthur Foulkes, spokesman for the FNM. 
"The Bahamian people are sick of all this foolishness." 

   If graft alone carried much weight in the Bahamas, Mr. Pindling might have been sunk long ago. 
But other problems are fueling discontent with the government. 
Though the tourist trade is still booming and the Bahamas' estimated 8% growth in gross domestic product last year was the region's best, unemployment is stuck at roughly 20%. 

   And a lot of cocaine passing through on its way to America never gets there. 
The islands appear to be in the grip of a drug epidemic. 
"Cocaine is wiping out our young people," says David Allen of the National Drug Council, an anti-drug group partly funded by the government. 

   In a cramped hut that reeks of sweat and urine in a ragged neighborhood called the Grove, seven ghostly faces hover around a sputtering candle, smoking "cokome" -- powerful, free-base cocaine. 
This is a "base house," one of an estimated 100 in Nassau. 
Kids plunk down as little as 50 cents for a hit. 

   A red-eyed youth pulls on a ceramic pipe, smoke swirling around his head. 
Something is wrong. 
He is yelling, furious -- there's too much noise. 
"This is serious here, man," he snarls, quivering hands jabbing the air. 
"You're not here to talk, you're here to do drugs." 
After tense seconds of silence, he turns his attention back to his pipe. 

   Mr. Pindling's supporters say he's honest and that the opposition harps on the corruption issue because it has nothing else to offer. 
They credit the prime minister for the country's relative prosperity. 
"The Bahamian people know Mr. Pindling as a great and honorable leader," says Sean McWeeney, the PLP's chairman. 

   Recently, the prime minister has stepped up attacks on drug abuse and dusted off a proposal to boost the economy by developing tourism. 
In speeches, he rips his critics as "stooges" and "nincompoops," and says he's committed to working with the U.S. to stem the drug torrent. 

   Some people think if he wins this time he will be politically invincible. 
"It would be a tragedy for the nation," says Eileen Carron, editor of the nation's largest newspaper, the Tribune. 
"It would signal to undesirables everywhere that the Bahamas is where corruption is accepted, and where honor and integrity do not count."

<HEAD>Bahamian Prime Minister Attacks Drug Allegations as `Fairy Tales'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling
attacked allegations that he accepted bribes from drug traffickers
as ``absolutely untrue'' and said his government will stand up for
its sovereign rights.
   ``We will take our case to the world. We are citizens of the
world, and we have a right to be heard,'' Pindling told a rally
Wednesday night at a government schoolhouse.
   Earlier, Pindling released a statement denouncing the
allegations against him made in testimony during the U.S. drug
trial of reputed Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas, and
news reports in the United States that federal grand juries are
investigating him.
   Pindling, who led the archipelago of 700 islands and 225,000
people to independence after defeating the white-minority
government in 1967, was overwhelmingly re-elected last year in the
aftermath of a 1984 Royal Commission of Inquiry that studied
corruption in the Bahamian government and law enforcement. The
probe stopped short of linking Pindling directly to drug bribes.
   Pindling said in his statement he wasn't surprised by the
allegations that have been made at Lehder's trial, but would be
surprised if any of the grand juries reportedly investigating his
affairs indicted him.
   ``This is so because the testimony given concerning me is
totally and absolutely untrue,'' Pindling said. ``I have never been
offered a bribe and have never accepted a bribe.
   ``For any grand jury anywhere to produce indictments of the kind
speculated about in the press I would regard as a gross miscarriage
of justice and a serious breach of faith on the part of the U.S.
government,'' his statement said.
   Several prosecution witnesses testified at Lehder's trial in
Jacksonville, Fla., that Pindling took money from smugglers such as
Lehder, who allegedly used Norman's Cay in the Bahamas as a key
transfer point for Colombian cocaine bound for Florida and Georgia.
U.S. drug officials have estimated some 40 percent of all South
American cocaine reaches the United States from Bahamian transfer
points.

MR Hubert Ingraham, a 45-year-old lawyer, is to be sworn in as prime
minister of the Bahamas following victory, in a general election on
Wednesday, over Sir Lynden Pindling, the archipelago's premier for the past
25 years.
Provisional results give Mr Ingraham's Free National Movement at least 31 of
the 49 seats contested, with the remainder going to Sir Lynden's Progressive
Liberal party.
Mr Ingraham had focused his campaign on attacking Sir Lynden's handling of
the economy, which is based on tourism and offshore financial services. He
promised to sell off state-owned enterprises, including several hotels.
The prime minister-elect was a senior member of Sir Lynden's party until his
dismissal in 1984. Mr Ingraham claimed he was fired because he had advocated
the sacking of officials who were publicly linked to narcotics trafficking.
Mr Ingraham will be faced with a need to restore local and foreign
confidence in the economy. He has promised to turn initially to problems in
the tourism sector, which has suffered from the international recession.
He pledged to 'heal' the nation, encouraging blacks and whites to
participate in the economy. 'You removed from office the longest-serving
elected leader in the Commonwealth, perhaps anywhere, and you have done it
peacefully through the electoral process. And for that I congratulate the
Bahamas,' Mr Ingraham told supporters.
Sir Lynden, 62, was one of the longest-serving prime ministers in the
Commonwealth, and has been a colourful and controversial figure.
Advocating increased economic opportunities in the Bahamas for black people,
who make up 85 per cent of the population, Sir Lynden has always argued that
he was seeking economic justice for all Bahamians.
However, his administration had been accused of being corrupt. In 1983,
there were allegations in the US that senior officials of the Bahamian
government, including Sir Lynden, were involved in drug smuggling. He axed
several officials and denied that he was involved.
The charges appeared to have had little effect on his popularity, as the PLP
won elections in 1987.

<HEAD>Residents of Bahamas Brace for Hugo's Passage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Islanders boarded up their homes and
bought supplies Tuesday as Hurricane Hugo, blamed in at least 25
deaths, swept along the Bahamas after leaving an estimated 50,000
people homeless in the eastern Caribbean.
   Weather officials said the hurricane would begin affecting the
British colony of Turks and Caicos Islands southeast of the Bahamas
chain on Tuesday night. The storm was moving on a parallel course
east of the Bahamas.
   ``All of the islands at some time or another are going to get
some effects (from Hugo),'' said Noel Risnychok, specialist with the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   Weather officials in the Bahamas feared Hugo could drift westward
toward more populated islands, including New Providence.
   That island, which includes the Bahamas capital city of Nassau,
is the most populated with an estimated 135,000 people.
   The government of the Bahamas Tuesday downgraded the hurricane
watch for the central Bahamas to a tropical storm warning. A
tropical storm warning remained in effect for the southern Bahamas,
though it was discontinued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, the hurricane's center was near
latitude 23.8 degrees north and longitude 69.5 west, about 190 miles
east northeast of Grand Turk Island in the southern Bahamas,
according to the National Weather Service.
   Hugo was moving in a northwesterly direction at about 12 miles
per hour with its highest sustained winds at 105 mph.
   Government officials in Nassau were monitoring the hurricane but
had not made any special preparations Tuesday for Hugo, said Bill
Kalis, press secretary for the government's information office.
   Residents were told to monitor weather advisories but could go
about their daily businesses, he said.
   ``They were telling everybody to get the water, the lamps
handy,'' said Dorothea Seymour of Naussau, who has a stall at The
Straw Market on Bay Street. ``We never had a storm here for some
years. We're always hearing about storms, but they never come.
   ``Some people worry, some people don't,'' she said.
   ``Although the indications are that it's going to move east of
the more populated areas, no one is relaxing their vigil because it
can change direction,'' Kalis said.
   Kalis said residents were gathering supplies in preparation.
   ``The stores have reported brisk sales of supplies such as
flashlight batteries and lumber for boarding up windows,'' he said.
   Weather officials in the Bahamas said Hugo's threat to the
northwestern Bahamas has intensified because of the
west-northwestern drift that the hurricane is expected to take.
   ``This westward drift can spell trouble for the northwestern
Bahamas which includes the bulk of the population,'' said Ken
Lightbourne, chief meteorological officer for the government's
weather agency in Nassau.
   Officials with Paradise Island Airlines in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
said they had not changed flight schedules yet, but were monitoring
the hurricane's path.
   ``We're just keeping a close eye on it like everybody else,''
said Hugh Riesdorph, director of flight operations for the airlines.
   He said the company makes 11 round-trip flights daily from Fort
Lauderdale and Miami to Paradise Island, which is linked by a bridge
to Nassau.

   Leaders of a Colombian drug cartel
bribed Nicaraguan officials for use of a military base as a way
station for 3,000 pounds of cocaine before smuggling it into this
country, according to a federal indictment.
   Leaders of the Medellin cartel masterminded the slayings of the
Colombian justice minister and a U.S. drug informant, according to
the federal District Court indictment unsealed Wednesday.
   The indictment accuses 30 people, including an associate of the
Bahamian prime minister, of participating in a ring that imported 22
tons of cocaine _ $1 billion worth _ into the United States.
   ``This is an encompassing indictment that talks about the whole
system of importing cocaine from Colombia through the Bahamas to the
United States beginning in about 1974 and continuing into 1989,''
said Jack Hook, a DEA spokesman.
   Those indicted are tied to Carlos Lehder Rivas, the Colombian
drug kingpin who was convicted in Jacksonville last year of
smuggling cocaine into the United States.
   ``This prosecution will further dismantle the Medellin cartel and
its distribution network in the United States,'' U.S. Attorney
Robert W. Genzman said of the latest indictments.
   The cartel, named for the Colombian city where it is based, is
considered the world's largest cocaine trafficking ring. It's said
to be responsible for up to 80 percent of the cocaine imported into
the United States.
   The indictment accuses reputed cartel leader Pablo Escobar
Gaviria of organizing the 1984 assassination of Colombian Justice
Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Escobar and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez also
directed the 1986 slaying of former Drug Enforcement Administration
informant Barry Seal, the indictment charges.
   After the minister's slaying, cartel leaders fled the South
American country and eventually traveled to Nicaragua, the
indictment said. They stored 3,000 pounds of cocaine at Los Brasiles
Air Force Base in the leftist-ruled country before flying it into
the United States, the indictment said.
   In May 1984, Lehder and other cartel leaders arranged to pay
Nicaraguan officials large sums of money to allow them to remain in
the Central American nation and to use it as a base for smuggling
cocaine to the United States, the indictment said. In addition, in
July 1984, a Piper Navajo owned by Lehder was given to the
Nicaraguan government as a gift, the indictment said.
   Also indicted was Everette Bannister, a close associate of
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling. Bannister was accused of
taking money from the cartel to allow the island nation off
Florida's shores to be used as a way station for drug imports.
   Bannister's telephone in Nassau was busy during repeated calls
from The Associated Press. Bill Kalis, a spokesman for Pindling's
office, said the Bahamian government would have no comment on
Bannister's indictment.
   NBC News, citing unidentified federal law enforcement officials,
reported that an early draft of the indictment said Bannister shared
the alleged payoffs with Pindling and other Bahamian officials.
Pindling's name was dropped from the indictment after it was
reviewed by the Justice and State departments in Washington, NBC
said. The network did not say whether the early draft named Pindling
as a defendant.
   Genzman refused to answer questions about continuing allegations
that Pindling was involved. He did say that the United States has an
extradition treaty with the Bahamas and would seek Bannister's
extradition.
   Other major figures indicted were reputed cartel kingpins Jose
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, Ochoa's brother Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and
Gonzalo Mejia. Most of the cartel members were earlier indicted in
Miami but have not been arrested.
   Also indicted was Jack Carlton Reed, a pilot who is serving a
15-year prison sentence for his conviction with Lehder.
   Escobar, Rodriguez, Mejia, Reed and the Ochoa brothers are
accused of running a continuing criminal enterprise _ punishable by
a maximum life sentence _ and conspiracy to import drugs.
   Lehder, an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment, is
serving a life sentence.
   Only five of those indicted were arrested: Yemel Nacel of New
York City, who is Lehder's former wife; Barry Kane, a Hyannis,
Mass., attorney; Jeffrey Edward Lewis of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.;
Diane Helen Thornhill and Donald Gary Podesto of California,
authorities said.
   Last April, the Columbian Supreme Court negated a 1979
extradition treaty with the United States on a constitutional
technicality.
   Genzman noted that it took the U.S. government six years to get
Lehder to this country.
   ``I am confident that in some point in time we will be able to
obtain custody of the others,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Bahamian government took out a
full-page advertisement Tuesday in U.S. and Caribbean newspapers in
an attempt at ``setting the record straight'' about new allegations
of corruption and lack of anti-drug efforts.
   The Bahamas decided to buy the ads as part of its response to
charges of Bahamian drug corruption raised in various quarters,
including the federal trial of Colombia's reputed drug kingpin,
Carlos Lehder Rivas, government spokesman Bill Kalis said.
   The ad in The New York Times, Washington Post, Miami Herald and
other newspapers was addressed to ``the people of the United States
of America'' and signed by Bahamian Attorney General Paul L.
Adderly.
   It says the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has devoted much of its
limited resources to fighting drugs and needs more U.S. aid.
   Specifically, the ad cites the need for ``more air search radar
installations, more joint bases strategically located with
helicopter strike force teams, more air reconnaissance patrols,
more sea patrols and intensified joint undercover and conspiracy
investigations.''
   It says the archipelago of 700 islands and keys and 250,000
people spends 13 percent of its national budget on law enforcement,
mostly fighting drugs produced in South America and bound for users
in the United States.
   Published reports have said grand juries in Tampa and Miami are
investigating Prime Minister Sir Lynden O. Pindling. And reports in
Congress have raised doubts about Bahamian drug-fighting efforts.
   ``He started thinking about this during these latest allegations
at the Lehder trial,'' Kalis said.
   ``As you know, the position was not to respond while the
testimony was being heard. Now that the testimony is over, the
prime minister wanted to take an opportunity to make the Bahamian
position better known.''
   During Lehder's trial in Jacksonville, U.S. Attorney Robert
Merkle had produced testimony that Pindling was receiving drug
payoffs of up to $5 million. Lehder allegedly used Norman's Cay in
the Bahamas as a key transfer point for Colombian cocaine bound for
Florida and Georgia.
   Adderly's advertisement Tuesday called attention to a 1984 Royal
Commission of Inquiry report in the Bahamas that criticized lack of
cooperation by U.S. authorities during its probe into official drug
corruption. That commission found evidence of drug corruption in
some levels of the Bahamian government and law enforcement, but did
not tie Pindling to drug payoffs.
   Last week, Pindling issued a statement to the news media and at
a rally flatly denying taking drug payoffs.
   Pindling said he was not surprised by the allegations at
Lehder's trial but would be surprised if any of the grand juries
reportedly investigating his affairs indicted him.
   Pindling was re-elected last year after criticizing the
corruption allegations, which first surfaced in a 1983 report. He
has been in power since breaking the hold of the white-minority
government in 1967.

<TEXT>
   The Bahamas has become more cooperative with the
United States in an anti-drug effort, while chances are diminishing
that the islands' prime minister will face a drug indictment in
this country, a newspaper reports.
   The Bahamian government has joined the United States in combined
drug raids and allowed a U.S. Customs base on Gun Cay south of
Bimini, The Miami Herald reported Monday.
   ``We're at a very high level of cooperation at this point,''
said Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan in Miami.
   Sheehan's statement was echoed by Jack Hook, spokesman for the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
   But chances that the prime minster, Sir Lynden O. Pindling,
could be prosecuted on drug-related charges appear remote because
of obstacles in an ongoing probe of an overseas drug-smuggling
network.
   First, the shaky status of federal drug indictments in Miami and
Tampa against Panama Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has raised doubts
about whether the United States would want to indict a foreign head
of state. The Reagan administration reportedly has offered to drop
the indictments in a deal in which Noriega would step down from
power.
   ``I find very little incentive indicting foreign potentates if
the State Department can negotiate them right out from under my
feet,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who has indicated he'll
quit if the indictment against Noriega is dropped.
   Merkle, of Tampa, has refused to comment on the reported probe
of Pindling.
   The Herald said a grand jury in Orlando is hearing testimony
against Pindling, the Bahamian leader since 1967 who was re-elected
last year after his government was rocked by a drug-corruption
scandal.
   The Herald, citing a ``well-placed source,'' said a July 4
deadline has been set for an indictment of Pindling.
   Another major obstacle, The Herald said, is the statute of
limitations. Pindling's probe stemmed from testimony given by
prosecution witnesses in the Jacksonville federal trial of
convicted Colombian drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas.
   Most of the allegations raised against Pindling in the Lehder
trial involved incidents in the late 1970s and 1980, which would
put them past the five-year statute of limitations.
   Merkle prosecuted Lehder, who was accused of using the private
Bahamian island of Norman's Cay as a cocaine trans-shipment point
and was convicted on all drug counts he faced.
   During Lehder's trial, Merkle called Pindling ``a
co-conspirator.'' Prosecution witness George Baron said Bahamian
police were guarding the prime minister when he delivered a
suitcase with $400,000 to Pindling in 1980 for alleged protection
of Baron's marijuana-smuggling through the Bahamas.
   Pindling, in a May 4 statement, denied Baron's story and charges
of corruption and bribe-taking. The Bahamian government ran
full-page ads May 10 in U.S. newspapers stressing its commitment to
fighting drugs and protesting what they called old allegations.
   A 1984 Royal Commission of Inquiry detailed corruption in lower
levels of the Bahamian government and law enforcement, but stopped
short of linking Pindling to the drug corruption.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Say Drug Smugglers Took Over Bahamian Island</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers have all but taken over the
Bahamian island of South Bimini, chasing off U.S. patrol boats with
gunfire and intimidating the Bahamian military, say Customs Service
reports and law enforcement officials.
   A Bahamian police lieutenant on the island even removed a
suspected drug smuggler from a U.S. boat and freed him, says a U.S.
Customs Service report obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.
   Customs Service spokesman Michael Sheehan and Coast Guard
spokesman Lt. Jeff Karonis refused to give details of the case,
saying the matter is being handled by the U.S. Embassy in Nassau,
the Bahamas.
   Bahamian government spokesman Edward Ellis said he could not
comment immediately on the incidents.
   Drug officials are reluctant to talk on the record about the
situation for fear of endangering joint U.S.-Bahamian drug
interdiction efforts, but said privately that the island is out of
control.
   ``The situation in South Bimini is near anarchy,'' a federal law
enforcement official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``The drug smugglers alone control the island, and
police corruption is obvious.''
   U.S. drug officials have long complained of high-level
protection of drug smugglers and a 1984 Royal Commission of Inquiry
found low-level corruption. The Bahamian government strenuously
denies any wrongdoing by current leaders, however.
   On Wednesday, the Senate defeated 57-40 a resolution by Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., to revoke President Bush's certification that
the government of the Bahamas has fully cooperated in the war on
drugs. Decertification could have cost the Bahamas nearly all of
its U.S. foreign aid and other privileges.
   South Bimini, only about 45 miles from Florida, was finally
raided May 7 by Bahamian troops who made at least one arrest and
seized six pounds of marijuana and two weapons. U.S. Embassy
officials point to the raid by the Royal Bahamian Defense Force to
show good faith by the nation's government.
   ``They sent in about 50 RBDF people _ that's a major raid for
here. I don't think that's any evidence of lack of cooperation,''
said Martin Cheshes, charge d'affaires at the embassy in Nassau.
   But drug agents here say they are not impressed with the
Bahamian raid, complaining that such actions are rare and usually
late.
   ``It is gotten to the point that our people are being shot at by
snipers using machine guns,'' the law enforcement source said.
``The Bahamian government is closing its eyes to what's going on,
allowing Bimini to be used as a thoroughfare for drugs.''
   The raid was staged five days after Coast Guard and Customs
Service officials, assisted by the Royal Bahamian Defense Force,
responded to an apparent air-drop of drugs on South Bimini's coast
and were thwarted by angry crowds.
   Cheshes said the delay was caused by the time it took reports to
get to Nassau, and the difficulty of mounting a major operation in
the small country.
   Two boats believed involved in the drop were intercepted and
three people taken into custody. But when the group docked outside
the South Bimini Hotel to allow the Bahamian soldiers to search for
drugs, about 75 people gathered, according to the Customs report.
   ``The angry crowd would not let the RBDF on shore to search for
the contraband,'' the report said.
   The task force withdrew and then intercepted another vessel
carrying two Cuban-Americans and two Bahamians.
   The two Bahamians insisted repeatedly on being taken to the
South Bimini police station instead of RBDF headquarters on another
island.
   One Bahamian jumped overboard and swam to shore. When the
Customs boats headed to shore to rearrest him, a Bahamian police
lieutenant took the second Bahamian off the boat and freed him at
the hotel while another crowd gathered.
   The Bahamian soldiers threatened to fire on the crowd, but
members of the mob said they would shoot back and the task force
again decided to withdraw. The following day, a U.S. Customs vessel
returned to the island and came under small arms fire, the report
said.

BAHAMAS PRIME MINISTER SAYS U.S. FAILS TO BACK UP DRUG-WAR PLEDGE

Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling charged Thursday that the United 
States, while complaining about poor anti-drug cooperation from Caribbean 
nations, for five years has failed to back up promises to provide a 
high-technology radar balloon for detecting cocaine shipments through the 
archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
The forceful criticism of U.S. drug interdiction efforts came as Pindling, 
whose government has been implicated in cocaine-trafficking activities, mounts 
a new campaign to position himself in the forefront of mounting international 
anti-narcotics efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In a breakfast session with reporters and editors of The Times' Washington 
Bureau, Pindling urged the United States to expand its war on drugs by ordering 
the immediate recall of all large-denomination currency to hamper drug lords 
who must deal in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"This would convert rich traffickers and their helpers into paupers overnight," 
the Bahamian leader says. 
</P>
<P>
Pindling also endorsed a proposed multilateral anti-drug task force that would 
dispatch troops around the world to help nations eradicate illegal drug crops. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about what the State Department has called the disparity between such 
"public pronouncements" and the extent of corruption in his government, 
Pindling freely conceded that the indictments of several of his associates on 
drug charges have taken a toll on him. 
</P>
<P>
The Pindling associates indicted in the United States earlier this year were 
Kendal W. Nottage, a member of the Bahamian Parliament, and Everette Bannister, 
a longtime business associate of the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Nottage was charged in Boston in a federal tax conspiracy indictment alleging 
that he and others conspired to conceal the illegal drug profits of organized 
crime figure Salvatore M. Caruana from the Internal Revenue Service. Bannister 
was charged in Florida in an indictment alleging that he conspired with the 
Colombian Medellin drug cartel to move drugs through the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
In the his interview Thursday, the prime minister insisted that the Bahamas 
"never has been" a haven for drug traffickers. He accused the United States of 
adopting a double standard in singling out the Bahamas for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that all of our fellows are angels," he said, "but don't you 
try and make out to me that all of yours are angels. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't apply a yardstick abroad in the Bahamas that you aren't prepared to 
apply at home," the prime minister warned.

   Jurors in the case of Carlos Lehder
Rivas decided Friday that the government can confiscate millions of
dollars in real estate on a Bahamian island, as well as several
planes and other items owned by the convicted drug dealer.
   ``The island is wrecked. It is trashed. But that is not to say
it would not be of some future value,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle
said.
   The same jury had found the 38-year-old Colombian guilty on all
11 drug-trafficking counts Thursday after seven days of
deliberations. Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, was found guilty
on one count of conspiracy.
   The issue of property forfeiture has to be considered separately
under federal law.
   During Thursday's hearing on that, Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst
Mueller urged the jurors to allow the government to confiscate a
large portion of Norman's Cay, an airstrip, a marina, three homes,
a condominium and several planes. The island was Lehder's smuggling
base from 1978 to 1980.
   ``If you prosecute a drug smuggler without taking his property,
only part of the job has been accomplished,'' said Mueller.
   According to Internal Revenue Service figures, Lehder earned an
estimated $250 million in the cocaine business.
   After 10 hours of deliberations the jury agreed Friday to all
the forfeitures. But the question of how the government could take
control of property in the Bahamas was not clear.
   Lehder faces up to life plus 150 years in prison and $350,000 in
fines when he is sentenced July 20. Reed faces a maximum of 15
years and $25,000 in fines.
   Lehder's attorney, Edward Shohat, told U.S. District Judge
Howell W. Melton after the jury was dismissed Friday that under the
U.S.-Colombia treaty in existence at the time of Lehder's
extradition, his client might face a maximum of only 30 years in
prison. Merkle disagreed, and the judge asked both sides to submit
briefs on the question.
   Meanwhile, Merkle refused again Friday to confirm reports that
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling _ who trial witnesses
said received million-dollar bribes from Lehder _ is his next
target.
   Pindling and his aides have denied taking bribes, but have said
they understand a Florida grand jury is investigating the matter.
   Merkle said he could not confirm the existence of such an
investigation.
   Although Lehder was only on trial for smuggling 3.3 tons of
cocaine from Colombia via Norman's Cay in the Bahamas into deserted
airstrips in Florida and Georgia, the government presented
testimony that Lehder smuggled 18,000 kilos.
   Lehder has been identified as being one of the leaders of the
violent Medellin cartel, the Colombian organization also reputedly
headed by Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Jose
Rodriguez Gacha.
   The seven-month trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115
government witnesses, along with mounds of documents. Lehder was
extradited to the United States last year following a firefight and
his arrest by the Colombian army at a Medellin mansion.
   During the trial, Merkle called Lehder the Henry Ford of drug
trafficking, the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern,
high-tech operation, using airdrops and speed boats.
   Lehder also is under indictment in Miami for his role in the
cartel and a sealed indictment in Los Angeles, but officials said
it is unlikely that he can be tried for those offenses.

<F P=106> [Article by Maryann Burrows: "U.S. To Cut Back $500,000 in </F>
Drug War Funds"] 
  [Text] The International Narcotic Matters [INM] grant that 
supported many drug programmes in the Bahamas will be cut by 
half a million dollars this year, Deputy Prime Minister Orville 
Turnquest announced at a joint Bahamas/United States drug 
interdiction meeting today. 
  And while it has been indicated that Operation-BAT and the 
Aerostat would not be affected, it will take great ingenuity to 
ensure that the loss of $500,000 does not significantly impair 
the effectiveness of the Bahamas/U.S. cooperative efforts, Mr. 
Turnquest said. 
  "It will be most unfortunate that the successes which we 
have 
achieved today over the last seven years, should be reversed in 
any way by a reduction of this kind in our financial resources. 
  We state on other occasions the Bahamas is unable to 
increase its resources which are allocated to drug control 
activities. A budgetary allotment into this area is now 15 per 
cent of our total national budget," he said. 
  Mr. John Ford, U.S. Charge d'Affaires to the Bahamas said 
that the cut in the INM budget for Nassau is also regretted. But 
U.S. officials are commitment to OPBAT in terms of money, 
resources and personnel. 
  Mr. Ford said that the corporation between the Bahamas and 
the United States, continues to shine as an example for other 
bilateral and multi-lateral efforts. 
  Mr. Orville Turnquest said that the Bahamas joint task force 
exercise has become a singularly successful and unique 
continuing enterprise against the scourge of drug trafficking. 
  He said he was delighted that the results to date seem to 
indicate that while "we may not yet have won the war," the 
battle has been continuing. 
  Mr. Turnquest said good news stem from the statistics 
indicating the successful results of the joint enterprise 
between the Bahamas and the United States. 
  "The amount of cocaine seized in Bahamian waters during the 
first three quarters of 1993, has returned downwards to 1980 
level. We are told that a mere 520 pounds of cocaine or 240 
kilos, were seized in Bahamian territory in the first three 
quarters of 1993," said Mr. Turnquest. 
  "Of those totals the largest seizure in Bahamian territory 
for 1993, was an air drop retrieved by OPBAT in July. This, I 
believe, is proof of the success of this cooperative effort 
between our two countries. 
  OPBAT was also successful in seizing 2,546 pounds of cocaine 
in international waters. This reflects in my mind the reduction 
in the trend of drug trafficking activities in 1992, when the 
bulk of cocaine seizures occurred in Bahamian waters."

   A federal judge says America was
sending a signal to drug traffickers when he sentenced Carlos
Lehder Rivas to life imprisonment without parole for smuggling tons
of cocaine into the United States.
   ``Cocaine is viewed as a national tragedy in this country,''
U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton told the Colombian drug dealer
Wednesday. ``Those who profit from this are the worst kinds of
offenders.''
   The harsh sentence, life plus 135 years in prison and fines
totaling $350,000, was ``a signal of our society'' that it will
strongly punish those fueling ``this cancer'' of drugs, Melton said.
   The judge also said Lehder's criminal motivation was greed,
adding that he showed ``no concern for the destruction of others.''
   There was no visible reaction from Lehder, who wore a gray
business suit.
   Lehder, 38, a reputed leader of Colombia's violent Medellin
Cartel, was sentenced for smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine from his
homeland via the Bahamas to rural airstrips in Florida and Georgia.
   He was convicted on 11 counts of conspiracy, importation of
cocaine and possession with intent to distribute. Melton also
ordered the confiscation of Lehder's possessions in the Bahamas:
three homes, an airstrip, hotel, condominium and marina.
   The seizure is in dispute, with the Bahamian government
contending the United States has no right to the property and that
it intended to assume possession.
   Lehder contended he had been ``a hostage'' to prosecutor Robert
Merkle, who resigned as U.S. attorney for central Florida shortly
after the seven-month trial to run for the Republican U.S. Senate
nomination.
   Lehder claimed Merkle used him as a symbol of evil to generate
``free publicity for his Senate campaign.''
   He charged he had been kidnapped and illegally brought to the
United States because he had been a political leader in Colombia,
working to overthrow the U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty.
   Outside the courtroom, Merkle's replacement, U.S. Attorney Joe
Magri, dismissed Lehder's allegations.
   He said the judge had ``fairly, justly and appropriately socked
it to a hoodlum.''
   The heavy sentence ``sends a clear message that we're serious
about stopping narcotics traffic,'' Magri said, calling Lehder a
``cocaine narco-terrorist.''
   The defendant, who said he had dual citizenship in the United
States and Colombia, asked Melton to deport him to Colombia or
Germany.
   Defense attorneys Edward Shohat and Jose Quinon had asked the
judge to impose a 20-year sentence at most, which they said would
be four times longer than the terms being served by the smugglers
who testified against Lehder.
   They said Lehder would appeal the conviction and sentence.
   After listening to almost four hours of arguments and objections
from Lehder's attorneys to pre-sentence reports, Melton told the
defendant that the government had presented ``monumental amounts of
incriminating evidence against you.''
   Testimony during the lengthy trial alleged that Bahamian
officials, including Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling, helped
Lehder's drug ring smuggle more than 20 tons of cocaine into the
United States.
   Pindling and his aides have repeatedly denied the allegations.
   Lehder was arrested and extradited to the United States last
year after a gunbattle at his mansion in Medellin.
   He also is under indictment in Miami for his role in the cartel,
and there is a sealed indictment against him in Los Angeles. But
officials have said it is highly unlikely that he will be tried on
those charges.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., a
pilot in the drug-smuggling ring, stood silently earlier in the day
as he was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $25,000 for his
conviction on a single conspiracy count. Government witnesses had
testified that he ferried 2,500 pounds of cocaine on at least seven
flights from the Bahamas.

  [Text] Nassau, Bahamas, 1 Feb, CANA -- Opposition leader 
Sir Lynden Pindling and his Progressive Liberal Party [PLP] 
Monday night tabled a motion of no confidence against Prime 
Minister Hubert Ingraham, over the recent resignation of Justice 
Ira Rowe from the Bahamas Court of Appeals. 
  He also tabled a resolution condemning the justice minister 
and the attorney general. Pindling claimed that new evidence had 
surfaced in the abrupt resignation of the Jamaican judge. 
Additional information, he claimed, has convinced the opposition 
that the 17-month-old government, through Justice Minister Janet 
Bostwick, interfered with the judicial process. 
  Pindling, former prime minister of 25 years, also claimed 
that Attorney General Orville Turnquest presented a misleading 
position in a television interview, and that Ingraham misled 
parliament in a communication on the matter. 
  Ingraham branded Pindling's allegation an "outright lie." He 
said he had no problem with such a debate and offered to change 
the House of Assembly's agenda on Wednesday and Thursday to 
accommodate the PLP. 
  "It is dead wrong for Sir Lynden Pindling to seek to mislead 
the Bahamian public and bring into contempt the judicial 
system," Ingraham said. The government, he continued, was 
completely satisfied that it acted in the best interest of the 
people and consistent with its oath of office to uphold the laws 
of The Bahamas. 
  Rowe resigned in December after the Ministry of Justice, 
through the registrar of the supreme court, told him that it was 
not prepared to facilitate his presence in Nassau to hear an 
appeal challenging the lawfulness of a commission of inquiry 
appointed to investigate allegations of misuse of public funds 
under the former Pindlng regime. The appeal was lodged by 
Maurice Glinton, lawyer for Phillip Herman Bethel. The inquiry 
was told that Bethel indirectly received a substantial amount of 
maoney that had been paid by Boeing of Canada as commission on 
the sale of Dehavilland aircraft to the state-owned Bahamasair. 
Bethel is the son of Philip Bethel, a former Bahamasair chairman 
and PLP minister. During the recent hearing, Justice Vincent 
Melville, chairman of The Bahamas Court of Appeals, stated that 
he was telephoned by Justice Rowe last December 4. Justice Rowe 
informed the president that he had an application for Glinton. 
  Justice Melville said he informed Justice Rowe not to deal 
with the matter as there was someone in The Bahamas who could 
deal with it. Glinton had flown to Jamaica to get Justice Rowe 
to entertain his application. Ingraham said that the chief 
justice of The Bahamas has always dealt with applications of 
appeal since the court of appeal was established in The Bahamas 
28 years ago. 
  Ingraham said that his government was sworn to uphold the 
laws of The Bahamas and not to allow anyone "under any cloak" to 
subvert the laws of the country.

   Colombia's justice minister on Thursday shrugged off
U.S. charges against leaders of the infamous Medellin Cartel, saying
the country faced a much bigger crisis than pursuing reputed cocaine
kingpins.
   ``For the American government, drug trafficking is the biggest
problem,'' said Guillermo Plazas Alcid. ``For us, it is one of many,
including terrorism and subversion.''
   Thirty people, including reputed cartel leaders, were indicted in
Jacksonville on Wednesday, accused of smuggling $1 billion in
cocaine into the United State through the Bahamas and other points.
   Plazas, who had no visible security guards, told a luncheon
gathering of 130 members of the Colombian American Chamber of
Commerce that the South American nation was doing its best to
confront the drug issue, but extraditing cartel leaders for
prosecution in the United States was not an option.
   The extradition treaty between the two countries was invalidated
by Colombia's supreme court after the capture of cartel co-leader
Carlos Lehder Rivas, convicted last year and sentenced to life in
prison for cocaine trafficking to the United States.
   Since then, the extradition issue has been on hold. Asked what
effect Wednesday's sweeping drug-trafficking indictment might have,
Plazas simply replied, ``the extradition treaty can't be applied.''
   Among those indicted was Pablo Escobar Gaviria, an alleged leader
of the cartel accused of plotting the assassination of Colombian
Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla in 1984 and the 1986 slaying
of drug informant Barry Seal.
   Plazas discussed for nearly an hour the reform and strengthening
of Colombia's judicial system in response to drug trafficking,
guerrilla activity, common delinquency and the weakening of the
public and private sectors.
   ``If we are not at the edge of the abyss, then we're getting to
the point of almost no return,'' Plazas said. ``This is like a
gigantic nuclear mushroom cloud penetrating the whole society.''
   Plazas said Colombia, as a producing nation, should not bear sole
reponsibility for the drug problem and insisted it was a worldwide
issue that needed to be addressed on that scale.
   ``Colombia is not responsible for drug trafficking _ it is a
victim,'' he said. ``We are all victims.''
   He referred to the United State's swift reaction to tainted
Chilean fruit, saying this country had the power to respond with
equal vigor to drug trafficking.
   U.S. prosecutors said they were confident many of the 30
defendants named in the Jacksonville indictment would eventually
face prosecution. In addition to Escobar, the indictment _ charging
bribery, murder and conspiracy to import 44,000 pounds of cocaine _
named alleged cartel leaders Jose Rodriguez Gacha, Gonzalo Mejia and
brothers Jorge and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez.
   Also indicted was Everette Bannister, an associate of Bahamian
Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling, who was charged with receiving
bribes to protect cartel smuggling operations in the island nation.
   The Bahamian government Thursday issued a statement strongly
denying Pindling was in any way linked to drug traffickers.
   ``The legal difficulties (of) ... Bannister, a private Bahamian
citizen, have nothing to do with the government of the Bahamas, its
institutions or its people,'' said Margaret McDonald, the Bahamian
ambassador to the United States.
   Others indicted in the Jacksonville case were alleged pilots,
managers of cocaine operations and distributors of the drug.

   The prosecutor responsible for
convicting reputed cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas says the
powerful Medellin Cartel's days are now numbered, while a defense
lawyer predicts the verdict will be overturned.
   Lehder was convicted Thursday of smuggling more than three tons
of cocaine into the United States. Authorities say the 38-year-old
Colombian was a key figure in the cartel, a violent drug ring
responsible for about 80 percent of U.S. cocaine imports.
   The jury reconvened this morning today to decide whether Ledher
should forfeit his millions of dollars worth of real estate on
Norman's Cay and Nassau in the Bahamas to the U.S. government.
   The flamboyant Lehder, described by witnesses as a one-time New
York City street hood, was characterized by U.S. Attorney Robert W.
Merkle, chief prosecutor in the case, as the most important drug
smuggler brought to trial in the United States.
   The verdict capped a seven-month trial on an 11-count federal
indictment charging him with taking over the island of Norman's Cay
in the Bahamas to smuggle cocaine into Florida and Georgia from
1978 to 1980.
   ``In the immortal words of James Brown, `I feel good,''' said a
jubilant Merkle. ``This is truly a major victory in the war on
drugs,'' he added, saying the verdict would put a crimp in the
Medellin Cartel's operations.
   ``I would say they are looking over their shoulders,'' he said.
``I think their days are numbered.''
   However, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House
narcotics committee, said the conviction will by no means solve
this country's drug problem.
   ``Lehder is not the end of the kingpins of the cartel,'' he said.
   Defense attorney Edward R. Shohat, who presented no witnesses on
Lehder's behalf, said, ``We are of the view that Mr. Lehder will be
vindicated on appeal and that he will receive a new trial ... based
only on the charges in the indictment.''
   The trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115 government
witnesses, along with mounds of documents. Lehder was extradited to
the United States last year after a firefight and his arrest by the
Colombian army at a Medellin mansion.
   When the verdicts were read, he looked down briefly, then stared
straight ahead. Two female jurors cried, one sobbing into her
hands, as their seven days of deliberations ended. Lehder's aunt in
the audience also cried and slumped on a bench.
   Lehder faces a maximum sentence of life plus 150 years in prison
and $350,000 in fines for his convictions on all 11 counts, ranging
from possession of cocaine to running a continuing criminal
enterprise. Merkle said he will recommend life in prison.
   Lehder's co-defendant, Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro,
Calif., was convicted of one conspiracy count and faces a maximum
15-year sentence.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton scheduled sentencing for
July 20.
   According to Internal Revenue Service figures, the drug kingpin
earned an estimated $250 million in the cocaine business.
   Merkle called Lehder the ``Henry Ford of the cocaine trade,''
the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern, high-tech
operation, using airdrops and speed boats. Prosecutors and
government witnesses described Lehder as an admirer of Adolf Hitler
who put together a vast cocaine-smuggling empire after he was
deported to his homeland.
   In Bogota, Colombia, Attorney General Horacio Serpa Uribe said,
``Everyone in Colombia was hoping for a guilty verdict.'' He
declined further comment.
   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III called it ``an excellent
example of international cooperation ... against a major drug
trafficker.''
   Defense lawyer Shohat, who described Lehder as a legitimate
businessman victimized by drug investigators, accused the
government of creating hysteria, convincing jurors their own
security was threatened.
   Lehder ``did not, in my opinion, get a fair trial to which he
was entitled,'' Shohat said.
   Jack Hook, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration,
said the conviction sends a message to other cartel officials that
``you are not able to bribe, intimidate or murder your way out of
custody in the United States.''
   Hook called the cartel the world's largest drug trafficking
ring. By comparison, authorities say the French Connection drug
ring smuggled in about 70 pounds of heroin from 1968 to 1971.
   The principal prosecution witness was Ed Ward, an ex-marine
pilot who ran his own marijuana smuggling operation from Norman's
Cay. He teamed up with Lehder, but eventually fell out with Reed,
he said.
   After his arrest in 1981, Ward began cooperating with the DEA.
He is under federal protection and has been given a new identity.
   Lehder allegedly paid Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling
to look the other way while his smuggling operation took over the
small island of Norman's Cay, a short hop from Florida.
   Pindling, himself reportedly a target of a Florida grand jury
investigation based in part on trial testimony, has called the
allegations a ``fairy tale.''
   The Medellin Cartel has been blamed for a wave of violence
across Colombia, including the assassination of a former justice
minister and the slaying of a top U.S. DEA informant. The trial was
conducted under heavy security.

   Prime Minister Lynden Pindling has survived an avalanche of corruption charges. 
And for years, his political enemies have called for his scalp. 
But how will he fare against the wrath of the islands' bankers? 

   In one of the more curious uprisings in recent Caribbean affairs, many of the usually discreet bankers in this balmy offshore financial center are furious with Mr. Pindling, who handily won re-election last year for a fifth term despite allegations that linked him and his top political allies to drug lords. 
In the past few months, Mr. Pindling doubled fees banks must pay to operate in the Bahamas. 
He publicly accused bankers of being greedy and uninterested in the welfare of the Bahamas. 
And many bankers say Mr. Pindling, who is black, has suggested the white-dominated banking establishment is racist. 

   "Relations between bankers and the government have never been worse," says one foreign banker here. 

   That mightn't seem earthshaking, but in the Bahamas, banking ranks with tourism and drug smuggling as a pillar of what until recently was the Caribbean's most robust economy. 
Bank-secrecy laws and generous tax policies made the islands one of the mainstays of the hot-money circuit; the Bahamas have 385 financial institutions, a bank per-capita ratio of about 1:600. 
They provide thousands of jobs. 

   Moreover, the Bahamian economy is wobbling toward a recession, its first serious dive since Mr. Pindling led the nation to independence from Britain in 1971. 
There's even a minor banking crisis, the first in memory, caused by a liquidity squeeze. 
"This is a time when the banking and public sectors should pull together," says Hubert Ingraham, an opposition member of parliament. 
"Instead, we get all this hot air." 

   The fuss partly reflects the fact bankers have had things their way for so long. 
Many bankers were outraged when Mr. Pindling, who is also minister of finance, doubled the cost of annual licenses for the largest banks to $100,000. 
They can easily afford it, but bankers didn't learn of it until someone spotted it buried in the voluminous government budget issued last fall. 
The central bank apparently wasn't aware of the move; in January it billed the banks at the old rates only to come back for more money weeks later. 

   "My God, you'd think he would at least consult us," one banker says. 
"Many people were affronted." 

   A few weeks ago, Mr. Pindling spoke to 200 bankers at a posh Nassau hotel. 
He ripped into banks for failing to promote Bahamians to top management and not contributing enough to local development. 
The four largest banks, Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays PLC, Bank of Nova Scotia and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, were targeted. 

   "What, apart from making money, has any of them done for the Bahamas or given back to the Bahamas in the last 20 years . . . ?" Mr. Pindling said. 
His reference to "changing the complexion of banking" was read by many as a thinly veiled charge of racism in the upper echelons of banking, which remains largely a preserve of white foreigners. 

   "The bankers felt publicly humiliated," says one diplomat. 
A Pindling proposal that banks finance a theater to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival on the islands fizzled. 
"There isn't much enthusiasm for helping him out at the moment," the diplomat says. 

   Mr. Pindling couldn't be reached for comment, but some bankers trace his bank-bashing to anger over a loan Royal Bank reportedly made to Mr. Pindling's political opponents during the bitter election campaign last summer. 
Royal Bank wouldn't comment, but banking sources say Mr. Pindling was particularly galled by the loan, because Royal Bank for decades has been the government's main bank. 
"It was a dumb move by Royal," one financial executive said. 
"We're all paying for it." 

   All this might be dismissed as quirky Caribbean politics if the Bahamian banking system weren't experiencing a liquidity crunch. 
The origin of the banking crisis isn't clear, but some Bahamians blame a consumer-lending frenzy by foreign banks in the Bahamas last year, in which they tried to utilize the more than $100 million in reserves they built up in 1987, a banner year for tourism and drugs. 
But the banks were badly overextended and the flow of money has slowed this year as tourism and drug trafficking, the latter under U.S. and Bahamian pressure, has dropped off. 

   The result: Almost all the big banks have routinely failed to meet reserve requirements, and credit dried up because the central bank forced the banks to build up liquidity. 
Businesses fear the credit shutdown could lead to a real-estate disaster, as dozens of half-built shopping malls and hotels won't be completed without more financing. 
Economists predict gross national product, which grew at an average 7% for the past several years, may decline 3% or worse. 

   "There's no money," says Ruby Sweeting, an official at the Bahamas Chamber of Commerce. 
"We aren't used to this. 
There's tremendous concern." 

   But others play down the difficulties. 
"Tourism has been here from time immemorial, and it will bounce back," says Frank Davis, a former central bank official who heads Massraf Faysal Al-Islami Bahamas Ltd., a bank with close ties to the Saudi royal family. 
"Those bankers who are unhappy will be happy again. 
There has never been a sea without a ripple."

   A State Department official testified
Tuesday in the cocaine trial of Carlos Lehder Rivas that he tried
to alert the Bahamas' prime minister to illegal activity in the
islands, but was only asked the identity of his sources.
   Andrew F. Antippas, former deputy director the U.S. mission in
Nassau, said he was removed from his post in 1983 after
investigating complaints about the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay.
He is now stationed in South Korea.
   Defense attorneys complained that testimony was going far beyond
the original cocaine-smuggling indictment, and said they were
planning to ask for a mistrial.
   ``The errors that have previously been committed will be grossly
compounded,'' said defense attorney Edward R. Shohat, arguing
against allowing Antippas' testimony.
   ``In clear terms, this is a hydra-headed case,'' said Shohat,
who added that much of the testimony in Lehder's trial has been
outside the scope of the indictment, which covers the period of
1978 to 1980.
   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are on trial
on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into
the United States from Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   ``This indictment has been stressed and mangled so much that is
unrecognizable,'' said Jose Quinon, another defense attorney.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle, the chief prosecutor in the
case, however, argued that Shohat was incorrect.
   ``Mr. Shohat can shout from now to the cows come home ... but it
is not going to make the sun come up in the west,'' said Merkle.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton allowed Antippas to
testify, but limited hearsay testimony.
   Antippas testified he met with Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O.
Pindling in 1981 to discuss written complaints he had received from
Americans living on Norman's Cay.
   ``I raised this with the prime minister and he said he knew of
no such complaints and problems on the island. He asked me who
these people were and I declined to tell him,'' said Antippas.
   He said he also complained to Clement Maynard, home affairs
minister in the Bahamas, and asked that police be stationed on the
island to protect Americans and their property. Maynard agreed.
   In January 1982, Antippas said, he went to the island and found
that police there had no vehicles and were apparently doing nothing.
   He returned in April 1983 and found the island nearly deserted.
He also collected telephone toll records and ledgers from the
island and placed them in the embassy vault in Nassau.
   In December 1982, a new ambassador was appointed for the
Bahamas, Lev Dobriansky, and six months later, Antippas said, the
governor told him to find another job.
   The items he had stored in the vault couldn't be found, he said.
   Gorman Bannister, in earlier testimony, had said his father,
Nassau businessman Everette Bannister, a close associate of
Pindling, had complained that Antippas was a thorn in his side and
vowed to have him removed.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged with only being a member
of the smuggling conspiracy.

   A former drug smuggler testified
Wednesday in the trial of reputed Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos
Lehder Rivas that he had turned down a chance to make more money by
going to work for Lehder.
   Lehder, 37, an alleged leader of Colombia's violent Medellin
cartel, is on trial on charges that he and others smuggled 3.3 tons
of cocaine into the United States from Colombia via Norman's Cay in
the Bahamas from 1978-80.
   William Freeman, 42, former brother-in-law of key prosecution
witness Ed Ward, testified he had joined Ward and others in a
marijuana-smuggling venture from 1975 until 1978.
   But in the summer of 1978, Ward announced he was going to work
for Lehder smuggling cocaine and invited partners in his marijuana
operation to join him.
   ``He didn't think we were making enough money,'' said Freeman.
``I thought he was acting very foolishly.''
   Ward's group was flown to Norman's Cay to discuss the switch,
and Lehder provided a bottle full of cocaine to the guests, Freeman
testified.
   He said he declined to participate because of the violence of
the cocaine business, the legal penalties for being caught and
concerns about the drug itself.
   Ward reportedly told Freeman that Lehder purchased protection in
the Bahamas by paying $200,000 a month, the witness said.
   ``The money was going to Mr. (Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O.)
Pindling through an attorney by the name of Nigel,'' he testified.
   In later arguments, U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle said, ``Nigel
Bowe has been identified as the principal mediator between
narcotics traffickers and Bahamian officials.''
   Earlier, an attorney for Lehder attacked the credibility of
another admitted marijuana smuggler who said he paid bribes to the
prime minister of the Bahamas.
   Prosecution witness George William ``Bill'' Baron had testified
Tuesday that he had paid some $3 million to $5 million over two
years to Pindling.
   Under cross-examination Wednesday, defense attorney Jose Quinon
asked Baron about ``all the things you made up in the courtroom
about Norman's Cay and Mr. Pindling.''
   Quinon also questioned Baron extensively about his testimony
concerning Lehder and two of his men shooting up a Norman's Cay
home after an altercation at the airport.
   Baron had testified that Lehder and his men had sprayed the home
with automatic weapons fire.
   But under questioning, Baron said he couldn't see if any of the
shots hit the house.
   ``All I can tell you is I stood in the driveway and saw them
shoot at the house,'' he said.
   He also said he didn't see any evidence of gunfire when he later
visited the house.
   Lehder is charged in this case with conspiracy, possession of
cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and
operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, is charged with conspiracy.

   Carlos Lehder Rivas, armed with
Colombian contacts and a New York street education, turned a prison
cell fantasy into the world's first high-tech cocaine-smuggling
ring, authorities say.
   At the height of his power in the early 1980s, Lehder was a key
figure in the Medellin cartel, the Colombian drug-trafficking ring
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine brought into this
country, according to U.S. indictments. He was convicted Thursday
on all 11 counts of smuggling lodged against him.
   ``Lehder was one of the four managers for the
multibillion-dollar cartel,'' said Jack Hook, spokesman for the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration in Miami. ``He had hundreds
of millions of dollars pass through his bank accounts in a short
period of time.''
   Lehder owned an island in the Bahamas, gave television
interviews from a Colombian jungle hideaway, showed a fondness for
Adolf Hitler and John Lennon and even organized his own political
party to fight ``U.S. imperialism.''
   In a 1985 interview from the jungle, where he was a fugitive,
Lehder called his nation's stimulants the Achilles' heel of
imperialism.
   ``If coke, coal or marijuana, or gold, or diamonds, or coffee or
whatever we have, is going to provide a cornerstone for us to
remove imperialism from Colombia and Latin America, well then, so
be it,'' he said.
   U.S. authorities kept pressing the Colombian government, and on
Feb. 4, 1987, Lehder was captured for extradition by the Colombian
government after a short firefight outside a Medellin mansion. He
wound up in Jacksonville facing a federal jury.
   Trial testimony, drug agents and prosecutors painted Lehder as a
pioneer in drug trafficking with a grand design to traffic tons of
cocaine through the Bahamas.
   Son of a German father and Colombian mother, Lehder grew up in
Colombia's coffee-growing region of Armenia, then moved to New York
at age 15.
   His brushes with the law began a few years later. In 1974, he
was sentenced to the federal correctional insitution in Danbury,
Conn., for auto theft and marijuana possession.
   Lehder and a prison mate talked about cocaine as the wave of the
future, and pored over an atlas to find a small island they could
buy as a waystation, authorities said.
   After he was deported to Colombia in 1975, Lehder allegedly
began smuggling cocaine into the United States in small amounts,
concealing it in the lining of suitcases.
   Soon he was hiring other ``mules,'' and graduated to using
large, long-range planes to fly several hundred kilograms at a time
out of Colombia.
   Lehder established his base on Norman's Cay, a small Bahamian
island that U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle characterized as ``an
aircraft carrier of cocaine.'' His occupation of the island was
allegedly blessed by Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling
after a series of bribes, according to trial testimony. Pindling
has denied the allegation, and has not been charged.
   Defense attorneys Edward R. Shohat and Jose Quinon contended
Lehder was a businessman who wanted to develop the Bahamian island
as a resort for wealthy Europeans and South Americans. They
introduced into evidence a promotional film made by Lehder which
extolled the island's virtues.
   But according to trial testimony, Lehder soon was flying
shipments from Norman's Cay to small airstrips in Florida and
Georgia.
   ``Carlos Lehder and Henry Ford had a lot in common,'' Merkle
said in his closing arguments. ``Carlos Lehder was the pioneer of
the mass transportation of cocaine for the American consumer.''
   Like many pioneers, money was not Lehder's only objective.
Merkle charged that Lehder also viewed cocaine as a revolutionary
tool.
   Steve Yakovac, who met Lehder in 1976, said Lehder ``wanted to
build a kingdom based on cocaine. ... He pretty much thought he was
going to take on the world.''
   Outside Lehder's Bavarian-style resort of Posada Alemana stands
a symbolically bullet-pocked nude statue of his hero, slain former
Beatle John Lennon.
   At his trial, several witnesses testified that Lehder also
idolized Hitler and kept swastikas, the symbol of Hitler's Nazi
Germany, in his home.
   By 1982, Lehder was spending most of his free time back in
Armenia, developing a resort, buying ranches, starting a newspaper
and forming a political party. He railed against the U.S.-Colombian
extradition treaty, since voided by that nation's supreme court,
calling it an example of U.S. imperialism.
   DEA agents say Lehder was active in the drug-related violence
that swept Colombia, working with guerrilla forces to arrange the
assassination of government officials who opposed the drug trade.
   Lehder's operation began to unravel when Bahamian forces and the
DEA began to focus on Norman's Cay, with the help of marijuana
smuggler Ed Ward, who had joined forces with Lehder in 1978 after
meeting him on the island.

   Carlos Lehder Rivas, reputedly a
leader of a violent Colombian drug cartel responsible for most of
the cocaine imported to this country, was convicted Thursday of
smuggling more than three tons of cocaine into the United States.
   The verdict capped a seven-month trial on a federal indictment
charging him with taking over the island of Norman's Cay in the
Bahamas to smuggle cocaine into Florida and Georgia from 1978 to
1980.
   ``This is truly a major victory in the war on drugs,'' said U.S.
Attorney Robert Merkle, the lead prosecutor.
   Authorities say Lehder, 38, is a key figure in the Medellin
Cartel, responsible for up to 80 percent of U.S. cocaine imports,
and Merkle said the case threatens the cartel's operations.
   ``I would say they are looking over their shoulders,'' Merkle
said. ``I think their days are numbered.''
   But Lehder's attorney, Edward Shohat, said the conviction,
``sadly, means nothing at all.'' He accused the government of
creating hysteria, even convincing jurors their security was
threatened. He promised an appeal.
   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Jack Hook called the
operation the world's largest drug trafficking ring. By comparison,
authorities say the French Connection drug ring smuggled in about
70 pounds of heroin from 1968 to 1971.
   ``This conviction sends a message to the kingpins of the cartel
_ you are not able to bribe, intimdate or muder your way out of
custody in the United States,'' Hook said. ``It has been a
tradition in Colombia, but not in the United States.''
   In Bogota, Colombia, Attorney General Horacio Serpa Uribe said,
``Everyone in Colombia was hoping for a guilty verdict.'' He
declined further comment, saying only, ``I understand that he was
tried in accordance with all the formalities of U.S. law.''
   The verdict was hailed by U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III,
who called it ``an excellent example of international cooperation
... against a major drug trafficker.''
   Lehder could face up to 150 years in prison and $350,000 in
fines for his convictions on all 11 counts, ranging from possession
of cocaine to running a continuing criminal enterprise. His
co-defendant, Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., was
convicted of one conspiracy count and faces a maximum 15-year
sentence.
   Asked if Lehder will spend the rest of his life behind bars,
Merkle said, ``I certainly hope so. That is going to be my
recommendation.''
   When the verdicts were read, Lehder looked down briefly, then
stared straight ahead. Two female jurors cried, one sobbing into
her hands, as their seven days of deliberations ended.
   Lehder's aunt in the audience also cried and slumped down on the
bench.
   Following the verdicts, the jury had to consider government
motions seeking the forfeiture of millions of dollars of Lehder's
property in the Bahamas, including land, homes, an airstrip and
planes.
   The seven-month trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115
government witnesses, along with mounds of documents. Lehder was
extradited to the United States last year following a firefight and
his arrest by the Colombian army at a Medellin mansion.
   During the trial Merkle called Lehder the Henry Ford of drug
trafficking, the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern,
high-tech operation, using airdrops and speed boats.
   Prosecutors and government witnesses described Lehder as a
one-time New York street hood who put together a vast
cocaine-smuggling empire after he was deported to his homeland,
becoming a key figure in the Colombia-based Medellin cartel.
   The cartel has been blamed for a wave of violence across
Colombia, including the assassination of a former justice minister
and the slaying of top U.S. DEA informant Adler ``Barry'' Seal in
Baton Rouge, La. Up to 10 armed marshals were visible in court
during Lehder's trial.
   Witnesses talked of his flamboyant personality, which included
admiration for Adolf Hitler and slain former Beatle John Lennon.
   They said Lehder, after initially smuggling the drug himself and
paying ``mules'' to fly between Colombia and the United States,
earned a stake that allowed him to fly his own shipments.
   He allegedly paid off Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling
to look the other way while his smuggling operation took over the
small island of Norman's Cay, a short hop from Florida.
   Pindling, himself reportedly a target of a Florida grand jury
investigation based in part on trial testimony, has called the
allegations a ``fairy tale.''
   The principal prosecution witness was Ed Ward, an ex-marine
pilot running his own marijuana smuggling operation from the
island. He teamed up with Lehder, but eventually fell out with
Reed, Lehder's co-defendant, he said.
   After his arrest in 1981, Ward began cooperating with the DEA.
   Ward, who is under federal protection and has been given a new
identity, testified about hauling 1,600 kilograms of cocaine from
Colombia to Norman's Cay, and flying tons of cocaine from the
Bahamian island to airstrips in Florida and Georgia.
   Defense attorneys Shohat and Jose Quinon hammered away at the
credibility of Ward and other prosecution witnesses. They accused
them of making deals to avoid punishment for their own crimes, and
said Lehder was a legitimate businessman victimized by drug
investigators.
   The prosecution testimony was a ``litany of lies,'' Shohat said.
   In a surprise move, they presented no witnesses after the
prosecution rested, sending the trial immediately to the jury.
   Lehder is also under indictment in Miami for his role in the
Medellin cartel. But that indictment was not included in his
extradition papers, and under the U.S.-Colombia treaty in effect at
the time, he apparently cannot be tried on the charges. Lehder also
is reportedly the object of a sealed indictment in Los Angeles.

   Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling broke
his silence Wednesday to deny taking bribes from drug smugglers as
claimed at the trial of reputed cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas.
   ``I have never been offered a bribe and have never accepted a
bribe,'' he said in a statement released to The Associated Press by
Ken Heinrich, Miami bureau chief of Bahamas News Bureau, a
government news agency.
   Pindling's government had repeatedly said it would not comment
on allegations made at Lehder's trial until it was over. The
defense rested Monday without calling any witnesses.
   Several witnesses at the Jacksonville trial, which is expected
to go to the jury next week after six months of testimony, have
charged Pindling filled his pockets with money from smugglers such
as Lehder, who allegedly used Norman's Cay in the Bahamas as a
transfer point for Colombian cocaine bound for Florida and Georgia.
   George William ``Bill'' Baron, 42, a marijuana smuggler,
testified in February about paying $3 million to $5 million in
bribes to Pindling. Baron also testified Lehder was paying Pindling
a flat $200,000 a month.
   ``George Baron, in accepting what he believed was an open
invitation to perjure himself in plea bargaining, told a story
about me that is patently false and a complete fabrication, which
can easily be shown to be such by even a casual observation of the
alleged facts and the circumstances he described,'' the Pindling
statement said.
   According to recent news reports, grand juries in Jacksonville,
Tampa and Miami are looking into Pindling's affairs. U.S. Attorney
Robert Merkle, whose district includes Jacksonville and Tampa, has
refused comment on the claim.
   ``I would be surprised, however, if anything came out of those
investigations,'' Pindling said. ``This is so because the testimony
given concerning me is totally and absolutely untrue.''
   Pindling's name has frequently been tied to drug investigations.
In 1984, a royal commission of inquiry in the Bahamas found that
Pindling had more money than known income, but that none of that
appeared to be drug-related.
   Pindling won re-election a year ago, invoking the fear common to
small nations in the Western hemisphere that the United States is
meddling in their affairs.
   Lehder has been charged with smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine from
Colombia via Norman's Cay to the United States from 1978 to 1980.
He is accused of being a leader of the Medellin cartel, believed
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into United
States.

<HEAD>Fugitive Financier Vesco Added To Cocaine-Conspiracy Indictment</HEAD>

   Fugitive financier Robert Vesco was
added Monday as a defendant in a drug-conspiracy indictment,
accused of persuading his Cuban hosts to allow cocaine-laden
airplanes to fly over Cuba en route to the Bahamas.
   Vesco, a fugitive since the Nixon administration, was indicted
on one count alleging he conspired to import cocaine into the
United States.
   Vesco is believed to have lived in Cuba since 1982, after
bouncing around the Bahamas, the Caribbean and Costa Rica. He has
been wanted in the United States since 1973 on charges of looting
an investment firm, Investors Overseas Services, of $224 million.
   The federal indictment charged that in October 1984, Colombian
cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas sent a messenger from Nicaragua
to Cuba asking Vesco to use his influence in Cuba to arrange for
Lehder's aircraft to fly over Cuba on smuggling runs from Nicaragua
to Andros Island in the Bahamas.
   A few days later, Vesco, ``in the presence of another
individual'' supplied Lehder's messenger with a document approving
the cocaine overflights. The other person was not identified in the
indictment.
   The United States and Cuba don't have normal diplomatic
relations or an extradition agreement. The Cuban government has
denied playing host to Vesco.
   Vesco's name was added as 15 other defendants, including
Lehder's former wife, faced arraignment in federal court in what
prosecutors call the ``son of Lehder'' cocaine-conspiracy case.
   Lehder is believed to be one of the architects of the Medellin
cartel, a Colombian drug-smuggling organization that is blamed for
80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   Lehder, 39, was convicted in May in Jacksonville of cocaine
smuggling and operating a continuing criminal enterprise and is
serving a life sentence plus 135 years in federal prison in Marion,
Ill.
   Most of those charged in the latest indictment, unsealed in
March, were mentioned in testimony during Lehder's trial.
   In addition, key members of the Medellin cartel also were
indicted, as well as Everette Bannister, a Nassau businessman and
close associate of Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling.
   Bannister and the reputed leaders of the cartel _ Pablo Escobar
Gaviria, Jose Gonzalo Rodriquez Gacha, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez, Fabi
Ochoa Vasquez and Gonzalo Mejia _ remained at large Monday.
   But 15 co-defendents, most of whom were freed on bail after
their arrests in March, were ordered to appear before U.S.
Magistrate Harvey Schlesinger. They included Yemel Nacel, who was
once married to Lehder.
   All 15 are accused of playing relatively minor roles in the drug
dealing, some of which occurred as long as a decade ago.
   Ms. Nacel, who now lives in New York City, is accused only of
helping count some of Lehder's money in 1978 in Beverly Hills,
Calif.
   Also facing new charges is Jack Carlton Reed, the co-defendant
in Lehder's trial who is serving a 15-year prison sentence. Reed
faces a possible life sentence if convicted of operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller, who along with former
U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle prosecuted Lehder, said he expects
to face strenuous defense arguments, including the statute of
limitations and duration of the alleged conspiracy from 1974 to
1989.

   Carlos Lehder Rivas, the biggest
foreign drug dealer ever brought to trial in this country, was
found guilty today of running a smuggling operation that shipped
tons of cocaine from Colombia to the United States.
   The verdict against the reputed leader of Colombia's violent
Medellin drug cartel came just after 11 a.m. following seven days
of deliberation.
   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, were
convicted of conspiring to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine, by way of
Norman's Cay in the Bahamas, from 1978 to 1980.
   Prosecutors and government witnesses had described Lehder as a
one-time New York street hood who put together a vast
cocaine-smuggling empire after he was deported to his homeland.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle called him the Henry Ford of drug
trafficking, pioneering mass shipments of cocaine by air from
Colombia to the United States.
   At a news conference this afternoon, Merkle called the verdict
``a victory for the good guys.''
   Asked whether Lehder would spend the rest of his life in jail,
Merkle said: ``I certainly hope so. ... That is certainly going to
be my recommendation.''
   Lehder was found guilty on all counts: one count of conspiracy,
two of importation of cocaine, seven of possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute and one of engaging in a continuing criminal
enterprise.
   He looked down, then stared straight ahead as the court clerk
read the verdicts. Two jurors cried, with one sobbing and burying
her face in her hands, as the seven-month trial came to an end.
   Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., was convicted on a single conspiracy
count and faces up to 15 years in prison and $25,000 in fines.
Lehder now faces life plus 150 years in prison and up to $350,000
in fines.
   Following the verdict on the charges, the jury had to consider
whether Lehder should be forced to forfeit all his Bahamian
property, including large parts of Norman's Cay, several homes, an
airstrip and possibly a number of planes, to the U.S. government.
   The jury returned to deliberations after a brief hearing, and
attorneys both sides refused immediate comment. ``If it's any good,
it's worth waiting for,'' Merkle quipped when asked for reaction to
the verdict.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, commenting to reporters
outside Justice Department today, cited a ``fine job'' by the
prosecutor and investigating agents and said the case was ``an
excellent example of international cooperation ... against a major
drug trafficker.''
   Authorities said the Medellin Cartel, named for a city in
Colombia, was believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the
cocaine smuggled into the United States. Prosecutors called Lehder
the biggest foreign drug smuggler ever brought to trial in the
United States.
   Jurors' names have not been revealed for security reasons, and
U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton had the foreman sign the
verdict form only with his number.
   When Lehder was first brought to the Jacksonville federal
courthouse, a small army of police armed with shotguns and
automatic weapons surrounded the building. Security eased during
the trial, but each day up to 10 federal marshals were in the
courtroom.
   During the trial, witnesses told of Lehder's flamboyant
personality, which included admiration for both Adolf Hitler and
former Beatle John Lennon.
   Witnesses said Lehder, after initially smuggling the drug
himself and paying ``mules'' to fly between Colombia and the United
States, earned a stake that allowed him to fly his own shipments.
   Lehder allegedly paid off Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O.
Pindling to look the other way while his smuggling operation took
over the small island of Norman's Cay, a short hop from Florida.
   Pindling, himself reportedly a target of a Florida grand jury
investigation based in part on trial testimony, has called the
charges a ``fairy tale.''
   The principal prosecution witness was Ed Ward, an ex-marine
pilot running his own marijuana smuggling operation from the
island. He teamed up with Lehder, but eventually fell out with
Lehder's co-defendant Reed, he said.
   After he was arrested in early 1981, he began cooperating with
the DEA.
   Ward, who is under federal protection and has been given a new
identity, testified about hauling 1,600 kilograms of cocaine from
Colombia o Norman's Cay, and flying tons of cocaine from the
Bahamian island to airstrips in Florida and Georgia.
   The trial included a brief appearance by former CBS News anchor
Walter Cronkite, who testified about being chased away from
Norman's Cay in 1978 when he tried to anchor there. ``I was the
most naive yachtsman in the Bahamas,'' he said.
   Defense attorneys Edward Shohat and Jose Quinon hammered away at
the credibility of Ward and other prosecution witnesses. They
accused them of making deals to avoid punishment for their own
crimes, and said Lehder was a legitimate businessman being
victimized by drug investigators.
   In a surprise move, they presented no defense witnesses after
the prosecution rested, sending the trial immediately to the jury.
   Lehder was captured by the Colombian army on Feb. 4, 1987, after
a firefight outside a Medellin mansion. He was immediately flown to
Florida in a swift extradition move that caused controversy in
Colombia.
   A day before bringing in the verdict, the jury had reviewed a
videotape made by Lehder in 1985 when he was a fugitive in the
jungles of Colombia.
   ``This is about political action and cocaine has become, and
marijuana has become, a revolutionary weapon in the struggle
against North American imperialism. Stimulants from Colombia are
the Achilles' heel of imperialism,'' Lehder said.
   Merkle accused Lehder of threatening to kill federal judges if
he were extradited. Lehder's attorneys denied that, but the violent
history of the Medellin Cartel made authorities cautious.
   Hundreds of Colombian officials have been murdered by drug lords
connected to the cartel, including Justice Minister Rodrigo
Lara-Bonilla. The cartel also had a hand in the Louisiana slaying
of Adler ``Barry'' Seal, a top U.S. drug informant, according to
the Miami indictment.
   Lehder is also named in the Miami indictment for his role in the
Medellin Cartel. But that indictment was not included in his
extradition papers, and under the U.S.-Colombia treaty in effect at
the time, he apparently cannot be tried on the charges.
   Lehder also is reportedly the object of a sealed indictment in
Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
   Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling
says former U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle knowingly used false
testimony in a criminal probe involving allegations that Pindling
had accepted bribes from drug traffickers.
   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller declined comment
Thursday on Pindling's accusations, contained in a letter the
Bahamian government said was delivered to U.S. Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh. It calls for appointment of a special prosecutor
to investigate Merkle, the former U.S. attorney in Tampa, Fla., for
prosecutorial misconduct.
   A three-page statement describing the letter was made available
to the news media by the Bahamian embassy in Washington.
   The letter by an attorney for Pindling, Ira Dement, says Merkle
``used perjured evidence, knowing it to be false or not caring
whether it was true or untrue, seeming for political gain.'' Merkle
was defeated in a Florida primary election earlier this month in a
bid for a U.S. Senate seat.
   Convicted drug smuggler George William Baron testified under
questioning by Merkle earlier this year at the trial of Colombian
drug dealer Carlos Lehder that in 1980, he paid Pindling $400,000
in cash in a Paradise Island casino in the presence of Lady
Pindling, Tourism Minister Clement Maynard, Mrs. Maynard and many
others. Merkle opened a grand jury probe of Pindling.
   Dement said testimony by Baron and Gorman Bannister alleging
official complicity in drug smuggling was easily refutable, but
that Merkle made no effort to check out their stories. In May 1988,
Merkle was advised by Pindling's personal attorney, F. Lee Bailey,
that Bannister and Baron were lying, said Dement.
   Bailey offered Merkle the full cooperation of the prime
minister, said Dement, who added that Bailey is prepared to testify
that Merkle ``promised an expeditious conclusion'' of his probe.
Merkle used Baron's groundless recitation again, only a month
later, in the trial of Robert Castoro without making an effort to
verify his testimony, said Dement.
   The statement made available to the news media said Dement sent
Thornburgh documentation showing that the Pindlings were in Africa
when the payoff allegedly was made. Dement said the prime minister
and Deputy Prime Minister Clement Maynard have indicated they are
willing to cooperate in an investigation of the allegations of
Banister and Baron and the lack of effort by Merkle to review the
evidence of that falsity.
   In an interview in Thursday editions of the New York Times,
Merkle was quoted as saying that ``Sir Lynden is full of hot air''
and that his investigation was handled in accord with Justice
Department rules.

   Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling is
being investigated by two U.S. grand juries probing payoffs by drug
traffickers, The Washington Times reported today.
   The newspaper, quoting sources it did not identify, said grand
juries in Miami and Jacksonville, Fla., have heard testimony from
witnesses who claim Pindling received payments from cocaine
traffickers to ensure safe passage of the drug through the Bahamas.
   Pindling, in an interview with the Times, denied the allegation.
He said the Bahamian government has been working for years to stem
the flow of illegal drugs.
   ``The allegations against me are not true,'' he said. ``I would
hate to think that anyone truly believes I am a crook.''
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Miami did not
return telephone inquiries Wednesday about the case, the newspaper
said, while a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office in
Jacksonville declined to comment.
   The Times said documents it had inspected indicated that,
between January 1977 and December 1983, Pindling deposited into his
personal banks accounts $3.5 million over his official income as
prime minister.
   However, it also said two out of three commissioners on a panel
named in the Bahamas in 1984 to investigate allegations against
Pindling found ``no credible evidence'' linking him to drug-related
corruption.

SMUGGLING: JAMAICA AND THE BAHAMAS SEEK TO DRAW ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE U.S.

After more than a decade as the main strategic battlefront in the U.S. war on 
drugs, the mini-states of the Caribbean, led by Jamaica and the Bahamas, have 
opened a campaign to draw the United Nations into an active anti-drug combat 
role. 
</P>
<P>
The aim is to ease sensitivities over too great an American presence in 
drug-troubled countries such as Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ministers Michael Manley of Jamaica and Lynden O. Pindling of the Bahamas 
have called for a rapid U.N. deployment force that would interdict drug 
shipments, eradicate drug crops, ferret out anti-narcotics intelligence and 
even mount paramilitary-style raids against drug traffickers -- the way U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration, Coast Guard and military units try to do in 
cooperating countries. 
</P>
<P>
The force would be similar to U.N. peacekeeping forces that have been deployed 
in many of the world's hot spots, according to the two prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the unanimous support of the Caribbean Community and Common Market, 
made up of the English-speaking countries of the region, the two last week 
sought broader support at the annual meeting of the British Commonwealth 
nations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
Pindling said in a recent interview that he will also lobby for support at a 
summit of 15 regional heads of state, including President Bush, scheduled to be 
held in Costa Rica on Friday and Saturday. And he said he will press for 
adoption of the scheme at a special U.N. General Assembly meeting on drugs due 
to convene sometime before next February. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pindling, the multinational force could be formed and in action 
within six months if major powers such as the United States get behind the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are serious, we could pass the resolution at the U.N. this year," 
Pindling said. ". . . If they're serious about a narcotics eradication program, 
they could put it together in three months and have it operational in six. It 
all depends on how serious those countries which have the capability are." 
</P>
<P>
Because both countries now cooperate closely with American anti-narcotics 
forces, U.S. officials are reluctant to muddy relations by publicly criticizing 
the Manley-Pindling scheme. But some U.S. veterans of the Caribbean front of 
the drug war expressed deep reservations and cautioned that even if an armed 
U.N. force is formed, it would be incredibly expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"We would probably have to bankroll it, and we wouldn't get as much bang for 
the buck as we get now in bilateral programs such as our joint operations in 
the Bahamas," one official said. "The Bahamas operation alone costs $30 million 
to $40 million annually. I'm not sure there's enough jam to cover all that 
bread." 
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. specialist dismissed the Bahamian prime minister's support of the 
U.N. proposal as little more than an attempt to scrub up an unsavory image 
imprinted on the Bahamas government by U.S. indictments of several close 
Pindling associates on drug-related charges. "He wants to be seen as part of 
the solution to the drug crisis rather than as part of the problem," the 
specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
But another American drug expert said the idea is a good one, regardless of 
Pindling's motives, because it would make outside assistance more acceptable to 
politically sensitive Latin nations. 
</P>
<P>
"A U.N. helicopter squadron would help immeasurably in some places," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pindling acknowledged that the idea of forming an armed U.N. force to conduct 
aggressive military operations against the drug barons might be hard to sell to 
the international organization, which has deployed troops only for peacekeeping 
purposes since the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
"But if it's not possible to have that kind of (armed) force, at least it may 
be able to take part in the eradication of drug-producing centers and crops," 
he said. "It might be easier to deal with that rather than with 
street-to-street, house-to-house law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Pindling said he envisages a narcotics enforcement support office at the United 
Nations with high-tech intelligence capabilities, such as satellite 
surveillance aimed at pinpointing drug crops and cocaine factories, as well as 
international financial specialists with the power to track down drug 
traffickers and their financial networks. 
</P>
<P>
The task is urgent, Pindling declared. 
</P>
<P>
"It's made even more urgent by what is happening now in Colombia," he said. 
"How long will it take before Colombia self-destructs? Before the whole economy 
is shattered? And if it progresses to Bolivia and Peru, it may lead them to 
similar self-destruction. We just can't devastate three countries like that. 
They need help. We need help. It's urgent."

   Seven people, including a sitting member of the
Bahamian parliament and a highly visible Boston defense attorney,
have been indicted on charges they schemed to launder illegal drug
profits, the government announced Wednesday.
   The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury a week ago and
unsealed Wednesday, centers around the activities of reputed drug
mogul Salvatore M. Caruana, according to acting U.S. Attorney
Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan.
   It charges that Caruana made $7.5 million selling marijuana,
then conspired with the other six defendants to invest and launder
the money using ``front'' companies in the Bahamas, Panama and the
United States.
   Caruana He is charged with racketeering and, along with the
other six defendants, conspiring to defraud the IRS.
   The others include Kendal W. Nottage, a member of the Bahamian
Parliament and a former cabinet minister to Bahamian Prime Minister
Lynden Pindling, and prominent Boston attorney Joseph J. Balliro.
   Caruana has been a fugitive on the government's most wanted list
since 1984, when he jumped bail after being indicted for allegedly
smuggling $173 million of mariujana into New England.
   Nottage, 48, who is an attorney, was charged with conspiring to
defraud the U.S. government.
   The indictment accuses Nottage of transporting large sums of
money to the Bahamas for Caruana and executing a false document
that concealed Caruana's interest in the island's Islander Hotel,
which was used to launder the money.
   Nottage's wife, Rubie, 45, also an attorney in Nassau, was one
of four people charged with conspiring to violate federal
racketeering laws.
   Both Nottages are accused of lying about Caruana and their
activities on his behalf to a special commission appointed by the
Bahamian government to investigate drug trafficking there.
   The couple released a statement Wednesday maintaining their
innocence. They said Kendal Nottage simply negotiated a loan to pay
off a mortgage on the hotel he had owned and occupied since 1976,
before he became a cabinet minister. No money was sent to the
Bahamas because the lenders and mortgage holders were in the Boston
area and the loan was arranged by attorneys who did not disclose
the lender's identity, the statement said.
   ``To our knowledge, neither Kendal nor I have broken any law in
the United States or at home here in the Bahamas,'' the statement
said.
   The Nottages have previously stated their innocence and called
the indictment, which has been expected, a political move by the
United States to smear the Bahamas as a drug laundering center.
   A Bahamian with close ties to Pindling was one of 30 people
indicted last week by a federal grand jury in Jacksonville, Fla.,
for allegedly taking bribes to allow Columbia's Medellin Cartel to
use the Bahamas as a way station for drug shipments.
   O'Sullivan said the two cases were unconnected.
   He said the Caruana case also was unrelated to indictments
announced in Washington in what federal officials called
``Operation Polar Cap,'' a crackdown on an alleged billion-dollar
international drug laundering operation.
   The Boston indictment accuses Balliro, 61, and another Boston
attorney, Edmund M. Hurley, 54, of Brookline, of racketeering and
income tax violations.
   Balliro has represented a convicted Mafia defendant on
conspiracy to defraud the IRS. Hurley has represented Caruana on
civil matters.
   Last week, Balliro held a news conference to deny any wrongdoing
and called the charges a personal attack by O'Sullivan. Balliro
demanded a special prosecutor be appointed in the case.
   O'Sullivan called Balliro's claim that the charges resulted from
personal animosity between himself and the lawyer ``a figment of
Mr. Balliro's imagination.''
   The interim U.S. attorney, who will step down from his post
Friday, said he took the unusual step of having the entire two-year
investigation and the indictments reviewed by two independent
sections of the Justice Department.
   O'Sullivan said his superiors found no need to appoint a special
prosecutor.
   Also indicted were David T. Gorwitz, 58, also a fugitive, and
Charles R. Burnett, age 47, a Pompano Beach, Fla., attorney.
   O'Sullivan said the State Department had received help from the
Bahamian Commission of Inquiry, had notified the Bahamian
government of the indictments and would ask that the Nottages be
extradited.
   But in a statement released Wednesday evening, the Bahamian
government said the United States had not supplied any evidence
that couple had violated any laws or provided any details of the
indictment.
   The statement called the indictment an ``attempt to extend
United States' legal jurisdiction beyond its shores into the
sovereign territory of an independent nation.''
   The Bahamian government also questioned the timi of the
indictment, which comesth before Congress is to consider
certifying the Bahamas as a cooperating country in the fight
against drug trafficking.

   A federal judge Wednesday sentenced
convicted Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas to a
maximum life sentence without parole plus 135 years as a sign of
society's determination to expunge ``this cancer.''
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton brushed aside Lehder's
contention that he was a political prisoner.
   Lehder, who prosecutors called a key figure in the Medellin
Cartel drug ring said to be responsible for 80 percent of the
Colombian cocaine coming into the United States, was convicted in
May of importing 3.3 tons of cocaine into the country from his
island smuggling headquarters in the Bahamas.
   Melton imposed the harshest penalty possible under federal law
over defense objections that it exceeded the maximum allowable
under the U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty.
   The sentence is ``a message .. a signal to our society that it
will do everything it can to rid itself of this cancer,'' Melton
said.
   During a 25-minute speech to the court prior to the sentencing,
Lehder portrayed himself as a victim of the political ambitions of
U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, now a candidate for the Republican
nomination for Florida's U.S. Senate seat.
   ``I have been Mr. Merkle's hostage,'' said Lehder. ``I'm a
political prisoner. My arrest is illegal.''
   He said he had been ``kidnapped'' and illegally brought to this
country because he had been a political leader in Colombia, working
to overthrow the U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty.
   He was a victim of ``mistreatment and harassment ... and
psychological torture ordered by Mr. Merkle,'' Lehder said in
slightly accented English.
   But Melton, who earlier Wednesday sentenced Lehder's
co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed to 15 years in prison, said politics
was not at the root of the case.
   ``You were not convicted because of your political beliefs,
because you are a Colombian,'' the judge said. ``The truth of the
matter is (the smuggling) was done for money ... greed.''
   Prosecutors had asked for life without parole on the charge of
running a continuing criminal enterprise, plus 15 years each of 10
drug-smuggling charges. But under the law one drug-smuggling charge
had to be concurrent with the life sentence, leading to the
135-year total.
   Lehder will also have to pay $350,000 in fines. Reed was fined
$25,000 for his conviction on a single count of conspiracy to
import cocaine.
   Merkle's replacement, U.S. Attorney Joe Magri, who attended the
sentencing as a spectator, called Lehder ``a cocaine
narco-terrorist'' and applauded the sentence.
   ``The judge fairly, justly and appropriately socked it to a
hoodlum,'' said Magri. The sentence ``sends a clear message that
we're serious about stopping narcotics traffic.''
   Lehder, 38, one of the leaders of the violent Medellin Cartel
was convicted May 19 of smuggling Colombian cocaine into the United
States through the Bahamas.
   Defense attorneys Edward Shohat and Jose Quinon had asked the
judge to impose a 20-year sentence at most, which they said would
be four times longer than the terms being served by the former
smugglers who turned against Lehder and testified for the
government.
   After listening to almost four hours of arguments and objections
from Lehder's attorneys to pre-sentence reports, Melton told the
defendant that the government had presented ``monumental amounts of
incriminating evidence against you.''
   Reciting the lengthy list of convictions, the judge said they
did not adequately portray ``the evidence of your crimes.''
   Testimony in the seven-month trial included allegations that
Bahamian officials, including Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling,
helped Lehder and his smuggling organization run more than 20 tons
of cocaine from Colombia through Norman's Cay into deserted
airstrips in Florida and Georgia.
   Pindling and his aides have repeatedly denied the allegations.
   Lehder was extradited to the United States last year following a
gun battle and his arrest by the Colombian army at a plush mansion
in Medellin.
   He also is under indictment in Miami for his role in the cartel,
and there is a sealed indictment against him in Los Angeles. But
officials have said it is highly unlikely that he will be tried on
those charges.
   Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., a pilot in the drug-smuggling
ring, stood silently as he was sentenced. Government witnesses had
testified that he had made at least seven flights from the Bahamas
to ferry 2,500 pounds of cocaine into airports in Florida and
Georgia.

   Five Americans accused of helping the
Medellin cartel smuggle cocaine into the United States went on trial
today, while the big names _ the ring's reputed Colombian
masterminds _ remained at large.
   The trial has been dubbed the ``Son of Lehder'' case because it
is a spinoff of the smuggling trial last year of Carlos Lehder
Rivas, a Colombian boss of the cartel.
   Among those indicted but missing from the trial were reputed
cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jose Gonzalo Rodriquez Gacha,
Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez. They are on the U.S.
list of most-wanted drug barons.
   Others indicted but not here to face charges are U.S. financier
Robert Vesco, who lives in Cuba, and Everette Bannister, an
associate of Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling.
   Jury selection began with U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II
questioning the first of 65 prospective jurors about how much they
knew about the Lehder case.
   In that trial, which lasted 7{ months before Lehder was
convicted, witnesses implicated others in a conspiracy that the
government said began in 1974 and continued until this year.
   Lehder, 40, believed to have been one of the leaders and
architects of the Medellin cartel, was convicted of operating a
continuing criminal enterprise and was sentenced to life in prison
without parole. He is in isolation at the federal prison in Marion,
Ill.
   The five defendants on trial here are accused of helping the
cartel in one way or another over the past 15 years.
   Lehder was convicted of operating a cocaine-smuggling operation
that used the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay as an ``aircraft
carrier'' to fly 20 tons of cocaine into the United States from
Colombia from 1978 to 1981.
   The indictment charges that in October 1984, Lehder sent a
messenger from Nicaragua to Cuba asking Vesco to use his influence
in Cuba to arrange for Lehder's aircraft to fly over Cuba on
smuggling runs from Nicaragua to Andros Island in the Bahamas.
   A few days later, Vesco supplied Lehder's messenger with a
document approving the cocaine overflights.
   Vesco, who was indicted on one count alleging he conspired to
import cocaine, is believed to have lived in Cuba since 1982. He has
been wanted in the United States since 1973 on charges of looting an
investment firm of $224 million.
   Also at large was Bannister, a Nassau resident accused of taking
money from the cartel to allow the Bahamas to be used as a way
station for drug imports.
   Facing trial today are Jack Carlton Reed, 58, who was convicted
with Lehder on one conspiracy count and sentenced to 15 years in
prison; Thomas Howard Herington, 35, of Mill Valley, Calif.;
attorney Barry Kane, 52, of Hyannis, Mass., and Fort Lauderdale;
Donald Kenneth Lady, 41, of Pomona, Calif.; and Samuel Thomas
Stewart, 53, of Anaheim, Calif.
   If convicted, they could be sentenced to prison terms of 10 years
to life.
   Lehder's former wife, Yemel Nacel, 34, of New York City, and nine
others have pleaded guilty to conspiracy and are among the 98 people
on the government's witness list.
   Prosecutors expected the trial to last two months.
   The Medellin cartel is described as the world's largest illegal
cocaine operation. It is believed to supply 80 percent of the
cocaine sold in the United States.
   In Atlanta today, Eduardo Martinez Romero, the Colombian who
federal officials say helped the cartel launder $1.2 billion in drug
profits, pleaded innocent to fraud and money-laundering charges in
federal court.

  [Excerpts] Nassau, Bahamas, 26 Jan, Cana -- Twenty per 
cent of shareholding in the state-owned Bank of Bahamas will be 
offered to the public later this year, Prime Minister Hubert 
Ingraham has announced. 
  He said the government's ownership of a commercial bank is 
against the policy of the ruling Free National Movement 
administration. 
  Ingraham, in a recent address to the Bankers Association of 
the Bahamas, also warned of the United States' efforts to try to 
"close down" and put pressure on international banking 
businesses in small countries. 
  He said the Bahamas must continue to maintain a good banking 
reputation so "we can look at them (United States) and say we 
are operating a clean banking system". 
  The Bahamas must also continue to be able to say that it 
does 
not facilitate drug trafficking and criminal money, and that the 
banks in the Bahamas have a code of conduct that is enforced, 
said Ingraham. 
  He said government will undertake a close examination of the 
banking sector to determine ways of improving its 
competitiveness. [passage omitted] 
  The Bank of the Bahamas, a 100 per cent government-owned 
entity, is being operated without government involvement in its 
management and is competing effectively in the private sector, 
he said. 
  Ingraham said government's continuing ownership of a 
commercial bank is consistent with its policy - leave business 
to business persons. 
  "Later in the year, we will begin the government's 
divestment 
programme by offering to the Bahamian public 20 per cent of the 
shares of the Bank of the Bahamas. 
  "The state's disengagement, however, will take due account 
of 
relevant factors including employment," said Ingraham. 
  The importance of the banking sector to the Bahamian economy 
is underscored by its estimated contribution to gross national 
product and employment opportunities. 
  In 1992, the banking industry employed almost 3 400 persons 
and had direct expenditure of almost 200 million dollars. 
  Ingraham said government was keen, not simply to maintain 
the 
Bahamas' position as the leader in the offshore banking 
community, but on regaining any of the ground lost to 
competitors. 
  As technology changes and as other financial centres improve 
their products and financial markets, the Bahamas will continue 
to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness in banking in the 
Bahamas, he said. 
  "We are making additional investment to ensure that we have 
the most sophisticated, state of the art telecommunications 
systems and that our regulatory framework remains appropriate to 
the business we are doing," said Ingraham. 
  As a result, the Bahamas is reviewing its telecommunication 
charges in comparision with other international financial 
centres so that it might ensure that it is technologically cost 
competitive and attractive to international business. 
  "The role played by human resource development in promoting 
the efficiency of our offshore centre, and in ensuring a more 
balanced distribution of economic and social progress cannot be 
over emphasised," Ingraham said. 
  "The government will place even greater emphasis on 
upgrading 
the skills of our work force through well defined training and 
retraining programmes which will take account of the dynamics of 
the marketplace," he said.

   The trial of several Americans accused
of helping a Colombian cocaine cartel opened Monday with a judge
questioning potential jurors on their knowledge of the trial here
last year of convicted drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas.
   The case grew out of testimony from Lehder's cocaine-smuggling
trial, which lasted 7{ months and saw witnesses implicate others in
a conspiracy the government says began in 1974 and continued until
this year.
   Lehder, the Medellin cartel participant who was extradited from
Colombia, was convicted of smuggling tons of cocaine into the United
States.
   The Medellin cartel, named for the Colombian city where it is
based, is considered the world's largest illegal cocaine operation
and is believed to supply 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the
United States.
   Many of the best-known leaders of Colombian cocaine cartels are
defendants in the trial, but are still at large.
   Facing trial are Jack Carlton Reed, 58, who was convicted with
Lehder on one conspiracy count and sentenced to 15 years in prison;
Thomas Howard Herington, 35, of Mill Valley, Calif.; attorney Barry
Kane, 52, of Hyannis, Mass., and Fort Lauderdale; Donald Kenneth
Lady, 41, of Pomona, Calif., and Samuel Thomas Stewart, 53, of
Anaheim, Calif.
   If convicted, they could be sentenced to prison terms of 10 years
to life.
   Absent defendants include cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria,
Jose Gonzalo Rodriquez Gacha, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa
Vasquez. They are on the list of the government's most-wanted
Colombian drug kingpins and remain at large in Colombia.
   Others indicted but not present are financier Robert Vesco, who
lives in Cuba, and Everette Bannister, an associate of Bahamian
Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling. U.S. officials have
unsuccessfully sought Bannister's extradition.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II began the jury-selection
process by questioning the prospective jurors about their knowledge
of Lehder's trial and whether they had read anything about this case.
   Lehder, 40, believed to have been one of the leaders and
architects of the Medellin cartel, was convicted in May 1988 of
operating a continuing criminal enterprise and was sentenced to life
in prison without the possibility of parole. He is being held in
isolation at the federal prison in Marion, Ill. He allegedly flew 20
tons of cocaine into the United States from 1978 to 1981.
   The indictment in this case charges that in October 1984, Lehder
sent a messenger from Nicaragua to Cuba asking Vesco to use his
influence in Cuba to arrange for Lehder's aircraft to fly over Cuba
on smuggling runs from Nicaragua to the Bahamas.
   A few days later, Vesco allegedly supplied Lehder's messenger

   Vesco, indicted on one count alleging he conspired to import
cocaine, is believed to have lived in Cuba since 1982. He has been
wanted in the United States since 1973 on charges of looting an
investment firm of $224 million.
   Bannister, a resident of Nassau, the Bahamas, is accused of
taking money from the cartel to allow the Bahamas to be used as a
way station for drugs.
   Lehder's former wife, Yemel Nacel, 34, of New York City, and nine
others have pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and are among the
98 people on the government's witness list.

<HEAD>Florida Indictment Shows Haiti Emerging As Cocaine Way Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drug indictment of a top Haitian military
officer has spotlighted that nation's emergence as a way station
for cocaine traffickers seeking safer routes and reinforces charges
that corrupt officials aid smugglers.
   Col. Jean-Claude Paul, along with his brother and ex-wife, were
charged in a federal indictment unsealed Thursday with using a
landing strip on the colonel's farm to fly a 100-kilogram, or
220-pound, cocaine shipment to the Bahamas for delivery to Miami.
   Haitian President Leslie Manigat has turned Paul's case over to
his country's military courts for investigation. There is no
extradition treaty between Haiti and the United States.
   One of the principal witnesses in the case, Osvaldo Quintana,
told reporters in January that he saw 9,000 kilograms, or 19,800
pounds, of cocaine in duffel bags in the Haitian presidential
palace during the administration of ousted leader Jean-Claude
Duvalier.
   Quintana also told The Associated Press that other Haitian
officials besides Paul had a role in the smuggling, but he would
not disclose their names.
   The alleged trafficking by high-level Haitians has angered Sen.
Bob Graham, D-Fla., who said he will introduce legislation this
week to lift U.S. trade preferences with Haiti.
   ``This indictment is further indication that we can't tolerate a
regime in Haiti that seized power from the Haitian people so it
could continue the oppression of the past,'' said Graham.
   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Jack Hook said better
technology such as improved radar and more cooperation from
Bahamian authorities have sharply limited the traditional drug
routes into South Florida.
   That has forced Colombian cocaine traffickers to go through
other Caribbean islands.
   ``We have seen an increase in Haiti being used as a
transshipment point since we stepped up enforcement,'' said Hook.
   Asked about Quintana's allegations that other Haitian officials
are involved, Hook would say only that the investigation is
continuing.
   ``The message that this case sends is the corrupting effects on
public officials everywhere becuse of drug trafficking,'' said Hook.
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., was blunter about the Haitian
connection.
   ``More than two years ago I questioned the DEA about increased
drug trafficking through Haiti, and about government involvement in
the traffic,'' Smith said recently.
   He said the DEA told him then they had no information on Haitian
officials' involvement in drug smuggling.
   ``This is the kind of head-in-the-sand attitude that has allowed
government after government to fall prey to the Colombian
cartels,'' said Smith.
   Whether it is a few corrupt officials, a policy of the new
military-supported government, or just coincidence, Haiti's role
has changed since Duvalier fled.
   ``There has been some increase in drug interceptions since the
Haitian government changed two years ago,'' acknowledged Coast
Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson.
   He said drug officials are spotting more planes flying over the
Haitian half of the island of Hispaniola, which Haiti shares with
the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic recently shot down a
suspected trafficker, but Simpson said Haiti does not have the
resources to chase drug planes.
   Hook said that since November the DEA has had an office in
Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, and is optimistic that Haitian
officials will cooperate.
   In the 90 days before the DEA's arrival, Haitian customs
officials seized 1,500 pounds of cocaine hidden on planes at
Port-au-Prince's airport, he said.
   And the Paul case should make it even more difficult for
traffickers, he said.
   ``The publicity is going to put a little heat on Haiti,'' said
Hook.
   But he said no one should expect trafficking to cease if Haiti
clamps down, since smugglers are already using Cuba, the Turks and
Caicos Islands and other routes.
   ``There is no Caribbean island close to the United States that
has gone unscathed,'' said Hook. ``It just shows the magnitude of
the problem.''

<HEAD>Caribbean Is Gateway of South American Cocaine to US Market</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Colombian drug lords smuggle most of
the cocaine sold in the streets of the United States through the
Caribbean, which has become a strategic narcotics gateway.
   On any given night, small planes from Colombia and other South
American nations drop bundles of cocaine into the blue Caribbean Sea.
   The bundles, bearing sophisticated blinking signal lights, are
then picked up by boats waiting off any one of 25 Caribbean
island-nations or the Bahamas.
   ``No island is exempt, no body of land,'' John Fernandez, the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency spokesman in Miami, said in a telephone
interview. ``It comes by boat, by air ... any type of boat, any type
of plane, any which way traffickers can get drugs in.''
   Officials say the Caribbean became the main cocaine route in the
last few years because of increased drug production and relatively
successful surveillance efforts in usual western routes, including
the U.S.-Mexico border.
   In just two or three hours, a plane carrying cocaine from
Colombia also can fly the 600 or so miles across the Caribbean to
landing fields in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Puerto
Rico, or the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.
   The DEA estimates 60 to 80 percent of the cocaine and marijuana
smuggled to the United States is transshipped from the Caribbean and
the Bahamas, mostly to Florida, for redistribution to American
markets.
   Officials say Puerto Rico, a U.S. Commonwealth, has become a
recent favorite of traffickers because it has no U.S. Customs
inspections for flights leaving for the U.S. mainland.
   ``If it arrives here, it's in the United States,'' said Bill
Mitchell, a DEA special agent in San Juan. ``You can go up to any
airline counter and say you want to ship 20 kilos of hardware to
your sister. It's a domestic shipment. So you don't need to inspect
it.''
   Other ways to ship drugs to the United States from Puerto Rico
are by cruise ships, commercial planes, luggage and the U.S. mails.
But most shipments are made inside ship cargo containers. Puerto
Rico has about 1 million such containers, a number too great for
U.S. Customs to inspect effectively.
   In fiscal 1988, the DEA said, 11 tons of cocaine, 35 tons of
marijuana, nine vessels and 20 aircraft were seized in the Caribbean.
   But it's believed only about 20 percent of drugs shipments are
seized.
   ``Four, five years ago if you found 50 pounds of cocaine, it was
a lot,'' said Jaime Echeverria, in charge of U.S. Customs in Puerto
Rico. ``Today, shipments easily have 1,200 pounds.''
   Echeverria said that because Caribbean islands are small,
smugglers know there is little radar to track air traffic.
   ``There are three radars to detect planes in Puerto Rico but
things such as tropical weather and maintenance often incapacitate
their ability to spot planes,'' he said.
   Fernandez said law enforcers and drug smugglers play a ``cat and
mouse game.''
   ``They have the resources and all the possible technology to
detect where our efforts are,'' he said. ``As soon as they know
where we are, they shift. Then we shift.''
   Lax security in some smaller islands makes them easy stopover
points for drugs and money laundering.
   Corruption also plays a role, especially in nations with low
wages, inflation and unemployment.
   ``Traffickers are ruthless and try to capitalize on the political
and economic instability of a place, say, like Haiti,'' said
Fernandez. ``For example, you get the person in charge of ports ...
who makes $800 a month. I say to him, ``All you got to do is clear
us for inspection and forget about the $800 a month. I'll give you
$10,000.' ''
   Caribbean leaders want a United Nations task force, similar to a
peacekeeping force, to interdict drugs, share intelligence, train
agents and even mount paramilitary attacks on traffickers.
   The proposal is the initiative of Prime Minister Michael Manley
of Jamaica, who said a U.N. force would ease nationalistic hostility
typical of past U.S. drug operations, mainly in Bolivia and Peru.
   ``If I need some muscle, some really first-class narcotics agents
from the United States, somebody is going to scream about
sovereignty,'' Manley said in a recent interview.
   ``No one has ever quarreled with a U.N. peacekeeping force.''
   Manley's initiative was supported at a meeting in July of the
13-member Caribbean Community, which also includes Antigua and
Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana,
Montserrat, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago.

   Defense attorneys for accused
Colombian drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas said today they will rest
their case without calling any witnesses.
   The surprise announcement came on the defense's opening day
after U.S. District Judge Howell Melton denied defense attorneys'
motion for a 60-day delay to allow them time to pore over thousands
of documents introduced during the 22-week trial.
   Lehder, 38, allegedly one of the leaders of the violent Medellin
cartel, is accused of smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United
States from his private island of Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   Lehder's attorney, Edward Shohat, said today the defense
intended only to put some additional documents on the record.
   ``After moving exhibits in evidence, defendant Lehder intends to
rest his case this morning,'' Shohat said.
   Shohat's move came as a surprise. As late as last week, he had
estimated the defense would take two weeks.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller said he could not comment
on the decision itself, but added, ``you could honestly say I
looked surprised and stunned.''
   Stephen Weinbaum, attorney for Lehder's co-defendant Jack
Carlton Reed, 57, said outside the courtrooom he also expects to
rest his case immediately.
   However, Weinbaum said he doubted either side would have closing
arguments ready before the end of the week.
   Following Shohat's announcement, Melton called an hourlong
recess to discuss the defense documents.
   Much of the testimony in the Lehder trial has come from
convicted drug smugglers granted immunity from prosecution, from
others hoping to lessen their sentences and from some who are
awaiting sentencing.
   ``Carlos Lehder pursued a singular dream, a singular vision: to
be the king of cocaine transportation,'' U.S. Attorney Robert
Merkle said in his opening statement in Lehder's trial in
mid-November. ``He was to cocaine transportation what Henry Ford
was to cars.''
   Bahamian officials have also been mentioned during the trial,
with numerous witnesses alleging that Prime Minister Lynden O.
Pindling filled his pockets with bribes from smugglers such as
Lehder.
   Although no violence has been directly attributed to Lehder in
the six-month trial, many witnesses have testified about threats
communicated by Lehder and his workers.
   Lehder is also charged in separate indictments in Los Angeles
and Miami.
   The Miami indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of
the so-called Medellin cartel, believed to be responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into United States _ a bonanza
worth $8 billion each year.

   Prime Minister Lynden Pindling cut short
an official visit to Jamaica and returned to the Bahamas today
because of Hurricane Hugo, but it appeared the killer storm would
spare the islands a direct hit.
   Tropical storm warnings were posted for the central and
northeastern islands. However, light winds and scattered clouds
greeted morning commuters in Nassau.
   The center of Hugo was well to the east, in the open Atlantic,
and was on a course that would carry it safely past the northernmost
Bahamas.
   Late Tuesday, when Hugo appeared more threatening, shoppers and
tourists from the bustling cruise ship trade clogged the city's
downtown, displaying only modest concern that Hugo's 105 mph winds
were blowing a few hundred miles offshore.
   The government issued no emergency instructions, no emergency
shelters were set up and there was no sense of urgent storm
preparation.
   Pindling left the Bahamas on Monday for a Commonwealth Finance
Ministers meeting in Kingston, Jamaica. He was to head to Washington
at week's end.
   Forecasters today said that if Hugo maintained course, it would
continue moving parallel to the Bahamas, bringing high winds and
rains to the islands but not the death and destruction seen in other
parts of the eastern Caribbean.
   Officials at the Bahamas Meteorological Department in Nassau said
late Tuesday, however, there was cause for concern.
   ``It's not enough to deliver a devastating blow,'' said
meteorolgist Nicholas Small. ``But it's not far enough away for us
to relax. We're going to get a healthy tropical wind ranging between
39 and 73 mph, and possibly higher in gusts.''
   The government has begun some preparations: a work crew began
boarding up windows of government buildings. Reuben Henderson,
nailing plywood sheets over windows on a government office building,
said he and his crew had been given those instructions.
   Dorothea Seymour, a shopkeeper in the busy downtown Straw Market,
didn't seem too concerned.
   ``Some people care, some people don't,'' she said. ``We're always
hearing about storms, but they never come.''
   With her business 15 feet from Nassau Harbour, Ms. Seymour said
if the storm came, she would simply pack up her stock of straw
handbags, dolls, hats and T-shirts.
   Four cruise ships were tied up at Prince George Wharf just yards
away, their passengers browsing through shops about the city.
   ``We have not had any cancellations of cruise ships,'' said
Cordell Thompson, a spokesman for the Ministry of Tourism. ``And
there have been no cancellations of air service.''
   Thompson said he didn't think the Bahamas could avoid Hugo's
effects altogether.
   ``I suspect we're going to get a lot of rain and a lot of high
winds,'' he said.
   If the hurricane made a sharp turn to the northwest or the west _
toward the Bahamas _ ``we might start getting nervous,'' Thompson
said.
   Few vacationers appeared worried about facing a hurricane on New
Providence, the Bahamas' most populous island.
   Michael Belt, and his wife Rachelle, of Henderson, Ky., were
among them.
   ``I guess all the people here have to ride it out and I guess
I'll have to ride it out with them,'' Belt said.
   ``I think we'll make it through,'' said Mrs. Belt.

<HEAD>New Indictment Alleges Cuban Cocaine Connection</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal indictments alleging a Cuban role in
cocaine shipments from Colombia marked the third time in recent
months that the Caribbean island nation has been linked to the
narcotics network.
   The two indictments unsealed Friday charged 17 people with
smuggling cocaine into Florida through a Cuban military base, and a
federal drug official said the operation apparently had official
cooperation.
   Nine defendants had been arrested by Friday night, said Jack
Hook, a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro's name surfaced in the indictment
earlier this month of Panamanian strongman Gen. Maneul Antonio
Noriega. Last October, members of a similar drug ring allegedly
operating in part through Cuba were indicted here.
   In an interview broadcast on NBC-TV Thursday, Castro denied
there is drug trafficking of any type in his nation, calling Cuba
``the cleanest country in the world.''
   The evidence in the latest indictment ``does not make a
statement that the Cuban government has an official policy of
assisting drug traffickers,'' said Jack. ``What it does say is that
when a drug-trafficking, private, light aircraft lands on a
military base in Cuba and the cocaine is offloaded and placed onto
boats destined for the U.S., it is quite clear that somebody on
that base in an official capacity is involved.''
   The indictments, returned earlier this week by a grand jury
here, make no mention of involvement by Cuban government officials,
said Ana Barnett, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.
   One indictment charges five people, the other 12.
   The indictments described four cocaine loads totaling 3,800
pounds. Two came through Cuba in April and May, one through Haiti
in October and one through the Bahamas. The date of the Bahamas
shipment was not available.
   ``This does not indict or name or allegedly name any Cuban
officials,'' said Hook. ``But it is significant in proving that
Cuba is most definitely being used as a transshipment point for
Colombian cocaine destined for the United States.''
   Hook said he had no information on how far that involvement goes
in Cuban government.
   One defendant told an informant that he could arrange Cuban
coast guard escorts for drug boats leaving Cuban waters for
Florida, he said.
   Hook said the indictment shows that Cuba, even with its strict
security, is as susceptible to drug trafficking as are other
Caribbean nations, such as the Bahamas and Haiti.
   In October, police broke up a ring that allegedly smuggled drugs
into the United States through Cuba and other Caribbean islands.
Federal officials said there was no evidence of Cuban government
involvement.
   The indictment of Noriega charged that Castro was aware of the
Panamanian's drug activities and mediated a dispute over bribe
money between Noriega and Colombia's Medellin drug cartel. Castro
denied those allegations in the NBC interview.
   NBC also reported Thursday that U.S. officials say they have
solid evidence that Cuban MiG fighters and Cuban coast guard boats
have escorted and protected cocaine shipments on their way from
Colombia to the Florida Keys through Cuba.

<HEAD>Senate Backs Bush in Declaring Bahamas Cooperative in Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday supported President
Bush's certification of the government of the Bahamas as fully
cooperative in the war on drugs, rejecting an effort to overrule
his action.
   Senators voted 57 to 40 to defeat a resolution offered by Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., to brand the Bahamas as uncooperative in
important areas, a move that would have subjected it to the loss of
50 percent of U.S. aid.
   During debate, Kerry said the Bahamian government has been
uncooperative in many areas _ including effective prosecution of
arrested drug traffickers _ while providing only superficial and
self-serving cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies.
   But opponents said that penalizing the Bahamas would be
counterproductive because it would destroy important progress in
the effort to end the role of the Bahamas as a major transfer point
for narcotics flowing from South America to the United States.
   The president is required under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986
to certify to Congress that nations in which narcotics are grown _
or which serve as transit points for narcotics _ are either fully
cooperative with U.S. anti-narcotics efforts or are taking adequate
steps of their own.
   Unless countries are certified, they are subject to strong U.S.
economic sanctions, including the loss of half of U.S. economic,
military or other assistance.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said that the Bahamas have been
remarkably cooperative with U.S. law enforcement officials.
   ``They are the only country to allow unimpeded hot pursuit of
drug traffickers by sea or land,'' DeConcini said.
   He added that the Bahamas have permitted the installation of
radar surveillance equipment, permitted U.S. law enforcement
authorities to conduct undercover operations on Bahamaian soil, and
cooperated in combined operations to arrest drug traffickers and
seize narcotics.
   ``It is estimated that the United States has as many law
enforcement officials in the Bahamas as the Bahamians do,'' De
Concini said.
   But Kerry said he believes the current level of cooperation is
merely a front erected to permit more serious drug operations and
corruption to flourish.
   ``It enables them to pull the wool over our eyes,'' he said.
   ``We've been snookered,'' he said. ``The same thing is taking
place in the Bahamas as happened in Panama, cooperation at one
level, then expansion of a network of narcotics connections.''
   Sen. John Chafee, D-R.I., said, ``The Bahamas probably has some
corruption; I won't certify that it does not. But I do know the
administration has stated that this will not help the situation.''
   However, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., told the Senate: ``We can't
continue to do business as usual if we are to win the war on the
drugs that are sweeping our country. The most serious concern about
the Bahamas today is their failure to prosecute, convict and remove
from positions of influence persons involved in drug trafficking.''

<HEAD>Bahamian Minister Cancels `Today' Interview, May Re-Sue NBC</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bahamanian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling, at
odds with NBC over allegations about drug smuggling, has canceled a
Wednesday appearance on the network's ``Today'' show to discuss the
libel lawsuit he dropped.
   Pindling on Friday accused the network of violating an agreement
by announcing earlier in the day that he had dropped his lawsuit,
filed in Toronto in 1984, against NBC and correspondent Brian Ross.
   The $4 million lawsuit, which also named as defendants 16
Canadian cable and communications companies, stemmed from ``NBC
Nightly News'' broadcasts in 1983 and 1984 about a cocaine cartel
NBC said was operating in the Bahamas.
   The broadcasts quoted U.S. authorities as saying the cocaine
operation was protected by payoffs to Bahamanian officials.
   Pindling, whom NBC said repeatedly declined requests for
interviews before dropping his lawsuit, has denied NBC's
allegations that he was among those officials.
   In a statement Friday in which he said Pindling received neither
money nor an apology from NBC for the broadcasts, NBC News
President Michael Gartner said NBC was delighted that Pindling
dropped his lawsuit.
   ``This is a complete vindication of our journalism,'' he said.
   Pindling later charged that NBC's statements violated a
confidentiality agreement on the lawsuit and distorted the terms
under which it was dropped. NBC denied both accusations Friday and
again Monday.
   Pindling may reinstate the Canadian court lawsuit, and a lawsuit
in U.S. courts ``hasn't been ruled out,'' his spokesman, William
Kalis, said Monday.
   Pindling was to appear on ``Today'' ``to discuss in general
terms the (Friday) settlement,'' Kalis said from Nassau. But he
canceled ``when NBC abrogated the settlement,'' he said.
   In an interview made before Friday's developments and broadcast
Sunday on CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' Pindling said he first sued NBC in
his own country's courts and ``won the case by default'' because
NBC didn't respond.
   Kalis said no money was awarded in that case.
   After that, Pindling said in the CBS broadcast, ``I decided to
sue in a neutral jurisdiction,'' referring to Canada.
   The matter of reinstating Pindling's lawsuit is being discussed
by his attorneys, Kalis said. But because Monday was a holiday _
Thanksgiving _ in Canada, he said, ``there probably won't be a
decision until tomorrow.''

   Busy shoppers and tourists from the
bustling cruise ship trade clogged downtown Nassau, displaying only
modest concern that Hurricane Hugo's 105 mph winds were blowing a
few hundred miles offshore.
   On Tuesday, the government issued no emergency instructions or
orders, no evacuation route signs were visible about the city, no
emergency shelters were set up and there was no sense of urgent
storm preparation.
   The prime minister, Lynden Pindling, was out of the country.
Pindling left the archipelago Monday for a Commonwealth Finance

   Convicted Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos
Lehder said in an interview televised Wednesday that he and
associates paid deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega several
million dollars for protection.
   ``I would not be able to go into exact details as to the extent
of that protection ... because this would not be in my best
interest,'' Lehder said in the interview conducted for the West
German magazine Stern.
   A videotape of the interview _ conducted in November at the
federal prison in Marion, Ill., but not yet published _ was
broadcast by NBC News.
   Lehder said that for about 10 years, Noriega would take all
drugs and drug paraphernalia seized in Panama and sell it to drug
dealers in Colombia, Panama and the United States.
   Lehder was extradited to the United States in 1987 and is
serving a sentence of life in prison plus 135 years. He was charged
with running a large cocaine smuggling operation on a small island
in the Bahamas.
   In the interview, Lehder praised Lyndon Pindling, prime minister
of the Bahamas, as a marvelous, honest leader. Pindling has long
denied allegations of drug corruption involving Lehder, and Lehder
refused to comment on the relationship.
   ``It is possible that I knew the prime minister,'' he said.
``However, whether he was involved or not is an answer that he
himself must give, not me.''
   Noriega faces a February 1988 indictment in Miami of using
Panama to protect cocaine shipments heading north and
drug-processing chemicals and drug money headed south. He was
arrested Jan. 3 following the U.S. invasion.

<TEXT>
   The defense attorney for Carlos Lehder
Rivas charged Wednesday that prosecutors used ``bought witnesses''
who were promised reduced sentences or other favors for testifying
against the reputed Colombian drug lord.
   In closing arguments at Lehder's cocaine-smuggling trial,
defense attorney Edward R. Shohat said the chief prosecution
witness got ``the break of a lifetime'' for his testimony against
Lehder.
   By agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, convicted smuggler Ed
Ward was able to reduce a possible 215-year sentence and $5.9
million fine to less than six years in prison, Shohat said.
   ``Boy, did he put it over on the government,'' said the defense
attorney.
   He charged that Ward lied to the grand jury that indicted Lehder
in 1981 and that he again committed perjury in Lehder's trial. Many
other prosecution witnesses also received deals from prosecutors in
exchange for testimony, he said.
   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are on trial
in federal court on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons
of cocaine into the United States from Colombia via Lehder's
private Bahamian island, Norman's Cay, from 1978 to 1980.
   A separate Miami indictment accuses Lehder of being one of the
leaders of the so-called Medellin cartel, a violent smuggling ring
believed to be responsible a large share of the cocaine entering
the United States.
   Lehder was captured in February 1987 at a mansion near the town
of Medellin after a shootout between Colombian army troops and his
bodyguards. He was immediately whisked onto a U.S. Air Force plane
bound for the United States.
   The prosecution called 115 witnesses in the trial, which began
with jury selection last October. Last week, defense attorneys
surprised the courtroom by announcing that they would be calling no
witnesses.
   Closing arguments were expected to continue through Thursday and
the jury may get the case Friday.
   Winding up his prosecution arguments Wednesday, U.S. Attorney
Robert Merkle referred to testimony that Lehder used bribes, charm
and threats to run a smuggling empire. For once, Merkle said,
Lehder couldn't use such tools.
   ``He cannot buy his way out of a just verdict. He cannot charm
his way out of a just verdict. And he cannot force his way out of a
just verdict,'' Merkle said.
   A day earlier, Merkle told the jury that Lehder was waging a
violent war against the United States and viewed cocaine as a
weapon. ``He's still at war,'' Merkle said.
   In his defense arguments, Shohat told the jury that the judge
would instruct them that they should consider the testimony of
convicted felons with special care.
   ``Boy, do we have convicted felons here!'' he said.
   He argued that many of the government witnesses were given
immunity from prosecution, hoping for reduced sentences or some
type of deal in return for their testimony.
   ``The government brought in 29 bought witnesses,'' he said.
``They paid an incredible price to get Mr. Lehder's conviction.''
   He also argued that much of the testimony did not concern the
charges contained in the indictment.
   ``The issue is not whether Mr. Lehder was good or bad,'' Shohat
said. ``The issue in this case is the 11 counts in the indictment.''
   As an example, Shohat cited the days of testimony concerning
possible payoffs to officials in the Bahamas, including allegations
that Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling had taken bribes. Pindling
has called the allegations ``a fantasy.''
   ``Lynden Pindling is not on trial here in this case. Carlos
Lehder is on trial,'' Shohat said. The payment of bribes to
Bahamian officials, he said, ``is not an issue in this case.''
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged with
smuggling conspiracy.

   The co-defendant in the
cocaine-smuggling trial of Colombian drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas
was declared indigent Tuesday, and his trial lawyer was
re-appointed to serve as his appeal counsel.
   Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., was convicted May
19 on charges he conspired to import cocaine into the United
States. He was sentenced July 20 to 15 years in prison.
   U.S. Magistrate Harvey Schlesinger re-appointed Jacksonville
attorney Stephen Weinbaum to represent Reed.
   Reed was questioned by Weinbaum, Schlesinger and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Ernst Mueller about property he earlier owned in Canada,
Panama and Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   He said he disposed of the property in Canada before his arrest
in February 1987 and that he didn't believe he retains any title to
the properties in the Bahamas and Panama.
   ``As far as I know, the property (on Norman's Cay) was
confiscated by Bahamian officials,'' he said.
   ``I am under the understanding that the property has been
totally ransacked and eaten by termites. If it has any value, it
would be very little,'' Reed said.
   He said if he still owns the property in Panama, ``it has no
value.''
   ``I have nothing but the suit on my back,'' said Reed, adding
that he had no bank accounts, stocks, bonds or any other assets.
   Reed was tried with Lehder, 38, reputed to be one of the leaders
of the violent Colombian Medellin cartel, believed to responsible
for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into this country.
   Lehder was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 135
years, and fined $325,000.
   Jacksonville attorney Clyde Collins was appointed by Schlesinger
to represent Lehder in his appeal until the Colombian can hire
private counsel, replacing trial attorneys Edward R. Shohat and
Jose Quinon.
   Although Reed denied having any assets, the sentencing
memorandum prepared by former U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle, now a
Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, indicates the government
believes that Reed continued to smuggle cocaine until his arrest in
1987 and was not a poor coconut farmer living off the land as he
told Schlesinger.
   According to the memo, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent
Douglas Driver learned in late 1986 that Reed was living in a
remote location on the east coast of Panama.
   ``Between that time and the time of his arrest on Feb. 6, 1987,
Reed was involved in planning large cocaine shipments to the
western United States. ... The United States has two tape
recordings of Reed talking with a confidential source in connection
with these efforts.''
   Lehder and Reed were convicted of being members of a conspiracy
which smuggled some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States from
Colombia via Norman's Cay, a private island in the Bahamas.
   The total amount of cocaine documented in trial testimony was
19,700 pounds. Of that total, according to a chart prepared by
Mueller, Reed transported about 1,200 to 1,400 pounds from Colombia
to Norman's Cay and personally flew some 3,850 pounds of cocaine
into the United States from the tiny Bahamian island, about 40
miles southeast of Nassau.

   Carlos Lehder Rivas' brothers have
threatened the life of a witness who may testify in reputed
Colombian drug kingpin's cocaine-smuggling trial, officials said.
   Lehder, 38, and Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are on trial on charges
they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United
States via Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle said Tuesday he had received
reports from Colombia that Carlos Toro's relatives had been
contacted by Lehder's brothers and told he shouldn't testify.
   Also, on Monday an anonymous male caller telephoned Florida
Publishing Co., which publishes the Jacksonville Journal and The
Florida Times-Union, and said somebody ``would do away with'' Toro
before he can testify.
   Toro, a boyhood friend of Lehder, may be called to testify about
smuggling some 2 tons of cocaine for Lehder through Andros Island,
Bahamas, in 1983 and 1984.
   Merkle refused to discuss any possible investigation into the
incidents by the U.S. Marshal's Service.
   Wendell Welman, a criminal investigator for the Internal Revenue
Service, will continue his testimony today about financial records
of Lehder's companies managed by Guardian Trust Ltd. of Nassau.
   On Tuesday, Welman read a letter in the records of one of the
companies owned by Lehder that told Bahamian officials that Lehder
planned a massive remodeling on the island of Norman's Cay.
   On April 20, 1979, a letter was written to Clement Maynard,
director of tourism for the Bahamas, telling him that Lehder had
bought a large part of Norman's Cay. It tells of his plan to close
public facilities while they were being remodeled ``because of the
poor state of repairs.''
   The letter was written by Ian C. Davidson of Guardian Trust Ltd.
on behalf of International Dutch Resources, one of Lehder's
companies.
   The letter said Lehder's company planned to file documents for
permits to lengthen the airstrip, expand the yacht basin, build new
staff quarters and a new store and possibly build a new restaurant
and hotel on the island.
   The letter supports defense contentions that Lehder planned to
convert Norman's Cay into a tourist resort.
   Prosecutors have contended that Lehder closed Norman's Cay to
the public to protect the island as his cocaine-smuggling haven.
   Welman has been testifying in great detail about documents
relating to six of Lehder's companies.
   At times, members of the jury and spectators have become drowsy,
prompting U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton to issue an
instruction to the jury.
   ``If you are becoming drowsy, let me know if you feel you have a
problem,'' said the judge, who told jurors he would then call a
short break.

   A federal judge today refused to
permit testimony about Nazi memorabilia reportedly seen in the home
of Carlos Lehder Rivas, who is on trial for cocaine smuggling.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton ruled that it was
inadmissable and prejudicial for Gorman Bannister, a protected
federal witness, to mention seeing a gold swastika and statue of
Adolf Hitler in Lehder's home in Medellin, Colombia.
   Lehder, 38, a reputed leader of the violent Colombian Medellin
cartel, is on trial on charges that he conspired to smuggle 3.3
tons of cocaine into the United States from Colombia via an island
he controlled in the Bahamas.
   Bannister told the jury that his father, Everette Bannister,
funneled money to Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling to protect
Lehder's smuggling operation on the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle and Melton got into an exchange
after the judge ruled against the jury hearing testimony about
swastikas and statues in the home of Lehder, a Colombian of German
descent.
   ``I am absolutely befuddled at the court's ruling,'' Merkle said.
   ``If you continue,'' replied Melton, ``you will be in contempt
of court.''
   Bannister said his father, the chairman of Bahamas World
Airlines, had agreed in 1981 to accept $100,000 a month from Lehder
for the use of Norman's Cay.
   His father received only one month's payment.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Jack Cartlon Reed, 57, is charged only with being
part of the alleged conspiracy.
