FT  20 JUL 93 / Belize suspends territorial pact with Guatemala

BELIZE'S new government is to suspend legislation approving an agreement
between the previous administration and neighbouring Guatemala to settle a
130-year-old territorial dispute. Belize has also asked the Guatemalan
government for a review of the pact.
Mr Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of the former British colony, said the
aim was to get Guatemala to renounce all claims on Belizean territory. Mr
Esquivel took office a fortnight ago after a narrow general election
victory.
The pact ending the dispute was reached by Mr George Price, Mr Esquivel's
predecessor, and Mr Jorge Serrano, former president of Guatemala.
'Too many concessions were made by the previous government in order to reach
a speedy conclusion of the matter. We will not allow this to happen,' Mr
Esquivel said.
'Our concern, basically, is that Belize has given up rights it has under
Belizean law. We say that it is not for the government alone to make this
decision. Ultimately, it will have to be by a referendum.'
At the heart of the settlement between Mr Price and Mr Serrano are changes
to Belize's maritime boundaries to satisfy Guatemalan desires for access to
the Caribbean Sea. The changes allow Guatemalan ships use of a navigation
channel in the Gulf of Honduras, bordered by Belize, Guatemala and Honduras.
The agreement was ratified by Belizean legislators and Guatemala's
constitutional court.
Repeated indications over the past two decades that the Guatemalan military
might invade Belize in pursuit of the territorial claim led to the
stationing of a 1,500-member British garrison in Belize. Two months ago the
UK said it intended to withdraw the garrison. During the election campaign
Mr Esquivel claimed that Mr Price's administration had no plans for the
defence of the country.
Guatemalan conservatives and sections of the military have objected to any
agreement which does not satisfy Belizean territorial claims.

<TEXT>
MR Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of Belize, is to ask Britain for further
assurances of military support if the Central American country is threatened
by neighbouring Guatemala.
Mr Esquivel, who will visit Britain between Sunday and Wednesday of next
week for discussions with government officials, said he was increasingly
concerned at continued instability in Guatemala, where the congress and the
supreme court have rejected a demand from President Ramon de Leon Carpio
that they resign.
'All this could provide an opportunity for those elements in Guatemala which
always want to raise the issue of Guatemalan claims to Belize,' Mr Esquivel
said. 'All this concerns us as it could result in the overturning of former
President Jorge Serrano's recognition of Belize.'
Guatemala's 130-year-old territorial claim to Belize was ended last year by
a pact between the then-president Serrano and Mr George Price, the former
premier of Belize, in which Guatemala recognised Belize as an independent
nation.
Worries that the Guatemalan military might invade Belize in pursuit of the
territorial claim led to the stationing of a 1,500-strong UK garrison in
Belize. Earlier this year the British government said it intended to
withdraw the garrison, but would use the facilities for military training.
The garrison has contributed significantly to the economy of Belize. Mr
Esquivel said a new budget next month would take account of the impending
loss of income, as well as under-estimated expenditure and overstated
revenue in the previous budget.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Dec (AFP) -- The UK Embassy in 
Guatemala today confirmed that the Belizean Government will 
assume responsibility for its own defense as of 1 January 1994, 
and announced that it had started the "immediate" withdrawal of 
the UK troops stationed in that country located in the Central 
American isthmus. 
  Lourdes Taylor, the UK Embassy's cultural attache, asserted 
that the process will be completed by September 1994. She 
added, however, that a small UK military detachment would remain 
in Belize to operate a jungle training installation. "This 
action (the troop withdrawal) reflects the UK Government's trust 
in the much-improved relations between Guatemala and Belize and 
the determination of the governments of both countries to 
resolve their bilateral differences peacefully," Taylor asserted. 
  The official's statements alluded to Guatemala's historic 
claims to Belizean territory. The tone of those claims eased 
after former Guatemalan President Jorge Serrano recognized 
Belizean independence in 1991. 
  AFP talked on the phone to the spokesperson of Prime 
Minister 
Manuel Esquivel in Belmopan, and he explained that the UK troop 
withdrawal will be a gradual process, which was planned over the 
past seven months. It will be "a change of style in UK 
assistance" to Belize, Carlos Perdomo, who is Esquivel's private 
secretary, asserted. The official added that after the 
approximately 1,800 soldiers leave Belizean territory, the UK 
will maintain 100 military advisers to operate a special 
training school and that a changing number of UK soldiers will 
come to be trained at that school. 
  Last week, Prime Minister Esquivel stated that the frequent 
raids by Guatemalan soldiers on Belizean territory could be "a 
bad sign" and indicative of a possible invasion. Guatemalan 
authorities denied this possibility. Perdomo disclosed that 
there is no "immediate" fear that the Guatemalan Army will take 
advantage of the UK troop withdrawal to take their demands by 
force. 
  The prime minister's statements, explained his secretary, 
were triggered by the fact that Guatemalan opposition sectors 
have insisted on disavowing all the actions taken by former 
President Serrano, including his agreements with Belize, and 
declared them as unconstitutional. "If an opposition government 
sets in, it is possible that it will act differently from 
Presidents Serrano and (current President) De Leon Carpio have 
acted. This was the reason for the prime minister's 
statements," he added. 
  Belize obtained its independence from the UK in 1981, but UK 
troops have remained on the territory as guarantors of its 
territorial integrity. Ten years later, when it recognized 
Belizean independence, Guatemala renounced a large part of its 
demands for the territory of the young nation. It, however, 
maintains its intentions to negotiate a passage to the Caribbean 
sea through the Belizean Province of Toledo. Guatemala already 
has access to the sea in the extreme southeastern part of its 
territory. Negotiations for the opening can only be initiated 
when the recognition of Belizean independence is ratified by a 
referendum in Guatemala.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 1 Mar (DPA) -- It was officially 
reported today that the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry will send a 
formal note to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
expressing Guatemala's interest in solving the 100-year-old 
territorial dispute with Belize through negotiations or 
international legal procedures. 
  Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys Marithza Ruiz de Vielman 
said that "in order to safeguard Guatemala's rights regarding 
Belize," the Ministry decided to send the note to the UN 
secretary general, "with the appropriate reservations regarding 
the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone, and 
continental shelf, so that it can be circulated as an official 
document of the United Nations." 
  The government of Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
maintains claims over the territory of Belize (23,000 square 
km), which Great Britain unilaterally granted independence on 21 
September 1981. Jorge Serrano Elias, the previous president who 
was ousted on 1 June 1993, recognized Belize and established 
diplomatic relations. Various Guatemalan sectors, including 
Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia, have said 
this was unconstitutional. 
  Moreover, because the border between the two countries has 
not been well defined, some incidents have occurred. The 
Guatemalan Foreign Ministry reported that the Belizean 
Government has affirmed that a group of Guatemalans allegedly 
settled in Belizean territory. This is being investigated by the 
Guatemalan Government. 
  Human Rights Ombudsman Garcia Laguardia has asked for the 
immediate intervention of the Guatemalan Army to protect 
Guatemalan territory, after he personally learned of the threats 
that Belizean soldiers have issued against 35 families in the 
town of Rio Hondo in northern Peten Department, on the border 
with Belize. The ombudsman met with local peasants who provided 
details of the threats. Garcia Laguardia called for strict 
control and surveillance of the border area by the Army to 
guarantee the rights of the Guatemalans.

  [Text] On 1 March at a news conference, Foreign Minister 
Marithza Ruiz Vielman said Guatemala has decided to send a 
formal note to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in order to 
protect Guatemala's rights regarding Belize. She explained that 
the note will contain relevant considerations regarding 
territorial waters, the economic exclusive zone, and the 
continental shelf, with the goal of being distributed as an 
official UN document. 
  Vielman said that reference is made in the note to 
Guatemala's unrestricted compliance to UN Charter principles 
and, consequently, to Guatemala's interest in resolving the 
dispute with Belize. Vielman noted that the solution would be 
attained through negotiation or international jurisdictional 
procedures when she announced that the letter will be sent soon 
and that it will be disclosed to the media as soon as it is. 
  Regarding Guatemalan families' complaints of threats and a 
Belizean military ultimatum to make them leave their lands, 
which are allegedly in Belizean territory, she said the presence 
of settlers has been confirmed "to the east of the historic 
monuments that are being used as a reference point with Belize." 
She pointed out that "in case they prove the settlement is 
located in the protected Mayan biosphere area and that it was 
established illegally, the settlers will have to leave the area, 
but the Guatemalan Government will see to it that their rights 
are respected and that they are able to take the products of 
their harvest and their personal goods." 
  Vielman also clarified that Guatemala's interest in seeking 
a 
solution causing the least possible damage to the settlers 
should not be viewed as a renunciation of its rights in the 
territorial claim. She said that Guatemala and Belize have not 
recognized the mentioned monuments as a demarcation line, which 
was confirmed by the 31 July 1992 Joint Declaration. Vielman 
stated that "while the territorial dispute has not been resolved 
and with the sole purpose of avoiding a confrontation, the 
monuments have been used as a reference point by authorities 
from both countries." 
  Vielman added that if the settlers must be removed, no 
deadline will be stipulated because, with the protection of 
Guatemalan authorities, they will determine the time they need 
to prevent losing their crops. She refused to accept that this 
is a threat by the Belizean Government, and instead called the 
Belizean statement "a message to withdraw from there," in 
accordance with the Guatemalan ambassador in Belize. 
  The official argument for the removal of the settlers from 
the place is that it pertains to the Mayan biosphere, and this 
is why, when de Vielman was asked about the reasons why this 
policy is not followed with other people in similar conditions, 
she only replied that it concerns the organizations in charge. 
Finally, Vielman said the Belizean Commission will be in charge 
of drafting the mechanisms to be followed in the territorial 
claim case, and she could not venture to express her view in 
that regard.

  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 3 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, 
Foreign Relations Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman said the 
Guatemalan Government is interested in resuming the stalled 
negotiations on the more than 150-year-old territorial dispute 
between Belize and Guatemala. 
  The negotiations were interrupted in the aftermath of the 
failed 26 May 1993 coup d'etat by former President Jorge 
Serrano, who recognized the Belizean state, a British colony 
until 1981, for the first time in Guatemalan history and 
established diplomatic relations. President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio upheld the Serrano's decision (1991-93), although many 
political sectors and citizens have demanded he change his 
position. 
  Today, Minister Vielman told foreign correspondents the 
following: "As the executive branch, we have no jurisdiction" in 
recognizing Belize as an independent state. She failed to say, 
however, whose jurisdiction such a decision would fall under. 
  She pointed out that the "Belize Council," a new council 
comprising lawyers and other experts on the subject, must deal 
with this issue. The council, which will serve an advisory 
role, will revise the previous legislation and will recommend to 
the government what to do next. The Belize Council, whose 
appointment will be announced next week, will make 
recommendations that will be reviewed by the executive branch 
"in accordance with foreign policies before acting upon them." 
  The foreign minister insisted this is a legal conflict, but 
said she trusts the territorial dispute will have a negotiated 
solution and avoid arbitration within the international courts.

Belize says neighbouring Guatemala has revived its claim to Belizean
territory, despite an interim agreement reached two years ago between the
two Central American countries, Canute James reports from Kingston.
The Belizeans say Guatemala's 130-year-old claim was revived in a letter
sent this month by the government to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general, saying that an end to Guatemala's claim on the former
British colony would come only with a final treaty.
The latest Guatemalan statement coincides with the dismantling of a
1,500-strong British garrison which had been stationed in Belize to
discourage the Guatemalan military from invading in pursuit of the
territorial claim.

<F P=106> [Report by Lucia Perez Moreno] </F>
  [Text] Athens, 29 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Belize today abandoned 
the 10th Central American and European Union [EU] Foreign 
Ministers' Meeting after Greece, the host country, withdrew its 
observer status. 
  The incident occurred after the Guatemalan delegation asked 
Theodoros Pangalos, current chairman of the European Council of 
Ministers, to withdraw Belize's status as observer at the 
ministerial meeting. 
  "Belize's participation in the San Jose meetings will depend 
on the context of negotiations on the territorial dispute," it 
was stated to NOTIMEX by Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys 
Marithza Ruiz de Vielman. 
  Guatemala and Belize established diplomatic relations in 
1981, although the two countries have yet to settle a 
territorial dispute. 
  "We were invited by the council's chairman. We do not 
consider this the place to discuss differences between Guatemala 
and Belize," said Ursula Brown, Belize's ambassador to the 
United Kingdom, shortly before her departure. 
  A participant in the meeting said Greece made "a mistake in 
formalities" when it invited Belize as an observer without first 
consulting with the Central American country. 
  The problem arose when the Belizean representative stood 
close to the EU and Central American foreign ministers when 
posing for a group picture of the meeting, which is currently 
being held at an elegant hotel on the outskirts of the Greek 
capital. 
  Belize, with a population of 200,000, achieved its 
independence from the United Kingdom in 1986, and Guatemala has 
demanded the return of part of their common border since then. 
  Although Belize had been invited to participate as an 
observer in other international forums on Central America, this 
was the first time it had been invited to participate in the San 
Jose Summit.

  [Text] Yesterday, in an appearance before the Congress of 
the Republic, Foreign Relations Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman 
confirmed that Guatemala still maintains its territorial claims 
over Belize and plans to allow the people to voice their opinion 
on the issue by means of a referendum. 
  During a meeting with the Foreign Relations Committee, the 
minister explained that no unexpected readjustments to the 
guidelines of the dispute with the Belizean people are expected 
to take place during her term as minister and that they are 
prepared to resort to any legal means in order to resolve the 
dispute. 
  As established by the Constitution, after the Belize Council 
has been established, one of the points to be put on its agenda 
will be to request the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to call the 
Guatemalan people to a referendum so they may voice their 
opinion on the issue. 
  Even though the minister indicated that the Belize Council 
will be directly responsible for negotiating the territorial 
dispute, she also explained that at any given moment it could 
request mediation by the international community, which has 
expressed interest in the problem. 
  In addition, the United Nations will be made aware of the 
objectives sought by the proviso submitted a few months ago. 
  With respect to the extradition of [former President] Jorge 
Serrano Elias, the minister indicated that the court responsible 
for the case has not yet forwarded any [extradition] request to 
the Foreign Ministry. 
<H5>  Belize Council To Be Established in 10 Days </H5>
  The foreign minister stated that the Belize Council will be 
established in no less than 10 days. She also abstained from 
identifying the candidates selected to become members of the 
aforementioned council and indicated that there are still talks 
to be held with some of them in order to confirm their 
disposition to participate. 
  According to the foreign minister, a preliminary list of 
candidates has already been discussed with President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio, and, if there are no objections, she would proceed 
to forward invitations to the citizens named as possible council 
members.

130-year-old territorial dispute with Britain and Belize, in which Guatemala
was claiming the former British colony with which it has a common border,
writes Canute James.
Guatemalan legislators have ratified a recent ruling by a constitutional
court supporting the decision of President Jorge Serrano to recognise
Belize's political independence and to establish diplomatic ties between the
two countries.
The decision by the Congress is likely to end the dispute, although a
referendum must be held in Belize before the treaty is ratified.
Repeated indications over the past two decades that the Guatemalan military
might invade Belize in pursuit of their territorial claim led to the
stationing of a 1,500-member British garrison in Belize.
However, the 78-24 vote by Congress is likely to anger sections of the
Guatemalan military and political right.

MR George Price, prime minister of Belize, has called a general election for
June 30, 15 months before it was constitutionally due.
The announcement came a few hours after the resignation of Mr Jorge Serrano
as president of neighbouring Guatemala. He and Mr Price had reached an
accord to end Guatemala's 130-year-old territorial claim on the former
British colony in Central America.
The Belizean opposition is claiming that the government has no plans to
defend the country against any invasion by Guatemala.
Britain announced last month that it is to withdraw its 1,400-strong
garrison in Belize. British troops had been stationed there to deter
Guatemala from military action to pursue its claim.
Mr Price's People's United party has a comfortable parliamentary majority,
and the election is expected to keep it in power at the expense of the main
opposition United Democratic party.

VISITORS arriving at the international airport see an immediate and graphic
illustration of Belize's relations with its neighbours.
On either side of the runway and around the airport are camouflage netting,
anti-aircraft guns, helicopters and fighter aircraft ready for action.
The trappings of the British military garrison in Belize, they represent a
passing phase in the country's foreign policy. The garrison's purpose had
been to deter aggression by Guatemala which had threatened to invade in
pursuit of a 130-year-old territorial claim.
Now, however, Belize and Guatemala are heading towards a diplomatic solution
of their differences. Belize is also hoping to make friends of other Central
American countries which had backed Guatemala's claim. The role of the
British troops will then change: they are likely to stay for training
purposes.
Belize is both Caribbean and Central American. It sits between two regions
which have been economically, politically and culturally poles apart.
Once the dispute with Guatemala is settled, Belize should be able to act as
an economic and political bridge between its immediate neighbours and the
archipelago to the east.
It is a member of the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) which is
struggling to create a customs union, a monetary union and a common market.
It shares with its antillean neighbours many of the economic difficulties
and uncertainties of small economies. Belize might even become involved in
other efforts at economic integration, such as the emerging common market in
Central America.
Mr George Price, Belize's prime minister, and his predecessor in office, Mr
Manuel Esquivel, have attended summits of the Caribbean Community. Recently,
Mr Price was invited to observe summits of Belize's Latin neighbours.
'Belize is now is a position to do more in Central America because we have
now established diplomatic relations with Guatemala,' says the prime
minister. 'There have been two meetings of Caribbean and Central American
ministers to discuss bananas. Belize has also attended two Central American
summits.'
The West Indian Commission, which has been studying ways of increasing the
level of integration of Caribbean economies, also concluded that Belize can
play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between the Caribbean and Central
America.
'A further objective of Caricom policy must be the exploration of possible
levels of economic relationships with the Central American countries,' the
Commission concludes. 'Here, in fact, are the makings of a system of
competition between the two sub-groupings of the Caribbean Basin  .. in
industrial and agricultural exports.'
It says that thanks to its location and its political inclinations Belize is
naturally at the forefront of co-operation between the two regions. But Mr
Esquivel feels that too much is being made of the role which Belize can play
in bringing the Caribbean and Central America closer together.
Belize, he says, cannot be an effective bridge between the two regions
because it has no influence in Central America. 'Because of the Guatemalan
claim we have been ostracised by Central America and we have kept out of
Central American affairs, so we cannot claim any influence in Central
America,' he concludes.
'Our political and economic influence in the Caribbean is minimal as well
because of our geography. Rather than being a bridge, we are desperately
trying to straddle two regions to keep our balance.' There is one very real
and seemingly intractable problem which divides the Caribbean islands and
Central America, and which could determine the value of a friendship with
Belize.
The creation of a single European market in January has put a question mark
over the preferential market for bananas which Belize, the Caribbean islands
and other developing countries have in Europe. The EC is struggling with a
formula which satisfies the desires of the traditional suppliers, such as
Belize, to maintain preferential access, while meeting the demands of the
tendency towards freer international trade, as being demanded by Latin
American producers, including Belize's immediate neighbours.
The disagreement threatens to abort any hopes of meaningful co-operation
between the Caribbean and Central America. Mr Price has attempted to close
the gap on bananas through meetings of government officials and ministers
from the two regions.
Inevitably, there has been effective technical co-operation between Belize
and its Central American neighbours. Matters such as dealing with Latin
America's cholera epidemic, a common approach to the problems of refugees in
the region, and restoration and preservation of Amercan Indian artefacts,
have provided ground for Belize's integration into the region in the wake of
better relations with Guatemala.
Mr Ismael Garcia, Belize's ambassador to Central America, has concluded that
there is now an opportunity for meaningful co-operation in trade and
agriculture. Belize once gained substantially from transhipment of exports
and imports for southern Mexico.
'Belize could prosper from the fact that it is English-speaking and could be
an entrepot such as Panama was,' says Mr Geoffrey Hart, the manager of
Barclays Bank in Belize. 'This country could, for example, warehouse
material for distribution to Central America. There are opportunities for
Belize to be Europe's gateway to North American Free Trade Area.'
The next stage in Belize's efforts at being a good neighbour, however, will
be determined by others. The Guatemalan government's proposals for resolving
the territorial dispute are being contested in a constitutional court. Much
hangs on the court's decision. Belize's relations with its Central American
neighbours still hinge on its ties with Guatemala.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 11 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, the 
Guatemalan Foreign Ministry asserted in a letter to UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the country has signed no 
agreement establishing borders with Belize, and it adds that 
Guatemala maintains a territorial claim on the former British 
colony. 
  Foreign Minister Marithza Ruiz de Vielman asked the United 
Nations to inform its member states about the Guatemalan 
Government's territorial claim, which includes an area of land 
in Belizean territory and maritime areas on the Caribbean Ocean. 
Ruiz de Vielman said the joint declaration signed by the two 
states on 31 July 1992 does not recognize the definition of 
their territorial and maritime limits. She recalled that 
Guatemala recognized Belize as an independent state in September 
1992 without relinquishing its claim, which dates back 150 years. 
  The diplomat's letter to Ghali emphasized that the 
government 
respects the free determination of nations and believes the 
settlement of controversies between states should be reached 
through peaceful means. She added that the Guatemalan Government 
is prepared to continue direct discussions with the former 
British colony to reach a definite solution to the dispute. 
  "Guatemala formally rejects anything which violates its 
sovereignty, continental shelf, control of its territorial seas, 
or exclusive economic zone, both those defined in the past and 
those which may result when the dispute is settled," the text 
added. The document said Guatemala's territorial sea is 12 
maritime miles (more than 18 km) wide. 
  "Until the dispute is settled, Guatemala cannot accept nor 
does it accept boundaries that are equidistant to states, 
adjacent coasts, or coasts that face each other if they 
negatively affect its sovereign right to 12 maritime miles," she 
emphasized. Ruiz said the government is willing to adopt control 
measures to prevent the violation of its laws and its customs, 
immigration, and health regulations. 
  She confirmed that the country's economic zone comprises an 
area beyond its territorial sea and adjacent zones, which extend 
200 maritime miles beyond the boundaries used to measure the 
width of its territorial sea. Also, the continental shelf 
extends 200 miles with exclusive sovereignty rights to exploit 
its natural resources, she said. 
  She emphasized that Guatemala will not recognize the 
charters 
or lists of geographic coordinates prepared by Belize until they 
reach a definite agreement that is satisfactory to the two 
parties. The foreign minister asked the United Nations to inform 
its member states about Guatemala's position on Belize.

MR Manuel Esquivel, a 53-year-old businessman, is to be sworn in by the
weekend as prime minister of Belize, following a narrow victory by his
United Democratic party in the general election on Wednesday.
Preliminary results yesterday gave the UDP 15 of the 29 seats in the Central
American state's assembly, with 13 for the People's United party of Mr
George Price, the long-serving prime minister. A recount was under way in
one constituency.
The result suggests a miscalculation by Mr Price, who called the election 15
months before it was due. He had hoped to be returned to office on the basis
of steady economic growth in the former British colony. Also, the PUP had
done well in recent by-elections.
In the month-long campaign, however, Mr Esquivel's UDP closed the gap,
arguing that Mr Price's administration was corrupt. He charged the
government with having given Belizean citizenship and voting rights to
thousands of refugees from neighbouring Guatemala, Honduras and El
Salvador,in a bid to win the election.
Mr Esquivel also proposed free education, from primary school to university,
as well as income tax concessions.
The PUP's loss has raised questions over the political future of Mr Price,
who has dominated the politics of the country of 200,000 people for 40
years, and has been its political leader for all but five years since 1954.
If Mr Price steps down as PUP leader, he is likely to be succeeded by Mr
Said Musa, foreign minister, or Mr Florencio Marn, a former deputy prime
minister.
Mr Esquivel, who was prime minister in 1984-1989, is not expected to bring
any great political changes to Belizean domestic affairs.
During the campaign, however, he accused the Price administration of making
too many concessions to Guatemala in an effort by the government to bury for
good a 130-year-old Guatemalan territorial claim on Belize, which Guatemala
recently declared that it had relinquished.
The opposition leader suggested the suspension of legislation which grants
Guatemala access to the Atlantic Ocean through Belizean territory.

THE opposition in Belize has accused the government of having no alternative
plans for the country's defence after British troops leave. Local economists
are also expressing concern about the impact of the pull-out, announced by
the British government last week.
The garrison of 1,400 troops was stationed in the central American country
to deter neighbouring Guatemala, which threatened many times to invade the
former British colony in pursuit of a 130-year-old territorial claim. The
overall responsibility for defence will pass to the 600-strong Belize
Defence Force.
Britain said it was closing the garrison, but would leave 150 soldiers in
Belize and use the facilities for training. The move follows agreements
between Belize and Guatemala in the past two years which have cleared the
way for a diplomatic end to the dispute.
The contingent is a significant contributor to the Belize economy.
Maintaining the garrison in Belize costs the British government about
Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) a year. Economists say the country earns Dollars
35m a year (about a fifth of the country's gross domestic product) from the
presence of the garrison.
The government denied it was unprepared for the British decision.

yesterday said his government is prepared to begin negotiations 
on the territorial dispute with Guatemala; adding that a 
commission has been created for this purpose and only the final 
details must be settled. 
  The Guatemalan Government has recognized Belize's 
independence; therefore, we have accepted the fact that a border

organization of a Belizean Council, the ambassador said this is

  Belize is interested in establishing trade, cultural,

said. The ambassador also said he cannot release the names of 
the persons who make up the Belizean commission that will 
participate in the negotiations, because he does not have them. 
  He also referred to the role played by the media in the 
case, 
which is important, to establish the objective atmosphere 
necessary to settle relations between the States of Guatemala

independent state by the media, and the illustration of this on

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio yesterday 
acknowledged that there are Guatemalan settlers residing in 
Belizean territory; however, he explained that no pressure has 
ever been exerted on the peasants by Belize to get them to leave 
the area. Land is being sought to transfer them into those 
protected areas, he added. [sentence as published] 
  De Leon Carpio explained that his government's plan is to 
have the families living in the Chiquibul region leave the area, 
because it is a nature reserve. He added that studies are being 
conducted with the authorities of the National Institute of 
Agrarian Reform (INTA) to transfer these people to an area that 
meets their basic living requirements. 
  Nevertheless, he reiterated that Belizean troops are not 
driving these people out, as had previously been reported. He 
also said there is no final deadline for the withdrawal of the 
settlers. 
  "The government is taking all necessary measures for those 
peasants to settle in lands that will enable them to raise their 
crops. It is necessary for them to withdraw from Chiquibul, 
because this is a national park. But certainly, it is not 
because Belize is pressuring them to leave," De Leon Carpio 
noted. 
  In light of the situation, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Antonio 
Monzon assured that the Guatemalans will be transferred in 
September to the Dolores municipality in Peten, located several 
kilometers from where they are currently settled. He explained 
that the trip will be sponsored by INTA, the Peten Land 
Committee, and the National Fund for Peace. 
  This issue caused several reactions last week when Carlos 
Asturias, former governor of the northern department of Peten, 
disclosed that Belizean troops had set a 25 June deadline for 
the settlers to withdraw from the area. 
  Asturias recently said the report had been received by a 
parish priest in the region, explaining that a group of soldiers 
who patrol the border area "are threatening them constantly."

  [Text] Mexico City, 20 Jan (PL) -- The Belizean Armed 
Forces this year allotted $10 million to strengthen its military 
so it will be prepared to defend national sovereignty, 
government sources disclosed today. 
  This announcement is related to a statement made last 
November by Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel, who said that the 
imminent withdrawal of British troops from this state would 
probably encourage its Guatemalan neighbors to reclaim this 
territory, a former colony of the United Kingdom until 1983. 
  According to reports received in Mexico, spokesmen for the 
Belizean Government assured that the government is planning to 
gradually increase its troops in response to the withdrawal of 
the British, who defended the country until last 31 December. 
  The withdrawal of 1,200 men and combat equipment, including 
several squadrons of planes of various models, practically 
concluded on 1 January 1994. 
  According to official data, Belize has 1,000 armed men, 
while 
Guatemala has an army of 30,000 soldiers. 
  A representative of the Armed Forces said the objective was 
to add 1,500 men in 1994 and attract more recruits in the 
following years, depending on the state budget, while making 
structural changes in the corps. 
  Diplomatic sources in Belmopan said the internal situation 
was calm, even though Guatemala has on previous occasions tried 
to annex the territory. 
  Julio Roberto Herrera, Guatemalan vice consul in the 
neighboring Mexican city of Chetumal (southern state of Quintana 
Roo), said that from the times of the administration of Jorge 
Serrano Elias, his country has ruled out a military intervention 
in Belize. 
  After pointing out that Guatemala has other priorities, the 
diplomat said: "We respect the sovereignty of Belize, and even 
though we claimed that territory at one time, it doesn't mean we 
are planning an invasion."

BELIZE holds a general election today with the ruling party trying to play
down concerns that the country's security is threatened by political
uncertainty in neighbouring Guatemala and a planned pull-out by British
forces.
The election was called by the prime minister, Mr George Price, 15 months
before it was constitutionally due. The election follows the removal from
office of Guatemalan president Mr Jorge Serrano, with whom Mr Price had
reached an accord - yet to be ratified - ending the 130-year-old Guatemalan
claim on Belize.
In a bid to calm fears over Guatemala's attitude to the agreement, Mr
Antonio Castellanos, ambassador to Belize, issued a statement at the weekend
saying that 'the new Guatemalan government will respect and honour all
international agreements.'
Mr Price's People's United Party is expected to retain a majority in the
assembly, but to be closely challenged by main opposition United Democratic
Party led by Mr Manuel Esquivel. The opposition accuses the government of
having no plans to defend the country following last month's British
decision to withdraw a 1,400-strong garrison.

  [Text] The National Council on Belize, which will be in 
charge of conducting a general and thorough evaluation of the 
dispute over that territory, was officially installed today. 
  An agreement to update and reorganize the National Council 
on 
Belize specifies that the entity will do studies and planning 
and will advise the Foreign Ministry on all matters related to 
the territorial dispute with Belize. 
  The Council will be headed by Foreign Minister Gladys 
Maritza 
Ruiz de Vielman and will be made up of the following persons, 
who will work without compensation: Fernando Andrade Diaz 
Duran, Roberto Bermejo Gonzalez, Eduardo Castillo Arriola, Erwin 
Fernando Guzman Ovalle, (Alberto Errarte Gonzalez), Roberto 
Herrera Ibarguen, Carlos Larios Ochaita, Jorge Lujan Munoz, 
Oscar Clemente Marroquin Godoy, Gabriel Orellana Rojas, Mario 
Quinonez Amezquita, Jorge Skinner Klee, and Francisco Villagran 
Kramer. 
  The 8 June agreement states that the territorial dispute 
with 
Belize and the search for a solution within the framework of the 
Constitution and the principles of international law are matters 
of national interest. The document recognizes the 
appropriateness of the Foreign Ministry receiving the advice of 
qualified citizens who, based on their knowledge and 
capabilities, can help formulate an adequate policy to resolve 
the territorial dispute with Belize.

   Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel and
former leader George Price conducted a flurry of campagining on the
eve of the nation's general elections Monday.
   All campaigning, including television and radio commercials,
officially ended at midnight Sunday _ seven hours before the polls
open for 11 hours.
   Voters will cast ballots for the 28 seats in the lower house of
the legislature and the party that wins the most seats will name the
prime minister. Terms of office are for five years.
   Esquivel, of the conservative United Democratic Party, said
during the campaign that his administration brought economic
recovery to Belize and efficient government.
   Price, leader of the centrist People's United Party, was defeated
by Esquivel in the 1984 election. His campaign slogan was
``Belizeans first,'' and he accused Esquivel of giving too much to
foreigners to gain investments and tourism.
   Price was the top Belizean official when the country was a
self-governing British colony before it became independent in 1981.
   No public opinion polls were taken but political observers said
they belived Esquivel held a slight edge.
   His party holds 21 seats in the lower house and the United
Democratic Party the remaining seven.
   Elections officials say 82,589 of the country's 160,000 residents
are eligible to vote.
   Initial results are expected about midnight Monday.
   In his criticism of alleged foreign influence, Price attacked a
program that allows foreigners to purchase $25,000 bonds and then
apply for citizenship. If the applicants don't qualify for
citizenship they can redeem the bonds but if they do they can become
citizens and the bond is to be repaid without interest in 10 years.
   The plan is aimed mainly at residents of Hong Kong, a British
colony that is to revert to China in 1997. Many Hong Kong residents
are expected to flee the colony rather than accept control by
communist China.
   Esquivel has said that during the past five years prices for
sugar, fruits and other major exports have been stable and foreign
investments and tourism have doubled.
   Belize has a bicameral legislature with an elected House of
Representatives and appointed Senate. The house determines which
party will form a new government.
   Belize, smaller than Connecticut, is on the Central American
mainland but maintains closer cultural ties with other
English-speaking former British colonies in the Caribbean than with
its Spanish-speaking neighbors.
   Neighboring Guatemala maintains a territorial claim against
Belize, formerly British Honduras, and British troops are stationed
in the country in case of hostilities with Guatemala.

  [Text] Human Rights Ombudsman Dr. Jorge Mario Garcia 
Laguardia requested the Army's and the Foreign Ministry's 
intervention to protect the nation's territorial integrity and 
the lives of Guatemalans settled along the Belizean border. 
During his visit to the region, the ombudsman personally 
learned about the threats that Belizean soldiers issued against 
35 families who live at the border town of Rio Blanco, Dolores, 
Peten Department. The high-ranking official met with peasants 
of the aforementioned town and the mayor of Dolores who gave a 
detailed account of the threats issued by the Belizean military. 
  Sebastian Tux, a peasant, asked the ombudsman to clearly 
demarcate the boundary with Belize, because last year Belizean 
soldiers also forced them to abandon their land, where they left 
behind a crop of approximately 2,500 quintals of beans and 2,000 
quintals of corn. He added: If necessary we, the peasants, 
offer our labor to build a boundary along the border. We have 
looked for another place to relocate, but have not found one. 
He said they would rather stay than emigrate from the lands 
they have tilled for many years. 
  Moreover, Ombudsman Garcia Laguardia said it all began when 
former President Jorge Serrano accepted Belize's independence 
and established diplomatic relations with its government, an 
unconstitutional act that would have never been accepted by the 
Guatemalans if a referendum had been held on the issue. 
  However, he added, two key institutions have to intervene: 
the Army and the Foreign Ministry. Besides, the Armed Forces 
are duty bound to maintain strict control of the border, which 
it has apparently neglected; and the Foreign Ministry has to 
mediate with the Belizean Government through diplomatic channels 
to prevent these actions. Referring to this, he asked the Army 
to permanently protect the border zone and guarantee Guatemalan 
rights; and he asked the Foreign Ministry to mediate 
diplomatically to put an end to hostilities and provide 
guarantees to the Guatemalan citizens, so they may live in their 
country and exercise their rights.

Belize says neighbouring Guatemala has revived its claim to Belizean
territory, despite an interim agreement reached two years ago between the
two Central American countries, Canute James reports from Kingston.
The Belizeans say Guatemala's 130-year-old claim was revived in a letter
sent this month by the government to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general, saying that an end to Guatemala's claim on the former
British colony would come only with a final treaty.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 27 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- The Guatemalan 
Government and Army today rejected the "ultimatum" given by the 
Belizean authorities to 18 Guatemalan families who have been 
ordered to withdraw from lands they are occupying. 
  According to the Belizean Embassy, the peasants, who have 
established themselves in the "Chiquibul" national park, have 
been given 15 days to clear the area with a deadline that 
expires on 10 March. 
  Guatemalan Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz said Guatemala does 
not acknowledge the Belizean Government's authority to give 
alleged "ultimatums" to Guatemalan families living in border 
areas. 
  Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez 
asserted that the Army will not tolerate any "meddling" on 
Belize's part in Guatemala's national sovereignty, much less the 
"intimidation" of Guatemalan citizens. 
  Enriquez added that the Belizean authorities are "being 
unreasonable" and that they cannot set deadlines for families to 
abandon the area in question because Guatemala still disputes 
ownership of that territory. 
  Belize gained its independence from Great Britain in 
September 1981, and the administration of deposed Guatemalan 
President Jorge Serrano (1991-1993) recognized it as a state. 
However, Guatemala has maintained its claim on the region for 
over a century and a half. 
  The defense minister said the Army is prepared to support 
the 
Guatemalan families living in the "Chiquibul" national park, 
where they have built their homes. Enriquez dismissed the 
possibility of clashes with Belizean soldiers.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (3): A dominating personality - Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MORE than 40 years, the politics of Belize has been dominated by one man
and one party. Mr George Price helped to form the People's United Party in
1949. This move - a response to the devaluation of the British Honduras
dollar which hit the pockets of Belizeans - established an anti-colonialist
party which the British originally viewed with suspicion.
This suspicion lifted over the next 15 years, and Belize would undoubtedly
have claimed full independence in the 1960s were it not for the Guatemalan
claim over Belize. In 1964, the country became self-governing, except for
foreign policy, defence and internal security. Full independence was gained
on September 21, 1981.
The PUP won the six general elections held from 1954 to 1979, losing to the
opposition United Democratic Party in 1984. Against the odds, it narrowly
won the 1989 general election - with a narrow 15-13 majority in the House of
Representatives. Its majority was strengthened after one opposition deputy
switched to the government benches.
Unmarried, austere and a devout Catholic, Mr Price, 73, is seen as likely to
fight the next election, which must be held by 1994. The prime minister, the
last of the generation of post-independence commonwealth leaders, has no
obvious successor within the party. Those seen as most likely to succeed him
are Mr Said Musa, foreign minister, and Mr Florencio Marin.
Although the party rhetoric would suggest otherwise, the policies of the two
main parties have proved hard to distinguish. Although ostensibly more
populist than the pro-market UDP, the PUP in government has followed similar
policies in favour of privatisation and continued investment.
This has calmed the disquiet among investors following the 1989 election
which the PUP won by appealing to nationalist sentiment with the slogan
'Belizeans first' and charges that the UDP had allowed foreign speculators
to dominate the economy. The US embassy's assessment of the investment
climate in the country remains 'excellent'.
Mr Manuel Esquivel, the UDP leader and former prime minister, agrees the
'PUP were more effective in fighting the election than we were'.
Since the election the opposition has split over the aimed-for settlement
with Guatemala, which Mr Esquivel's party has supported. A faction, led by
Mr Philip Goldson, a respected senior politician, has ceded from the UDP and
formed a new party, the National Alliance for Belizean Rights.
Mr Esquivel says his party sacrificed 'party integrity in favour of national
integrity' in supporting the government over the Guatemalan settlement. 'We
felt this was an opportunity to end this problem once and for all by making
a minor concession to solve a major problem.'
This may add to his problems in fighting the municipal elections in March.
But he says that in the the long run the UDP will not be hurt, since the
NABR is a one-issue party.

   A Guatemalan gunboat fired a shot after a British
naval vessel refused its order to halt off the Central American
country of Belize, the Foreign Office said today.
   A spokesman said the government will bring up Sunday's incident
with the Guatemalan authorities, but he could not say whether a
protest would be filed.
   ``We'll have it taken up with them. What form that will take,
frankly I don't know,'' the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. ``We'll have to talk with them first.''
   He said the HMS Fawn, an 800-ton inshore survey vessel, was in
the territorial waters of Belize when the Guatemalan gunboat ordered
it to stop.
   When the Fawn ignored the order, the gunboat fired a shot. Two
Royal Air Force Harrier jet fighters flew to the area, and the
Guatemalans agreed to withdraw their ship after telephone contact
with British authorities, said the official.
   Belize, a former British colony, gained independence in 1981 but
requested British troops to remain until a territorial dispute with
neighboring Guatemala is resolved. About 2,000 British troops are
stationed in Belize.

of growing social problems, Stephen Fidler says it is possible to be

<TEXT>
WHILE civil war ravaged the rest of central America in the 1980s, Belize
remained an oasis of calm. As heavy debt and economic crisis engulfed Latin
America, Belize achieved high growth and single-digit inflation. In a zone
with a history of military regimes and political instability, Belize offered
democracy and respect for the rule of law.
Belizeans are proud of what differentiates them from their neighbours; but
their destiny will probably lie as much with the Hispanic countries
surrounding them as it does with their traditional allies in the
English-speaking Caribbean.
Belize is becoming, ethnically at least, more like its neighbours. An
estimated 40,000 people - a fifth of the population - have arrived from
neighbouring states over the past decade, fugitives from civil war or
economic deprivation. The influence of the creoles - the Afro-European group
that has traditionally dominated Belizean society - has meanwhile weakened
because of emigration.
This has caused tension: the newcomers have provided the manpower for
agriculture, the engine for growth in the 1980s. But they have put pressure
on health services and schools.
The prime minister, Mr George Price, who with his People's United Party has
dominated Belizean politics for 40 years, has spoken of the country as a
bridge between central America and the Caribbean. This is a long way from
reality, but it is part of a growing recognition among the mini-states of
the two sub-regions of the costs of isolation.
Until last year, practical co-operation with the rest of central America was
impossible because of Guatemala's claim over the territory of Belize. The
claim delayed independence of Belize - known until 1973 as British Honduras
 -until 1981 and was the reason for Britain's maintenance of a garrison of
1,800 men and a squadron of Harrier jets.
Following guidelines hammered out between the two sides, Guatemala last year
recognised Belize's independence. A final settlement will require further
steps, including ratification in a referendum in Belize and concessions to
guarantee Guatemala access through the Gulf of Honduras to the Caribbean.
These moves have allowed a lifting of the veto on Belize's membership of the
Organisation of American States, to which it acceded in January 1991. Belize
will also join the InterAmerican Development Bank in November.
The garrison still provides 8-10 per cent of the country's GDP, but its
departure will not necessarily mean an end to the British military presence.
As a training ground, Belize's jungle terrain is excellent.
A withdrawal would anyway have less economic impact now than in the past
thanks in large part to the growth of agriculture. Agriculture and
agro-processing account for a quarter of GDP, 40 per cent of employment and
nearly 70 per cent of exports. However, four-fifths of all Belize's exports
benefit from preferential market arrangements, some of which are threatened.
As a member of the Commonwealth, Belize exports to EC markets at low tariffs
under the Lome convention. Its agricultural products also have tariff-free
access to the US under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and the country
also belongs to the Caribbean common market, Caricom.
The North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico is
one threat. It may encourage Mexico to become a big citrus producer. A
further extension of US free trade agreements to other countries in Latin
America, proposed under President George Bush's Enterprise for Americas
Initiative, would also erode the special position of CBI countries.
According to Mr Ralph Fonseca, minister of state in the ministry of finance:
'The main tenet of our trade policy has been gradualism. We are saying give
us to the year 2000 and we can take on anybody.'
This approach recognises the country's still heavy dependence on a few
export products and its chronic trade deficits. Remittances from overseas -
estimated to bring in USDollars 15m to Dollars 17m a year - help balance
this. So does tourism, which has grown to become the country's second most
important source of foreign exchange.
Tourist attractions - rain forest, long expanses of coral reef and important
Mayan sites - have potential for further development. Belize has, however,
neither the desire, the labour force nor the beaches necessary to become a
mass tourist destination.
The country also provides a positive reception for foreign investment. There
are constraints such as a small labour force and mixed infrastructure: good
telephones but poor roads and no access for large ships. Electricity is
costly: 21 US cents per kilowatt-hour, almost three times that of the US.
It can also offer stability. Government handovers of power in 1984 and 1989
were achieved without big shifts in policy. The Belize dollar has been fixed
since 1976 at two to the US dollar and inflation has been low. The
government is fairly free of corruption. According to one businessman: 'The
worst thing you can say is that occasionally it favours its friends.'
However, the bureaucracy is often slow. One businessman describes it as
'expert in procrastination' and Mr Fonseca says the government recognises a
need to modernise it.
The government is also selling commercial assets. The telephone company has
been privatised, although the government retains a significant stake, and
plans to sell the electricity company are being finalised. The privatisation
programme has critics. Mr Manuel Esquivel, leader of the opposition, says
that it risks being dominated by one company: Belize Holdings, controlled by
Mr Michael Ashcroft, the controversial chairman of the British car auction
and security group, ADT.
The government has also attempted to speed up development by increasing
capital spending. This and its pay award to public sector workers of an
annual 10 per cent for the next three years have increased anxieties that
the government is forgetting its traditional fiscal conservatism.
Mr Keith Arnold, the central bank president, is worried that the
government's revenues are falling behind its spending: 'The government has
sufficient funds for the next two to three years, but beyond that it will
have to take care.'
This will accelerate talk of fiscal reform. Although legislation has been
passed to enable imposition of a value added tax, the government has been
reluctant to implement it. Yet the tax system is outdated: most revenue is
raised through taxing international trade.
The government also faces growing social problems. As migrants put pressure
on health and education services, emigration to the US is tearing at the
social fabric. Into this environment, cocaine has found its way. Belize has
resolved one drugs problem - in the 1980s it was one of the top five
suppliers of marijuana to the US; now most of the plantations have been
eradicated. But it has developed another: on a line between Colombia and the
US, Belize is used for cocaine trans-shipment. The Belizean middle men are
paid in kind and they have seen to it that a cocaine habit has developed. As
a result, crime, particularly in Belize City, is on the increase.
Yet, in spite of these problems, it is possible to be optimistic about the
future. With per capita income of USDollars 2,000 a year and a reasonable
income distribution, Belize is a richer and more just society than many of
its neighbours. Its institutions - its judicial, political and educational
systems - work reasonably well. As Mr Geoffrey Hart, manager of Barclays
Bank in Belize, says: 'This country is not going to be a Singapore. It's no
tiger but it has a lot going for it.'

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman reported 
yesterday on her participation in the 11th Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM] Ministerial Conference held recently in Cairo, Egypt. She 
explained that she had stopped the organization from accepting 
inaccurate proposals that attempted to obtain statements of 
support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize, 
thus, ignoring the existence of the territorial dispute. 
  Confronted with such attempts, her delegation acted to 
safeguard the country's interests and was able to get the NAM 
Declaration to be more balanced, limiting it to calling upon 
Belize and Guatemala to discuss and resolve the dispute, which 
had not been achieved at this forum previously. She asserted 
that the government agreed with the NAM statement because 
Guatemala's position had not been omitted. To the benefit of 
both parties, the declaration backed the negotiations and, by 
not polarizing the situation, established the necessary climate 
for it, she added. 
  She highlighted as special achievements her participation as 
vice president of the conference and Colombia's selection to 
chair the next NAM presidential summit of member countries to be 
held in 1998. Above all, we managed to get a special 
pronouncement in favor of Guatemala -- something that is 
uncommon -- to support the efforts being made by De Leon Carpio 
to further the democratization and peace processes, she 
emphasized. 
  On ending, Vielman stated that the officials who attended 
the 
NAM Ministerial Conference had attempted to redefine the 
movement's role in the new international context and had 
reaffirmed its objective of furthering the developing countries' 
struggle to advance. 
  The meeting was attended by 130 delegates, of which 109 were 
from member countries. We took advantage of this situation and 
held bilateral meetings with most of the representatives at the 
meeting, she added.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (7): Haven for refugees - The open door
policy is under strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER

<TEXT>
CENTRAL AMERICA's dirty wars have left Belize with one of the world's least
known refugee problems: Belize has absorbed in 10 years an influx of
foreigners equivalent to one-fifth of its population.
In most countries, this would have brought about a surge of resentment and
possibly riots. In Belize, in part because of its sparse population, it has
been viewed with equanimity. There are signs, however, that the early
tolerance to the newcomers is wearing thin, which has forced the government
to shift its laisser faire stance on the issue.
According to Mr Ismael Garcia, the country's ambassador to central America
and Panama, most of the migrants to Belize are from El Salvador, accounting
for perhaps 75 per cent of the estimated 30,000 to 40,000 foreigners who
have entered Belize to settle.
Some 20 per cent are from Guatemala, and the remainder from Honduras and
Nicaragua. Honduras used to provide the seasonal workers for agriculture in
Belize but the place of these transient workers has now largely been taken
by more permanent residents.
Mr Garcia said refugee cards are held by about 7,500 heads of households,
suggesting perhaps 20,000 people would be officially defined as refugees.
The children of other migrants born in Belize would also be entitled to
citizenship.
Belize has never established refugee camps, and refugees are free to move
across the country. Many take over land and set up small farms, a practice
generally tolerated by the government. However, relations between the
previous government and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees did
at times become tense. They have since relaxed, with the government signing
in 1990 the UN convention of 1951 and the 1967 protocol that governs
refugees' rights.
The pace of immigration has slowed since the peak years in the mid-1980s.
With the prospect of peace settling over central America, some migrants have
started to trickle home.
However, there is little doubt that the settlers are overstretching the
country's education and health services. At least 60-70 per cent of the
people using Belmopan's hospital, for example, are migrants. An estimated 90
per cent of the immigrants to Belize are illiterate and unskilled.
Even though the migrants are recognised as making an important contribution
to the growth of the agricultural sector in the last decade - taking jobs
for pay most Belizeans would not consider working for - there is a growing
sentiment that the newcomers are depriving Belizeans of jobs.
The government's recent statements have reflected this disquiet. The foreign
minister, Mr Said Musa, said in June: 'The time has now come for us to make
a clear distinction between those who are genuine refugees and those who are
economic migrants.' This policy aims at restricting entry of economic
migrants and enforcing the law concerning illegal aliens. Voluntary
repatriation will be encouraged.
The policy is, however, more easily stated than enacted. The border between
Belize and Guatemala is highly porous and difficult to police, and the
prospect of round-ups of 'illegal aliens' is not one the government
relishes.
However, economics will continue to make Belize attractive for most central
American peasants: farm workers can more than double the Dollars 4 a day
they earn in Guatemala. Neither do the population pressures in the other
countries exist in Belize.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (2): Dependence on agriculture - Many
factors outside the country's control influence the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELIZE faces an array of formidable short-term economic challenges.
Presenting this year's budget to parliament, Mr George Price, the prime
minister and finance minister, said: 'Not only is Belize a much more
developing nation today, but we have started the process of preparing for
the challenges of the 21st Century.'
Many of the factors influencing the economy are outside the country's
control. However, the country appears much more capable than many of its
neighbours of dealing with the uncertainties of economic change.
The foreign debt of Belize, for example, is comparatively light. The per
capita debt of Dollars 750 is less than half that of Jamaica to the east.
And Guatemala, to the west, carries a ratio of debt service to exports of 25
per cent, against Belize's 8 per cent.
Businessmen credit the present government and its predecessors with managing
the economy in an enlightened way.
Some aspects of economic policy have aroused trenchant debate, but there has
been remarkable consistency in spite of changes of administration.
Greater efficiency and economic expansion appear to be the common
objectives. The economy is narrowly based on agriculture and tourism.
Expansion in both sectors last year led to overall growth of 4.2 per cent.
Inflation was 5.6 per cent against three per cent in 1990.
Last year, the economy grew at only half the average rate of the previous
three years. Officials feel that this is preferable to the risk of
overheating by over-rapid growth or of the inflationary tendencies in
neighbouring countries.
The economy's biggest weakness is its lopsidedness, being dangerously
dependent on agriculture which accounts for a fifth of the gross domestic
product and three quarters of the country's export earnings.
Agriculture has three main supports - cane sugar, bananas and citrus - with
seafood emerging as a fourth pillar. This is the focus of the uncertainty of
which Mr Price speaks.
Belize depends on preferential access to food markets, all of which are
subject to the globalisation of international trade. It sells sugar under
quota to the European Community and the US. There is no immediate threat to
its EC sugar market, but the emergence of the North American Free Trade Area
has raised questions about continued access to the US being thwarted by
Mexico.
Belize's citrus concentrate market, mainly in Florida, has been developed
within the protection of a trade programme under which the US allows
countries in the Caribbean Basin to ship a range of products duty free.
Belizeans officials fear Mexican citrus will kill their market - the same
fear they express for the small garment sector.
There is even more uncertainty over Belize's sales of bananas in Europe
following the creation in January of the EC's single market. Belize, and the
other traditional suppliers in the Caribbean Basin, are trying to maintain
preferential access in the face of demands from Latin American exporters
that there should be open trading in the fruit.
Higher wages and other costs make Belizean bananas more expensive, and less
able to compete with cheaper Latin fruit. Mr Ralph Fonseca, the junior
finance minister, says that while Belize is worried about the impact of free
trade on its export markets, it is not against the principle of free trade.
'Belize can respond to the changes, but we need time,' says Mr Fonseca.
'There must be a gradualist approach to all of this or small countries such
as ours will not be able to survive.'
The dangers were illustrated last year when poor weather depressed citrus
and bananas, and the global recession cut the number tourists, contributing
to the slowdown in economic growth.
Efforts are being made to widen the base of the economy. However, this is
impeded by some fundamental infrastructural deficiencies such as lack of
energy. High energy costs, for example, are an obstacle to an expansion of
agro-industry and commerce. A Dollars 180m hydro-power station is under
construction which, it is hoped, will provide more power more reliably, and
eventually at cheaper rates.
This, with expansion of the new offshore financial services sector, plans
for attracting foreign investment in information services and data
processing, and Belize's potential for being an entrepot for Central America
with the coming end of the territorial dispute with Guatemala, promise some
relief from the often fickle traditional sectors of the economy.
There is also a controversial trend towards privatisation of state
enterprises. The government has sold off the public telecommunications
company, and also plans to privatise the electricity utility.
There is even a possibility the main port in Belize City will go on sale,
followed, at some stage, by the country's international airport.
Mr Price talks of a 'dynamic partnership' between government and the private
sector, in which the private sector gains a bigger role and the government
concentrates on managing those things which it has to do.
'Privatisation is part of a gradual move to liberalise the economy in
keeping with what is happening in the rest of the world,' says Mr Fonseca.
However, his enthusiasm is not shared by Mr Manuel Esquivel, the opposition
leader. 'People who see what the government is doing have realised that this
is not a genuine privatisation,' he says. 'The government appears to be
making these decisions without regard to the consequences and to public
opinion. The government has not yet brought itself to say publicly that
privatisation is the result of a correct policy to which it is committed.'
Much of the debate over privatisation centres on Mr Michael Ashcroft,
chairman of the UK/Bermuda ADT Group, and whose Belize Holdings ,registered
as an offshore company, is a large investor in the telecommunications
industry.
Businessmen say they would not be surprised if Belize Holdings also took a
significant share in the power company. 'Privatisation so far is a compact
between the government and one individual, Mr Ashcroft,' claims Mr Esquivel.
This is denied by Mr Fonseca who says: 'It was Mr Esquivel's administration
which invited Mr Ashcroft to invest in Belize.'
Deregulation is also evident in parts of the foreign exchange market where
commercial banks are allowed to settle some current payments. No such
latitude is being allowed over more fundamental matters such as the exchange
rate which has been fixed at BDollars 2 to the US dollar since 1976.
However, there are also danger signals. The deficit on visible earnings has
been widening and last year there was an overall balance of payments deficit
for the first time in seven years.
There is also concern at trends in the fiscal accounts. 'We are concerned
over revenue and expenditure,' says Mr Keith Arnold, governor of the Central
Bank. 'Revenue growth is not improving but there is expansion in
expenditure, especially for wages and salaries and capital expenditure.'
Yet even these indicators cause little overt alarm. The general feeling is
that Belize is doing well.
'Economically, we are not running, but we are crawling,' says Mr Barry
Bowen, a leading businessman. 'We are babies and we are just beginning to
learn how to move.'

  [Text] Belize City, Nov 25, CANA -- Belize and Mexico this 
week signed a memorandum of understanding on health. The 
memorandum relates to medical emergencies and high-complexity 
illnesses. 
  The memorandum was signed at the start of a meeting of 
health 
officials from Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. The memorandum 
states that the general hospital in Chetumal, Quintana Roo, 
Mexico will be made available to Belizeans who need emergency 
medical care. 
  Under the agreement, the health care for medical emegencies 
and high complexity pathologies to persons referred by the 
Belize Ministry of Health will be delivered according to the 
physical capacity of the general hospital. 
  Belizean patients, the memorandum stated, will be charged 
according to their socioeconomic capacity and will be 
responsible for costs and expenses incurred for lodging and 
boarding while being treated in Chetumal. Persons unable to pay 
for the medical attention would still have access to the 
treatment and the Mexican Governmnt would take on full 
responsibility for the payment of the treatment. 
  The Belizean and Mexican health officials agreed that if a 
Belizean patient cannot be attended at Chetumal's general 
hospital, he will be referred to other health facilities in the 
state of Quintana Roo or other hospitals in Mexico. 
  Speaking at the start of the meeting, Belize's prime 
minister, Manuel Esquivel, said his government's health policy 
recognises health as a basic human right and a fundamental part 
of the development process. 
  "The policy accepts that it is government's responsibility 
to 
ensure that every Belizean has access to the best level of 
health care available, appropriate for his or her health needs, 
regardless of ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status. and 
political or geographic distinctions," Esquivel said.

<F P=106> [Article by Ricardo Gatica Trejo] </F>
  [Text] It has been confirmed on-site that Guatemalan Army 
troops have been sent to the Peten-Belize border area where 
Belizean soldiers and civilians are harassing the Guatemalans 
who live there. 
  The small town of Rio Blanco in Dolores, Peten Department, 
is 
the one most seriously affected by these actions. The homes of 
the residents -- who are mostly Quekchi Indians from Alta 
Verapaz -- have been burned by the invaders. This situation is 
nothing new in this village that was settled 15 years ago. The 
pressure by Belizean troops, however, began nine years ago. 
According to Salvador Jimenez, a man from Jalapa who has been 
living in this village for 15 years, a black woman came to this 
village several weeks ago and threatened to leave them with 
nothing during the corn harvest. 
  Francisco Javier Chen, a young Quekchi Indian who is a 
community leader, added that the Belizean soldiers have told 
them they are inside Belizean territory and that if they remain 
there their homes, crops, and even their lives are at stake. 
  The village, on the banks of the crystal-clear waters of the 
Blanco River and a little further out than Chiquibul, seems to 
be like the garden of Eden. There is abundant agricultural 
production, the weather is very nice, and the river waters are 
fresh. One can hear the cry of the Saraguate monkeys in the 
distance. 
  Speaking in Quekchi, Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez 
Morales held a lengthy conversation with the residents of the 
Rio Blanco village in Dolores, Peten, who complained of the 
actions by the soldiers from Belize. Guatemalan peasants 
wearing ragged shirts and rubber boots came down nearby paths, 
as well as women who were wearing the native outfit from Alta 
Verapaz and adolescents who wore colorful necklaces and carried 
sweaty children. 
  Likewise, sweaty soldiers walked down the same paths. They 
were wearing dirty camouflage uniforms because they have been in 
the area for a long time. Some of them carried light artillery 
weapons. Others carried M-16 rifles, while another carried radio 
equipment. 
  Enriquez, speaking in their language, urged the peasants to 
respect the law and not cross the border. "The Army is here to 
give you a helping hand. If for any reason you have to abandon 
the area, the government will find land to give you," he said. 
  The peasants said that they "harm no one and work in their 
fields." On some occasions they said they have found tombs, but 
they never touch them. They always leave them where they are. 
They complained that the Belizean soldiers accuse them of 
"opening the Maya tombs, but this is not true." 
  The dialogue between Enriquez and the community leader was 
interrupted several times when 10 persons speaking at the same 
time explained that they "are Guatemalans and they hope their 
government will do something for them at this time -- the worst 
of their lives -- because there has never been anything like 
this before in the jungle." 
  The troops from Military Zone No. 23, stationed in Santa 
Elena but with jurisdiction in Peten Department, are arriving at 
the border area between this department and Belize.

<F P=106> [News conference by Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez </F>
with unidentified reporters on the agreement reached by the 
Guatemalan Government and the General Command of the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity, URNG, to create the Commission for 
Historical Clarification, CEH; place and date not given; 
broadcast in progress -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Enriquez] ...a historical event. As President 
Ramiro De Leon Carpio visited -- I believe -- the Roosevelt 
Hospital, he was asked the same question. I believe my reply 
will be the same. I must tell you that the Guatemalan 
Government's political resolve is shown once more. Reaching a 
full and lasting peace is our objective. We believe the work 
done by the government's peace delegation in Oslo was excellent. 
I congratulated them for their almost 15 days of hard work. I 
can tell you from experience that this type of work is 
exhausting. However, this work was not completed in vain, 
because we took two more steps toward achieving the peace we all 
desire. 
  [Reporter] Is the Army satisfied with the agreement reached 
by the government and Army representatives? 
  [Enriquez] I do not think any military members disagree with 
accepting and signing certain agreements. What we are doing 
here has national resonance, and those things that could affect 
the Army have institutional resonance. I refuse to believe 
someone will place his personal interests above national and 
general interests. As I said earlier, this situation does not 
prevail in the Army. Of course, there may be someone who is 
unsatisfied because it was once said that the Army would never 
hold talks with armed groups. This was even said at Esquipulas 
II. However, the Guatemalan Army is an institution that always 
respects the Army General Commander's mandates. On that 
occasion, it was said that there were going to be talks with 
subversives, and we held talks with them. There are even Army 
members currently holding talks with subversives. From the 
institutional and my personal point of view, I can tell you that 
the two agreements are good enough to lead to reconciliation and 
peace in Guatemala. 
  [Reporter] Have the objectives of the Guatemalan armed 
conflict been accomplished by creating this commission? You 
said on repeated occasions that there would not be an avenging 
commission? Could you.... 
  [Enriquez, interrupting] ....I believe you are completely 
right. We always said, even when I was a member of the Peace 
Commission, that the CEH [Commission for Historical 
Clarification], which was initially called the Truth Commission, 
did not intend to seek revenge. Its goal was to learn what 
really happened to ensure that new generations will not make the 
same mistakes and to prevent Guatemalan society from becoming 
polarized to the extreme of starting to kill each other again. 
These last 34 years have been very painful years of mourning, 
death, deception, and polarization. It has been a very long 
night for Guatemala; we now believe a dawn is coming for 
Guatemala. The CEH meets the equanimity, justice, and 
impartiality requirements, but, above all, the commission seeks 
no revenge. This is why the cases will not be handled 
individually, but collectively. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, what can be concluded from a number 
of recommendations made by General Victor Manuel Argueta 
Villalta? 
  [Enriquez] In reference to what? 
  [Reporter] In reference to his statement that those sectors 
that wanted to question him legally lacked moral authority. 
  [Enriquez] I think the Guatemalan Army, as a legitimate 
armed 
group established to defend the State, fulfilled completely its 
constitutional duties during these 34 years. All Guatemalans 
must be proud of the Guatemalan Army because thanks to this 
Army, this legendary Army with high morale but very poor 
resources, Marxist-Leninism was not established in Guatemala. 
  If it were not for the Guatemalan Army, we would now be 
regretting the establishment of Marxist-Leninism in Guatemala. 
Because of the Guatemalan Army, we have a better Guatemala. It 
is not as developed as it could have been if the subversives had 
not undermined progress in Guatemala. However, we anticipate a 
better Guatemala. We must all recognize that there is poverty 
in the country, and we must work to achieve better standards of 
living for all people. We, Guatemalans, must work to achieve 
this goal. We cannot sit around and wait for money and 
happiness to come from the heavens. We must all work harder and 
with greater integrity, tolerance, and understanding to attain a 
happy society in Guatemala. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, changing the subject, the human 
rights ombudsman has requested that the Army defend the 
sovereignty of Guatemala, which is being challenged by Belize. 
Will you do this? 
  [Enriquez] That is our duty. We will fulfill our 
obligations, but we also know Belizean reality and the reality 
of what is currently taking place. I know this reality first 
hand because I have traveled there, and if necessary, I will go 
there again. 
  There is no problem between Belize and Guatemala at this 
time. There are no definite borders; there is [word indistinct] 
between El Peten and Belize. This situation will have to be 
defined according to the recommendations made by this newly 
installed Belize Council, as stated by the foreign minister and 
the president. This Council will conduct a study and will make 
recommendations to the president on a referendum or popular 
consultation to end this territorial claim of Guatemala, which 
is recognized by Belize, England, and the world. 
  [Reporter] Meanwhile, what will the Guatemalan Army do about 
the threat from Belizeans to expel Guatemalans, whom you had a 
chance to visit, from the neighboring area? Is there Guatemalan 
Army presence there? 
  [Enriquez] We have soldiers there; there are also soldiers 
from the Belizean Army. We have talked to the Guatemalans 
residing there. They have not been forced to leave the area. 
We coordinated efforts with the INTA [National Institute of 
Agrarian Reform] president. The commander of Military Zone No. 
23 is aware of these efforts, and he was instructed to assist 
these people. But they will not be removed from the area. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct]? 
  [Enriquez] This cannot be done. That could create a more 
serious conflict in the area. 
  [Reporter] What will happen if the Belizean Army wants to 
expel these Guatemalans? This is our concern. 
  [Enriquez] My answer to that is the following: The chief of 
the Belizean Army spoke to [name indistinct] Rodriguez, and he 
told him that they were not interested in evicting these 
Guatemalans. He said that they should leave once they obtain 
land, that they will be offered transportation to move to their 
own land, and that they will not be moved from one place to the 
other. They will leave that area, which is an ecologically 
protected area. There is a Maya cemetery in the area. 
  [Reporter] In the meantime, you will not allow that they 
be... 
  [Enriquez, interrupting] Listen, our main duty is to protect 
our fellow citizens, and we will give our lives for our fellow 
citizens. You can rest assured of this. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, going back to the Truth Commission 
issue, people's sectors have expressed violence could increase 
while [words indistinct] is approved. What is the opinion of 
the Army? 
  [Enriquez] Well, the accords for the creation of the 
Commission were already approved and signed. 
  [Reporter] Yes, but these groups fear violence may increase 
before the Truth Commission begins operating. 
  [Enriquez] I know this Commission will begin working 
immediately after the final accord is signed.

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (8): Streams of history - Stephen Fidler
discusses the diverse ethnic mixture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO important developments are putting strains on the traditional harmonious
relations between Belize's diverse ethnic groups.
In the last decade, the country has absorbed between 30,000-40,000 migrants,
the equivalent of 20 per cent of its population, from elsewhere in central
America. Meanwhile, emigration to the US continues among Creoles, the group
that traditionally dominates the business and political elites.
These changes are having a profound impact on the country's economy and its
demographic make-up. The new settlers are putting pressure on the
overstretched hospital, social and education systems.
The ancestors of the Creole population carved out what in 1862 became the
colony of British Honduras from an Hispanic hinterland. But as a result of
the growing numbers of settlers, they fear that they are 'losing their
country' to Spanish speakers who form a majority of the population.
The migrants have, however, provided this sparsely-populated country with an
important resource, agricultural labour, which has underpinned the last
decade of growth. The Creoles have no tradition of agricultural work, partly
because they were discouraged from doing so by the British who were solely
interested in the region's logging potential, and prefer better-paying jobs
in management, transport and government.
Remittances from Belizeans in the US - amounting to an estimated Dollars
15m-17m a year, about 4 per cent of gross domestic product - also help to
balance the country's chronic trade deficit. But the emigration deprives the
country of many of the most promising products of its education system and
one-third of all Belizeans now live in the US.
Forty-four per cent of the population is under 15 years of age. A priority
for the government, according to the prime minister, Mr George Price, is to
encourage Belizeans to stay at home. But it will be a tough task. Just as
Belize's relative wealth provides an irresistible attraction to the poor
peasants of neighbouring Guatemala - Belize's per capita income is more than
double Guatemala's Dollars 900 a year - so the prospects of riches in the US
(whose per capita income is more than 10 times that of Belize) will continue
to lure Belizeans.
The country's main ethnic groups are as follows:
Creoles: this group now makes up slightly less than 30 per cent of the
population, according to the 1991 census, published this month. Speakers of
English and an English-derived patois, they are descendants of slaves
brought over from Jamaica and baymen, the British who settled around the Bay
of Honduras. They are concentrated around Belize City, where they make up
about 68 per cent of the population.
Mestizos: now the largest group, the mestizos account for just under 44 per
cent of the population, compared with 33.4 per cent who defined themselves
as of mixed blood in the previous census in 1980. This group, which speaks
Spanish as a first language, is largely descended from the mixed-blood
Mexicans and Mayan indians who fled Mexico in the 19th century. Their
numbers are being supplemented by more recent migrants, escaping conflict
and poverty in other parts of central America.
Garifunas: concentrated in the Stann Creek area to the south of Belize City,
the Garifunas are the descendants of mixed-blood Africans, Carib indians and
Europeans, who arrived in the area in the 19th century. Speaking English and
a language of their own, the Garinagu, as they call themselves, make up
about 6.6 per cent of the country's population, according to the 1991
census.
Mayans: people who define themselves as Indian or Mayan make up 14.6 per
cent of the population, according to the latest census. They are
concentrated in northern, western and southern Belize and form several
groups, some of whose languages are mutually incomprehensible. While an
effort is under way to preserve their culture, many are adopting Spanish or
English as a first language.
Mennonites: This group of fair-skinned Europeans began arriving from Mexico
and Canada in the late-1950s, seeking freedom of religion and freedom from
state interference. Concentrated in the north and north-west of the country
and retaining their German language, they make up 3.1 per cent of the
population. Easily recognised by the men's dark trousers and check shirts
and the women's long dresses and headscarves, the Mennonites have made
significant contributions to the country's agriculture.

The British government said yesterday it would begin pulling its troops out
of Belize this weekend, Reuter reports from Guatemala City.
The UK, which announced last May that it would end its 45-year military
presence in the former British colony, has about 1,350 troops there. By the
end of next September all but 50 will be gone, the government said in a
statement issued by the British embassy in Guatemala City. Those remaining
will run a jungle training school for British troops.
British troops have been stationed in Belize to counter possible aggression
from Guatemala, which claimed the country as its own until recognising
Belize's sovereignty in 1991. A border dispute continues but the British
government said the pull-out reflected confidence in improved relations
between the two countries.

Farce, rather than tragedy, from distant Athens. Ursula Barrow, Belize's
High Commissioner in London, was supposed to be there last week as an
observer to the 'San Jose ministerial', an annual binge where ministers from
the European Union and Central America talk about peace and stability.
Her presence less than delighted Guatemala's foreign minister, Gladys Ruiz
de Vielman. Guatemala still nurtures yearnings for Belizean territory;
Belize's privileged access to the EU banana market doesn't help much,
either.
Greek European Affairs minister Theodoros Pangalos, their host, first denied
he had invited Belize. Then he claimed the invitation had been withdrawn.
The Greek diplomat then tried to push her out of the group photograph and
hustle her out the meeting, while Britain's foreign office minister, David
Heathcoat-Amory, tried to stop him.
Yet again Greek diplomacy triumphed and Barrow left. In another age, such an
insult might have merited the dispatch of one of Her Majesty's gun boats.

  [Text] Melchor de Mencos, Peten -- As Belizean Prime 
Minister Manuel Esquivel broadens his anti-Guatemala campaign, 
Army troops of that former colony are patrolling the border area 
and warning Peten families not to enter their territory. 
  More than 3,000 Belizean soldiers are maintaining permanent 
surveillance along the alleged [supuesta] borderline. In fact, 
they built a wide highway that allows them to move easily from 
Cayo San Ignacio to Corozal, which is near the area that borders 
Peten. 
  It was reported that soldiers from the former colony 
frequently enter Peten territory and that they even harass 
peasants who have lived and worked there for many years. 
  Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel has started an 
anti-Guatemalan 
campaign and ordered the expulsion of numerous families with 
years of residence in the territories under dispute although 
many of them already filed requests before the immigration 
authorities to reside legally in Belize. 
  In order to win support within the Belizean community, 
Esquivel maintains a hostile attitude toward Guatemalans and 
points out that there could be an invasion anytime. 
  In a recent meeting with Queen of England Elizabeth II, 
Esquivel advised the sovereign on the need to maintain English 
troops in the former colony, but his efforts were unsuccessful. 
The monarch, however, assured him that the British will use the 
Belizean jungle as a training ground for some soldiers. 
  Peten authorities in Melchor de Mencos said that Guatemala 
maintains minimal surveillance along the border and this could 
facilitate new incursions by Belizean soldiers. They added that 
more than 3,000 Guatemalans have been expelled since Esquivel 
became Belizean president, although his grandparents hail from 
San Miguel, a town across from the Island of Flores. Esquivel 
also admitted that he has relatives residing in Santa Elena (a 
Peten community) but has never met them. The authorities noted 
that his hostile attitude toward Guatemalans is inexplicable.

  [Text] After it was confirmed that Belizean troops had 
entered Guatemalan territory, yesterday, Army spokesperson Major 
Edith Vargas de Marroquin reported that the Army is prepared to 
defend the country militarily. Nevertheless, Vargas said this 
problem must first be solved politically and that the Guatemalan 
Foreign Ministry has started to take specific actions to this 
end. "The defense minister visited the area and listened to the 
local residents' complaints and fears. He told them the Army is 
prepared to defend them, as it is its responsibility," she said. 
  According to the Army's official version, the problem is 
that 
there is no definite border between Guatemala and Belize. This 
has not led to an armed confrontation between the two armies, 
however, the source said. Maj. Vargas reported that the 
Guatemalan and Belizean troops stationed along the border area 
hold "peaceful" relations and avoid incidents. 
  It has been reported from Peten that combined British and 
Belizean troops continue to harass and intimidate hundreds of 
peasant families living in the area. The source added that 
these two armies have used sophisticated equipment, such as the 
Harrier plane, specially designed for heavy fighting. 
  On Tuesday, the peasants intimidated by these actions 
presented to the Human Rights Ombudsman's Office a petition 
reporting that foreign troops had entered their communities to 
evict them and seize their property. Sebastian Tux, leader of 
the affected communities, told this newspaper that Belizean 
soldiers arrived at their homes and ordered them to leave 
because the territory belonged to Belize.

   The first of a string of Central American
``peace parks'' intended to save critical wilderness areas and end
decades-old border disputes has been launched in Costa Rica and
Panama, officials said Wednesday.
   The park has been established in the misty mountains of the La
Amistad Biosphere Reserve, which includes the largest tract of
undisturbed cloud forest in Central America.
   The reserve straddles the border of Costa Rica and Panama. As
many as 40 percent of its plants and animals are found nowhere else
on Earth.
   So far, 115 fish species, 215 reptiles and amphibians and at
least 500 bird species have been found there.
   Similar parks are on the drawing board for a forest that
overlaps the border of Belize and Guatemala and for the Maya
Biosphere Reserve that includes parts of Mexico and Guatemala.
   A third is planned for an area along the Costa Rica-Nicaragua
border, said James Nations, director of the Latin American program
of Conservation International, a private environmental organization
in Washington, D.C.
   ``The idea is to defuse the border conflict by creating an
international peace park in an area that was formerly the haunt of
the Contras,'' said Nations.
   ``What we're doing is looking for regional solutions to regional
problems.''
   Central America has more different species of plants and animals
than any comparably sized region on Earth, according to
Conservation International. It is one-eighteenth the size of the
United States, but has just as many plant species and twice as many
vertebrates.
   Nations said Conservation International and the Organization of
American States have just completed a management plan for the Costa
Rican side of the peace park.
   The plan specifies steps that must be taken to protect the park,
including projects to improve the well-being of the park's
residents.
   ``If you allow those people to produce the income they need,
they won't need to move across the hillsides destroying the
tropical forests their lives depend on.''
   ``It is the first time the original residents of the region are
being treated as equals in deciding how land and resources will be
managed,'' said Hernan Seguro, a Bribri Indian and a representative
to the park's coordinating commission.
   The proposed peace park along the Guatemala-Belize border
exemplifies the importance of international cooperation in
preserving ecosystems, he said.
   The border is criss-crossed by the Chiquibul River, which begins
in Belize, runs through Guatemala and then dumps into Belize's San
Ignacio Valley, an agricultural area that supplies most of Belize's
food.
   ``What happens to that river when it's in Guatemala is vitally
important to Belize,'' he said. ``If you can get the two countries
talking to protect that forest, you've done something positive for
both countries.''

  [Text] Guatemala City, 21 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Belizean troops 
have raided Guatemalan territory, demanding peasants from this 
country abandon their lands in the northern border areas, local 
Guatemalan authorities charged today. 
  "The soldiers gave us a 15-day deadline to fall back; or 
otherwise suffer the consequences," said Carlos Ovando, mayor of 
the Guatemalan hamlet of Los Dolores in northern Peten 
Department. The official told the Guatemalan Congress that 
Belizean soldiers threatened to kill the peasants in the area if 
they remain in the border region. Ovando asked for the 
Guatemalan Government's intervention to exercise greater control 
along the border in light of what he labeled a Belizean invasion. 
  Last year in October, the Guatemalan Defense Ministry 
confirmed that Belizean soldiers had raided Guatemalan territory 
on several occasions; however, the Belizean Government ruled out 
an "erosion" of diplomatic relations. On 16 February, residents 
of the De Melchor de Mencos municipality in Peten, approximately 
10 km north of here, charged that soldiers from the neighboring 
nation had entered Guatemalan territory, destroying maiz and 
rice fields. 
  Guatemala maintains -- since the time Belize was a British 
colony -- a demand on this territory that gained its 
independence from the United Kingdom in 1971.

FT  18 APR 92 / Travel: Journey by Batty Bus to whimsical Belize - The
easy-going ways of the Belizean reefs and cays entirely to his liking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORING OVER the pages of an atlas not long ago, I came across a country that
I immediately wanted to visit for no reason other than its names. It is a
tiny place, not much more than a spot on the map, but its names filled my
imagination.
Only a complete cynic could fail to see happy portents in the likes of Bound
To Shine and More Tomorrow. But what of ominous places like Pull-Trouser
Swamp, Burnt House, Go To Hell Camp? Would you prefer to live in Gallon Jug,
Baking Pot, or Tea Kettle? Imagine life on Dog Flea Cay - perhaps Cockroach
Cay would suit you better. What is Saturday night like in Dancing School
Eddy?
Any country with such whimsical and outlandish names, I thought, must be
worth a visit. It is. Belize is a whimsical, outlandish and satisfying
place.
While Belize has at least in theory taken its place among the modern,
independent and responsible nations of this world, I am not so sure it has
caught up with this world, or is even entirely part of it. The whole country
seems dottily misplaced. It functions, but in a wacky, improvised way. This
became apparent as soon as I stepped on to a Belizean bus in Chetumal, a
border town in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.
To begin with, no one in his right mind who owns a bus company, even if his
surname is Batty, names it the Batty Bus Company. Nor does anyone normally
press a brand new, low-slung, low-geared city bus, the kind with seats
facing each other and straps for hanging, into long-haul service on tropical
jungle highways; it does not stay new for long.
Nonetheless, off we set on the Batty Bus to Belize City, the motor howling
as the driver put his foot to the floor and roared through the mangrove
swamps at 30 mph.
Not even the musical choice on board was entirely sane. Gone were the hot
and excited Latin rhythms one finds blaring over the speakers of Mexican
buses. Instead, whining our way southward through the muggy December
afternoon, we were accompanied by Bing Crosby in a mellow medley of
Christmas songs. 'Chestnuts roasting on an open fire . . . ', crooned Crosby
as we ground past coconut plantations and sweated into our shirts.
Not only the music, but my fellow passengers, too, seemed out of place. Here
we were in the heart of central America. To the north lay Mexico's Yucatan
peninsula, to the east Guatemala, to the south Honduras and El Salvador. For
1,000 miles in every direction this was an Hispanic region, a world of brown
skins, rapid Spanish inflections and excitable Latin temperaments.
Yet the people riding with me were more than a little relaxed, black, and
speaking English. Like a foreign ship aground, Belize seems to have drifted
into central America by accident, become stuck, and never left.
My impressions were only reinforced in Belize City, a place which, with
50,000 people, holds about one-third of the nation's population. If Belize,
the country, is a ship aground, Belize the city is already breaking up and
sinking.
Built on a swamp at the mouth of a sluggish creek, it stands only 18 inches
above sea level. Hot, steamy and odorous, flooded when rainy and
mosquito-ridden when windless, it seems just the place not to choose to
build a city. So unsuitable is it that the Belizean government has installed
itself in distant Belmopan. Ministers and bureaucrats are now lost far in
the jungles of the interior - at last safe, however, from the hurricanes
that periodically devastate the coast.
In an age of urban modernisation and blandness, Belize City has a certain
swash-buckling, picaresque appeal. There is little that is up-to-date,
well-maintained or efficient in it. Even the Mayan ruins rising from jungle
clearings in the interior seem better preserved. Its wooden houses and
shops, perched on stilts to avoid the worst humidity, are slowly crumbling.
Every year their clapboard sides grow more weather-beaten and peeled, their
tin roofs more rust-stained. What is the earthly fruit of man's vaunting
ambition? In the heat, dampness, corrosion and rot of Belize, not a great
deal.
In fact, if it were not for a certain Baron Bliss, an English
philanthropist, Belize City would have lost count of time altogether and
receded back into the primordial ooze. In a long history of colonial neglect
under the British crown, Bliss appears the only one to have cared for the
fate of Belize.
Today the city's most notable landmarks are the results of his beneficence -
the Bliss Institute, the Bliss school of nursing, the Bliss promenade, the
Bliss airport transit lounge, the Bliss lighthouse and the Bliss memorial
are only some of them. There is, naturally, a national Bliss Day every year
to celebrate the baron's generosity.
Belize's own home-grown vitality, if it exists anywhere, reposes in its
people, a true salad of genes. Hacked out of virgin forest nominally under
Spanish control, the country was in large part populated by African slaves
brought in to work British timber concessions.
But the English 'Baymen' and their black slaves were just part of the mix of
the colony then known as British Honduras. There were also indigenous Maya
Indians, Carib tribes from the seas to the east, immigrant Mexicans,
Garifunas - the offspring of Caribs and escaped slaves - indentured East
Indians and Mennonite settlers from Switzerland. Walk down a street in
Belize City today and you might find yourself as culturally confused as the
people who live there.
Where, in this great tropical hodge-podge, does the visitor to Belize find
his place? You might - like the British army units which still come to
post-independence Belize - practise jungle warfare deep in the interior
until you were destroyed by mosquitos. You could waste away in the bars of
Belize City until you were mugged by Rastafarians. Or, like most visitors,
you could head out to the cays for one of the most idyllic marine holidays
it is possible to enjoy anywhere.
Just a mile or two off the Belize coast lies the longest coral reef in the
western hemisphere, 250 kms of warm, crystal-clear Caribbean water,
colourful submarine life and the scattered small green islands known as
cays.
It is here that the Belizean penchant for relaxed, makeshift living reaches
the level of genius. You need not be efficient, time-conscious or even
vaguely formal on the cays. Such anti-social behaviour is even frowned upon
as a cramp to the island style of life - witness the sign on the wall of
most cay bars and restaurants: 'No shirt, no shoes, no problem.'
I spent a few days on Cay Caulker, a mile-long island an hour from Belize
City by fast boat. It is delightful. There is nothing out there to tax even
the most stressed brain. The soothing effect of living with sky, water,
leafy green island and not much else is immediate.
Suddenly, everyone begins enjoying life. Like Jack and Jake, a couple of
dried-out septuagenarian New York wise-crackers I met, you can spend all day
drinking rum punch and fishing for tarpon. Or, like Wendy, a Labour council
housing manager from London, you can put scuba tanks on your back, get away
from all those people, and sort out schools of fish instead. My own choice
was to spend long breezy days on Miss Conduct, a 32-ft wooden sailing boat
which, shared with three other people, cost me just Dollars 7 a day.
Lugging along beside the reef under patched canvas sails and a warm sun, it
seemed to me there was not much more one could ask from life. When we were
hungry we dropped anchor and fished for snapper. If we wanted lobster or the
firm white meat of the conch shell, we dived down and hunted for it. If we
felt like doing nothing, we did.
The easy-going ways of the cays are quickly adopted. In no time I felt
myself turning soft and lazy. One morning I told myself it was time to leave
Caulker and hurry back to the real world. But that evening, when the boat
returned, I met a bare-footed woman fishing from the dock. 'How many are you
going to catch', I asked as she pulled in three fish. She could have caught
a dozen, or six dozen, if she had wanted.
'Just enough for tea', she said. 'Fish always impatient to get caught.' She
coiled her hook and line. 'Don't do them no good, though.'
I thought that over. I would stay a little longer. The Batty Bus back to the
real world could wait.
There are no direct flights from the UK to Belize. Nicholas Woodsworth flew
to Belize City via Miami with American Airlines, which offers a return fare
of Pounds 508.
One reason why Belize tourism remains relatively undeveloped is its
capital's reputation for drug-related street crime, and care should be
exercised. Happily, such provisos apply only to Belize City.
There is not a great deal of travel literature on Belize. Perhaps the best
guide is the Belize Handbook, from Moon Publications.

  [Excerpts] Guatemala City, 12 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today said Central America will 
present joint proposals at the Fourth Ibero-American summit. 
The proposals will deal with sustained development, ecological 
defense, and the review of the Cuban and Haitian cases. 
  The Central American countries "are taking a joint proposal 
on the urgent need to form an alliance for sustained development 
in the region and ecological defense, which we hope the rest of 
the Ibero-American nations will join," De Leon Carpio said. 
  The president traveled to San Jose, Costa Rica, at 1430 
[2030 
GMT] to meet with his Central American counterparts to adopt a 
united position on these topics. De Leon expressed optimism 
about the positive results of the Ibero-American Summit to be 
held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14-15 June. 
  He added that the meeting of government leaders from Belize, 
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and 
Panama, which begins today and ends tomorrow in San Jose, has 
the primary objective of establishing a "common front" for the 
defense of the region's interests. 
  Guatemalan Foreign Ministry sources told NOTIMEX that during 
the Cartagena summit the presidents will sign a document on the 
importance that greater trade integration has for the 
hemisphere's economies. A diplomat indicated that during the 
Ibero-American Summit the Central American presidents want to 
meet with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera to discuss a free trade agreement 
between those two countries and Central America. [passage 
omitted] 
  De Leon also said the Central American presidents will 
propose the review of the current crises in Haiti and Cuba. The 
Guatemalan president said that in Cuba's case, the island's 
return to the OAS must be conditioned on respect for human 
rights. 
  The president expressed concerned over the Haitian 
situation, 
indicating that the current economic blockade has been 
insufficient to restore a democratic regime and that, in 
addition, the threat of a military invasion is looming over 
Haiti. The violence in the Haitian capital due to the 
international sanctions against General Raoul Cedras' regime 
"greatly worries us, and we must seek effective solutions," De 
Leon added.

THE Guatemalan government yesterday moved to tighten its control over the
country, a day after President Jorge Serrano suspended the constitution and
closed down congress and the supreme court.
Although Mr Serrano said early on Tuesday that his move would not affect
freedom of expression, the government was yesterday controlling radio and TV
broadcasts. It has sent censors to monitor newspapers, while police
surrounded the offices of the two largest morning papers.
Opposition to Mr Serrano's action came at home and abroad. Mr Mario
Solorzano, the minister of labour and a vice-president of Socialist
International, resigned in protest at the moves.
He said the president had removed the possibility of reaching peace in
Guatemala and believed it would no longer be possible for international
financial institutions to continue support for the government.
The constitutional court, the highest judicial body in Guatemala, declared
the president's actions invalid.
The US put its Dollars 67m (Pounds 43.5m) aid programme to Guatemala under
review, the State Department said, but did not say if the aid was suspended.
Foreign ministers of the Organisation of American States are expected to
meet in Washington on June 3 over Guatemala, following condemnation of the
move by the US and almost all Latin American states, except for Peru.
A suspension of lending from international financial institutions could
follow the OAS meeting.
Mr Serrano, whose action is seen as emulating Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori's so-called 'self-coup' in April 1992, said he was thinking of
telephoning Mr Fujimori.
The government has a 15-month standby arrangement with the International
Monetary Fund which started last December, although the government has not
drawn the Dollars 54m available under the programme. Loans for the country
from the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank, which has
Dollars 110m of loans awaiting approval in the second half of the year,
could be jeopardised.
Soldiers yesterday surrounded the offices of a large union umbrella group.
Mr Alberto Villar, a committee member, said that his members would discuss
the possibility of calling a nationwide protest.
The human rights ombudsman, Mr Ramiro de Leon Carpio, came out of hiding to
protest at the move.
'The president doesn't have constitutional, legal or moral rights to take
the measures he did,' he told journalists. He called on different sectors of
society to put pressure on the regime to reverse its measures.
The British Foreign Office said the events in Guatemala had not led the
government to rethink its decision to remove its garrison of 1,400 troops in
neighbouring Belize.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Peace prize puts Guatemala on spot: Nobel award is just one
more problem for President Serrano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE award this month of the Nobel Peace Prize to one of the most vociferous
opponents of the Guatemalan government has added to an array of problems
faced by President Jorge Serrano.
The government has been sharply criticised for its handling of the award to
Ms Rigoberta Menchu, a human rights activist and an energetic critic of
successive Guatemalan governments since she fled to Mexico in 1981,
following the death of her father, mother, and brother at the hands of the
armed forces.
The government, seemed tobe caught unprepared, and was quickly forced into
an embarrassing U-turn. Days after several prominent government officials
publicly stated their opposition to the award, President Serrano scrambled
to invite her for a meeting in the National Palace, minutes before she left
for Mexico where President Carlos Salinas had organised an official
celebration.
This is the latest in a series of difficulties for Mr Serrano, which has
left his government isolated and has pushed him closer to the powerful armed
forces.
Twenty-one months into his term, the president has failed to deliver the
peace he promised in his election campaign: to end 32 years of armed
conflict. Negotiations between the government and the left-wing National
Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity guerrillas (URNG) have stalled on the issue
of human rights, the first point of an 11-point agenda agreed in Oslo 18
months ago.
The president's initiative to recognise Belize, which the Guatemalan
constitution states is part of Guatemala, continues to be blocked pending a
Supreme Court decision on whether his action was constitutional.
While most Guatemalans have little interest in the Belize issue, most
leading newspapers have attacked the government for its handling of the
matter.
Two weeks earlier the human rights performance of the armed forces had been
criticised by a United Nations expert on Guatemala. A German professor,
Christian Tomushcat said that the presidential staff was 'totally
discredited' over its stance on the killing of Guatemalan anthropologist, Ms
Myrna Mack, whose death has become Guatemala's most prominent human rights
case. Ms Mack's sister has called for a case to be opened against General
Edgar Augusto Godoy, chief of presidential staff at the time of her sister's
death two years ago.
Mr Serrano has turned increasingly to the army for support, as an antidote
to an unreliable congress, and a coalition cabinet which has lost the
semblance of unity.
The influence of the army grew significantly after it took over security in
Guatemala City following a widespread bombing campaign in April and May,
believed to be the work of right-wing extremists and drug traffickers.
The Nobel prize is being seen by some as a chance to elicit change in the
attitude of a political and economic establishment which has largely
marginalised and repressed Guatemala's majority indigenous tribal
population.
'It was a shock to the upper crust of our society . . . which was needed for
people to finally realise some realities of this country,' Mr Edmond Mulet,
congress president, said.
For the indigenous population Ms Menchu's victory is being seen as a chance
for greater political participation and recognition of their culture.

MORNING BRIEFING: THESE CUB FANS HAVE SAID IT ALL ALONG: YOU GOTTA BELIZE

It's not exactly a cargo cult, but William Branigan of the Washington Post 
reports that residents of the Central American country of Belize are going 
bonkers for the Chicago Cubs: 
</P>
<P>
"Through a quirk of geography and satellite technology, Belize has more Cub 
fans per capita than any place outside greater Chicago, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
"It started in 1981, when local businessman Arthur Hoare introduced television 
to Belize (population 180,000), the only English-speaking country in Central 
America. Many Belizeans already had television sets by then, but used them to 
watch rented videotapes. The enterprising Hoare capitalized on the ready market 
by launching Channel 9, which captured Chicago's WGN station on a satellite 
dish and relayed it to local viewers." 
</P>
<P>
Then aren't the broadcasts pirated? 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. broadcasters consider the Belize market so small that trying to stop the 
operations would not be worth the trouble." 
</P>
<P>
According to Branigan, Belizeans take the view that, as one resident put it, 
"Out of the sky we get sunshine, we get rain and we get TV signals. Whatever 
drops out of the sky is an act of God." 
</P>
<P>
Crying wolf: Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, once known for his quick wit, has 
developed a new image -- that of a hand-wringing poor-mouth. 
</P>
<P>
After his top-ranked Irish had defeated Michigan State Saturday, Holtz moaned 
about Notre Dame's next opponent, Purdue. It was his understanding, Holtz said, 
that the Boilermakers had beaten Notre Dame whenever the Irish were reigning 
national champions. Sorry, Lou, no sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
KMPC radio's Jim Healy, based on research by sports expert Dwain Esper, 
informed his audience Monday night that in nine seasons after Notre Dame 
championships, Purdue has won three times, the Irish have won three and three 
times the teams didn't play. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Sept. 27, 1936, what future Dodger manager played in his only 
major league game? 
</P>
<P>
Strictly business: The Boston Red Sox unceremoniously made it clear Monday that 
former stars Jim Rice, 36, and Bob Stanley, 34, won't be in Red Sox uniforms 
next year. Both are in final years of long-term contracts that included club 
options for 1990. Rice earns $2.34 million for this season, Stanley $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the Red Sox plan to do with the money they save on the contracts, 
General Manager Lou Gorman told Steve Buckley of the Hartford Courant: "A lot 
of it will go to Mr. Esasky, if we can sign him." 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Nick Esasky will become a free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Walter Alston, as a late-inning substitute at first base for 
Johnny Mize of the St. Louis Cardinals. Alston made one error in two chances 
and struck out in his only time at bat. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Chicago Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray, on the possibility of the 
club's winning the National League East title while playing in Montreal: 
'There's something un-American about clinching a pennant in a foreign country."

FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (11): Beautiful, multi-faceted jewel - The
country's 450 cayes are a paradise for scuba divers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD JOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATION and tourism have become almost synonymous in Belize. Mr Glenn
Godfrey, minister of tourism, calls the country a beautiful, multi-faceted
jewel.
It boasts the longest barrier reef in the western hemisphere, and has 450
beautiful cayes which are a paradise for snorkellers and scuba divers. It
also has some of the best preserved rain forests in the world in spite of
extensive logging, as well as the beautiful Mayan mountains and their
archaeological remains.
Government tourism policy does not aim at large-scale ritzy developments
such as Mexico's Cancun and Ixtapa but smaller-scale projects, where
possible under Belizean ownership and retaining maximum added value for the
country while respecting its traditional, eccentric social fabric.
The commitment to conservation has developed in a fairly haphazard,
incoherent way. Foreign institutions have played a significant role - most
notably the World Life Conservation International, an offshoot of the New
York Zoological Society. Nationally, the driving force has been the Belize
Audebon Society.
US conservationists are concerned about birds which emigrate north. Experts
believe Belize may have as many as 500 species, many of which are
endangered.
Individuals have also played a big part in conservation projects. Alan
Rabinovitch's fanatical and hair-raising research on jaguars and determined
lobbying led to the establishment of the Cockscomb basin wildlife reserve
where up to 100 are believed to survive.
Another notable contributor has been Dr Robert Horwich who helped establish
the somewhat inaptly named Community Baboon Sanctuary devoted to the
threatened Black Howler monkey.
He has also assisted in resettling the primates at Cockscomb where they were
wiped out by yellow fever and Hurricane Hattie.
The Programme for Belize, funded with foreign donations, now has 200,000
acres under management in the Rio Bravo area. Coca Cola Foods donated 92,000
acres having purchased the land from Mr Barry Bowen, a leading entrepreneur.
The company renounced plans to plant citrus there after German
conservationists objected.
In turn, Mr Bowen, has cleared only 2,200 acres of his magnificent jungle
territory, leaving another 130,000 virgin for the cause and adjoining the
Rio Bravo estate. At the last official count Belize had 33 reserves under
varying degrees of protection and management totalling 2.2m acres or about a
quarter of the country's territory.
'Everyone has been encouraged by the reaction of the public,' says Mrs Janet
Gibson, who is assisting the fisheries department in drawing up the coastal
zone management plan.
Developments on the coastal strip are threatening a vital eco-system
including the mangroves with their capacity to contribute to fisheries. They
cover an estimated 80 per cent of the shoreline. The fate of the manatee, or
sea cow, and other marine creatures, are also at stake. Ambergris is the
main tourist centre but it is overpriced and has serious water and sewage
problems. A plan to increase its potential is about to be submitted to the
cabinet.
Belize's small population is probably the main reason why it remains an
environmental paradise. However, this could be threatened by demographic
changes, which may result from the arrival of some 40,000 Guatemalan and
Salvadorean refugees.
They, like the indigenous Mayans (about 11 per cent of the population),
practise slash-and-burn agriculture while shooting and eating monkeys and
parrots.
Devising ways of tapping timber resources without wholesale destruction of
forests is also a problem. So, too, is finding the manpower resources to
police the reserves.
For the time being, therefore, it may be advantageous that the country's
tourist infrastructure remains relatively undeveloped.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, Jan. 27 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan 
will change his itinerary and visit the Bahamas after winding up 
his trip in Honduras Friday [28 January], Jason Hu, 
director-general of the Government Information Office, said 
Thursday. 
  Lien originally planned to leave Tegucigalpa Friday and 
return home via San Francisco. 
  The Bahamas, however, had been keen to have Lien visit while 
he was in Latin America, and so Lien agreed to a one-day 
stopover, according to Chang Ping-nan, the ROC ambassador to the 
Bahamas. 
  Lien and his 17-member entourage attended the inauguration 
of 
new Honduran President Carlo Roberto Reina on Thursday. The 
ceremony was held at Tegucigalpa National Stadium and lasted 
four hours. 
  Lien later met with Nicaraguan President Violeta de 
Chamorro. 
He greeted Chamorro on behalf of President Li Teng-hui and 
expressed his appreciation for Nicaragua's support of the ROC in 
the international community. 
  Nicaragua and six other Latin American countries submitted a 
letter to United Nations Secretary-General Butros Butros-Ghali, 
asking that the ROC's UN bid be put on the agenda for the 
General Assembly in September. The request was later voted 
downed. 
  Chamorro said that she was honored to be able to speak up 
for 
the ROC in the international community and said she would 
continue to do so. She also invited Li and Lien to visit 
Nicaragua. 
  Lien also met briefly with Belize President Manuel Esquival 
and Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. Esquival 
expressed the hope that relations between Belize and the ROC 
could be cemented. He also said that Belize's vice premier and 
foreign minister will visit the ROC soon.
