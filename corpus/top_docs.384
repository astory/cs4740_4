<LEADPARA>  John Bardeen, a co-inventor of the transistor that led to modern electronics
and twice a winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, died Wednesday at Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 82.;    Bardeen, a professor emeritus
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, was a patient at the
hospital when he suffered a heart attack, said Larry Bernard, a university
spokesman.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A soft-spoken theoretical physicist, Bardeen was working with two other
scientists, Walter Brattain and William P. Shockley, at Bell Laboratories in
Murray Hill, N.J., when they developed the first semiconductor transistor in
1947.;    The invention was announced in June 1948, and its first commercial
use was in telephone-switching equipment four years later.;    Invention of
the transistor earned the three men a Nobel Prize in 1956 and transformed
science and industry. The tiny devices on silicon chips pushed aside the
large, inefficient vacuum tubes for portable radios, computers and the
miniaturized electronics required for space flight.;    Bardeen once remarked,
"I knew the transistor was important, but I never foresaw the revolution in
electronics it would bring.";    Bardeen was the last surviving member of the
team responsible for the invention. Brattain died in 1987, and Shockley, in
1989.;    In 1951, Bardeen joined the University of Illinois faculty and soon
began the research that made him the first person to receive two Nobel Prizes
in the same field. His development of a theory of low-temperature
superconductivity, in which electricity travels with little or no resistance,
helped researchers develop technologies for magnetic imaging systems for
medical diagnosis and made it possible to devise alloys that become
superconducting at less extreme temperatures. He considered the
superconductivity theory his greatest scientific achievement.;   
"Superconductivity was more difficult to solve, and it required some radically
new concepts," he said.;    His work on superconductivity was done with two
graduate students, Leon Cooper, now at Brown University, and J. Robert
Schrieffer, now at the University of California, Santa Barbara. They shared
the Nobel Prize in physics in 1972.;    The morning the second prize was
announced, Bardeen almost missed a champagne celebration in his honor because
of a misbehaving spinoff of his first prize-winning invention. He was unable
to get his electronically controlled garage door to open.;    Bardeen was born
May 23, 1908, in Madison, Wis., the son of a dean of the medical school at the
University of Wisconsin. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in
electrical engineering at the university and, after working three years as a
geophysicist at Gulf Research Laboratories in Pittsburgh, earned a doctorate
in mathematical physics at Princeton University in 1936.;    Later he held a
fellowship at Harvard University, taught at the University of Minnesota and
was a physicist with the Naval Ordinance Laboratory during World War II. After
the war, he joined Bell Laboratories as a researcher. From 1951 until his
retirement in 1975, he was a professor of electrical engineering and physics
at the University of Illinois.;    Two years ago, Sony Corp. endowed a $3
million faculty position at Illinois in Bardeen's honor. Michael P. Schulhof,
vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, said, "Sony's achievements, from
Japan's first transistor radio to the latest digital processors, owe a
significant debt to the scientific contributions of Professor Bardeen."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Harold W. Schaefer, an inventor and
former president of Eureka Co., the vacuum cleaner manufacturer,
died Monday at age 79, company spokesmen said.
   An electrical engineer and the holder of more than 100 patents,
Schaefer joined Eureka in 1962 and served as president and director
until his retirement in 1980.
   The Chicago native, born Feb. 16, 1909, worked as a young man
for Chicago-based Majestic Radio, where he invented a power supply
system considered an important component in the development of the
radio industry.
   From 1941 to 1943, he served as director of engineering and
manufacturing for the applied physics laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, where he worked on projects for the U.S.
Office of Scientific Research and Development.
   In 1943, Schaefer became manager of facilities planning and
radio and television product development for RCA Corp., but he left
the following year to become division manager in charge of
engineering, manufacturing and product development for the
Westinghouse Electric Corp.
   Schaefer joined Philco in 1950 as vice president and director of
engineering of consumer and commercial products and later became
general manager of the appliance division.
   Schaefer is survived by his wife Mary and a son, Harold.

lots of "impulse" items at the checkout register. Add kiosks with electronic
catalogs, so customers can go right to the video to see and print out
information about parts and products.;   Such are the seeds of a new Radio
Shack as the nation's most widespread retailer of electronics tries to end two
years of sliding sales and remake itself into a growth company with some
luster.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  RADIO SHACK SIGNALS A CHANGE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "They're trying to rejuvenate the chain," said Dennis Van Zelfden, an
analyst with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. in Dallas. "The chain suffers from a
lackluster image.";   The Fort Worth-based firm has begun to tinker with its
bread-and-butter recipe of selling only house-brand electronics in lots of
small stores. In a series of wide-ranging experiments that may increase in
frequency, the hunt is on to find an improved formula for an era where the
greatest sales growth is being achieved by superstores selling name-brand
electronics at cut-throat prices.;   "We're experimenting from a position of
strength, not weakness," said Radio Shack president Bernard S. Appel. "None of
this experimentation is a result of slowing sales.";   There is no question
that growth eludes Radio Shack.;   The size of the chain, built rapidly in the
'60s and '70s, has been static for years at slightly more than 7,000 stores.
More critically, its sales are shrinking. When the company breaks out Radio
Shack sales for the year ended June 30, they are likely to be slightly less
than $2.9 billion, down about 2 percent from last year and nearly 4 percent
from two years ago.;   But Radio Shack's need to "jump-start its business" is
no different than that of any other consumer electronics retailer, said Dean
Witter analyst Eugene Glazer.;   "Consumer electronics sales have been under
pressure; the consumer really has not been buying," Glazer said. "This is a
universal problem being faced by consumer electronics retailers.";   Out of
the four big publicly traded consumer electronics retailers, only two --
Circuit City Stores Inc. and Good Guys Inc. -- made money last year. The other
two, Best Buy Co. and Highland Superstores Inc., lost money.;   But even
though more than 50 million Americans shop at Radio Shack stores every year,
the retailer still fights an image that it is primarily a source of batteries,
electronic parts and accessories that can't be found elsewhere, analysts
said.;   "The bigger-ticket retail has eluded them," Glazer said.;   "I think
there is a certain customer who would never buy at Radio Shack: He who really
needs snob appeal to justify his purchase," said Liz Buyer, vice president at
Cowen &amp; Co., New York.;   "Radio Shack's brands have never achieved such snob
appeal.;   "I don't know anybody who ever said, 'Gee, I just bought an Optimus
stereo,' " said one Texas analyst.;   Yet Radio Shack's sales may have hit a
plateau because it continues to appeal the same customers it always has. Appel
acknowledges that Radio Shack's market research and experimentation have
focused on existing customers, rather than on electronics buyers who shop
elsewhere.;   Nonetheless, even if it has hit a plateau, Radio Shack is by far
the most profitable seller of consumer electronics. Appel likes to boast that
Radio Shack's profits are greater than all its competitors' combined. And he
may be right.;   Using house brands, such as Realistic, Optimus and Arrow,
means that customers can't easily compare prices with name-brand products,
such as Panasonic or Sony, sold by competitors. Plus Radio Shack often does
its own manufacturing and distribution, allowing the capturing of intermediate
margins along the way. When others make products for Radio Shack, the sheer
volume of its purchases helps drive down negotiated prices.;   As a result,
Radio Shack historically has recorded a gross profit margin, before overhead,
taxes and interest expenses, of more than 50 cents on the dollar for the
products it sells. By contrast, a competitor such as Circuit City is lucky to
record a gross profit of 30 cents on the dollar.;   "It's like a gold mine in
terms of the profits and cash flow it does generate for Tandy," said Van
Zelfden, referring to Radio Shack's parent company.;   But there is pressure
nonetheless to bring name brands into Radio Shack stores. Glazer points out
that if selling name brands produces higher turnover of inventory, Radio Shack
can still produce a greater return on its investment in electronics products.;
  There's plenty of room for improvement there. Radio Shack typically has
turned over its inventory three times a year, where Circuit City inventory
turns over six times a year, Best Buy seven times and Good Guys eight times.; 
 But Radio Shack is only gingerly testing the idea of putting name brands such
as Panasonic in its stores. The first experiment involves putting high-priced
audio products normally found at another retail chain run by Tandy Corp.,
VideoConcepts. The name-brand products will appear only in remote markets and
will not overlap in price with audio products sold under Radio Shack brands,
Appel said.;   Some name-brand products also are likely to show up near the
checkout counters of 750 Radio Shack stores. These will be "impulse" items,
such as wet-dry shavers or leather carrying cases with calculators, that will
be unadvertised, relying solely on foot traffic to spur sales.;   There's even
the possibility of a massive change in the size of Radio Shack stores
themselves. Traditionally, Radio Shack has tried to be the convenience store
of consumer electronics, fitting into 2,400-square-foot pockets at malls and
shopping centers everywhere.;   In the past, that earned the stores
reputations for being cramped and cluttered, particularly when they appealed
largely to electronics buffs who "liked the clutter. They were comfortable
with it," recalls Chris Chilton, a Radio Shack manager before the company
began its recent push to remake its outlets into stylish "technology stores.";
  Now the Tandy Corp. division will try out spacious "super-Shack" stores that
span 5,000 square feet. A three-store test will let Radio Shack stores not
just line their walls with products but set up enclaves that show off how to
automate the control of electronic appliances throughout a home, for instance.  </TEXT>

American Genesis: A Century of Invention and Technological Enthusiasm 1870-1970 
by Thomas P. Hughes (Viking: $24.95; 349 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The central thesis of Thomas P. Hughes' "American Genesis" is simple and 
compelling. The most distinctive, impressive and important achievement in 
American history is not our political system, he says, but our technology. 
</P>
<P>
We are a nation of builders. We have created modern technology and the culture 
that supports it. "Inventors, industrial scientists, engineers, and system 
builders have been the makers of modern America," Hughes writes. "The values of 
order, system, and control that they embedded in machines, devices, processes, 
and systems have become the values of modern technological culture." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes argues that the modern world is the product of a hundred years of 
invention from 1870 to 1970. It was started by a stellar group of independent 
inventors -- Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Lee De Forest and Orville 
and Wilbur Wright, among others -- who inexplicably emerged in the same place 
and at the same moment in history. 
</P>
<P>
In short order, these rugged individuals gave way to scientists at research 
laboratories sponsored by General Electric, AT&amp;T and other industrial 
giants. It was a subtle but important change. Big companies tend to favor 
conformity over originality, improvements in existing products over boldly 
innovative new ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Organizations 
</P>
<P>
The next stage saw the development of system builders, people like Henry Ford 
and Frederick W. Taylor, the creator of scientific management, who organized 
technologies into units of control. Electric power grids resulted, Hughes 
notes, and so, ultimately, did the Manhattan Project, which created the atomic 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"America's creating, building, and systematizing genius reached its zenith in a 
nuclear enterprise, or technological system, that was a culmination of almost a 
century of ever-expanding invention, industrial research, and system building 
that extended from Pearl Street, Edison's first lighting station in New York, 
to . . . Los Alamos." 
</P>
<P>
No one can gainsay the material benefits that the century of invention has 
bestowed on us. But there was a less-obvious Faustian bargain in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The early shift from independent inventor to industrial scientist presaged the 
loss of individuality that order, organization and control would eventually 
impose on everyone. Most of us today are cogs in the great economic machine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japanese Implications 
</P>
<P>
Hughes doesn't say it, but he might have noted that Japan's ability to beat us 
at our own game stems in large measure from the greater willingness of Japanese 
people to be those cogs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, writers like Lewis Mumford and Jacques Ellul began to call 
attention to the downside of progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of seeing and sentimentalizing the United States as essentially a 
nation of democratic politics and free-enterprise economics, the writers and 
philosophers of a counterculture probed the depth and extent of the 
mechanization and systematization of America," Hughes writes. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked what problems arose from the man-made characteristics of built 
America, from -- as Frederick W. Taylor said -- no longer putting man first, 
but putting the system first." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, a historian of science at the University of Pennsylvania, writes with 
sweep and detail. He links diverse phenomena like the military-industrial 
complex and modern art and architecture with his overall vision that order and 
control were the inevitable result of technological progress. His is an epic 
tale told with a rhythm and cadence that match it. 
</P>
<P>
The subtheme of the individual versus the world recurs throughout the story. 
Though it was individuals who kicked off the century of invention, they were 
quickly supplanted by company men, who have remained in the driver's seat ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death of an Inventor 
</P>
<P>
Particularly poignant is Hughes' retelling of the life of Edwin Armstrong, the 
visionary engineer who invented FM radio, only to be fought by RCA and other 
entrenched interests, who did not want their substantial investment in AM radio 
disturbed. After years of legal battles, Armstrong died a suicide in 1954. 
Hughes takes his story as symbolic of the era. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, he does not abandon hope for a change of direction that will 
bring new values to the fore while retaining the benefits that mass technology 
has bestowed. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes recognizes that the current system and the forces behind it have 
tremendous momentum going for them. But, he insists, "Technology can be created 
and can be deployed that would heighten the quality of life, not simply the 
quantity of goods." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But Hughes' haunting book makes a better case for the problem than it 
does for the solution.

<LEADPARA>  AT STANFORD University's computer-music studio, a new breed of

Max V. Mathews belongs to that new breed.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     This crack Bell Laboratories researcher from Murray Hill, N.J., is revered
among computer-composers for having developed digital synthesis, a process
that brought electronic music beyond vacuum tubes, analog circuitry, audio
tape and scissors.;    Mathews came to Stanford in 1987 as he was nearing
retirement age. But anybody who thought his tenure here would be tantamount to
semi-retirement was in for a surprise.;    Mathews, who is about to turn 65,
has been busy building and demonstrating prototypes of his latest invention --
the radio baton -- which promises to turn electronic music into a much more
spontaneous, responsive medium than ever before.;    High-quality sound; 
Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA,
pronounced "karma") has been internationally acclaimed since its beginnings
back in the 1960s.;    Its experiments in computer-generated sound reached
something of a crescendo a decade later with founder-director John Chowning's
development of FM-synthesis, a patented process widely used by Yamaha and
others to produce a high-quality sound from synthesizers.;    Now the studio
is gearing up for its annual outdoor concert, to be presented Thursday evening
at Frost Amphitheater. That program will put computer-music pieces by six
composers in the spotlight.;    An overriding problem with electronic music
has been its tempo limitations. When computer tracks were used to accompany
live instruments, the live musicians had no choice but to follow the beat of
the computer. Instead of the circuitry being slave to the living performer, it
was the other way around.;    Leading performers hate to perform to a computer
tape accompaniment, notes Mathews, "because they have to follow." Needless to
say, that limitation stifled creativity and prompted many musicians to shun
the potentially stimulating electronic collaborations.;    'A very simple
thing';  Mathews is one of several researchers trying to do something about
the problem. Roughly a decade ago, when composer-conductor Pierre Boulez
grappled gloomily with a computer-tape accompaniment that was, in effect, his
master rather than his servant, Mathews decided it was high time for a
change.;    While others have worked on conductors' batons that control the
computer sound, Mathews' has developed a drum-like system that deftly cues the
beats for the computer-stored music, changing its speed or volume at the whim
of its musician-operator. The radio baton is both unique and patented.;   
Mathews is characteristically modest about the invention. "It's a very simple
thing," he says. But a recent demonstration in the CCRMA studios at the Knoll
overlooking the Stanford campus showed something of its potential.;    Soprano
Maureen Chowning, the wife of John Chowning, sang a particularly slow,
delicate Mozart aria, "Deh, vieni," from the opera "Le Nozze di Figaro" to an
accompaniment controlled by the radio baton. The keyboard accompaniment was
stored in the computer, and the playback was cued by Mathews tapping gently
with his drum device. Chowning was able to sustain notes for musical effect,
and Mathews was able to make the accompaniment follow her.;    Mathews has
even more ambitious ideas. He plans to store entire orchestral scores on the
computer and then cue them for use in concertos with the radio baton. "I'd
like to do a whole Beethoven concerto," he says, "with me on the orchestral
part and a soloist live at the piano.";    In fact, once he passes the hurdle
of synthesizing entire orchestral parts, Mathews could bring the whole of the
concerto repertory to the beck and call of soloists developing their
interpretations. Music teachers could use these with advanced violin pupils.
Concerto competitions could harness them, too, in lieu of the piano
accompaniments used today from San Jose to New York City.;    "I try to
control all of the expressive side, while the computer does all the
predetermined parts," notes Mathews.;    For Mathews, however, playing the
musical accompanist is an unaccustomed role. His own musical background
includes neither drum nor keyboard. As he puts it, "I love to play my violin,
but I'm a poor player. I've always looked for instruments that were easier to
play.";    So -- voila! -- the radio baton.;    The holder of a doctorate from
MIT, Mathews is a distinguished and versatile scientist elected to both the
National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. He has
published widely. His radio baton was written up in two different publications
in 1989. The patent was granted last year. He has demonstrated the device in
several countries, most recently France.;    In addition to loudness and
meter, the radio baton can control the amount of vibrato (the vibrancy that
lends luster to a note), whether via voice or violin or synthesizer.;   
Composing in new scales;  Mathews has found an outspoken supporter for the
device in Boston composer Richard Boulanger, who has written several pieces
for it, among them "Holiday Music for the Evening," a setting of a poem by
Hermann Hesse for voice and radio baton.;    Boulanger exploits the
versatility of the computer-music medium by writing in a new scale, which
sounds like the notes from some radically retuned piano. His work bolsters
Mathews' contention that the purpose of computer music isn't to ape existing
music; "it will be to open new doors," says Mathews.;    To demonstrate
Boulanger's work, Maureen Chowning sings it and the computer sounds follow
along in eerie pitches that bygone composers could only have dreamed about,
sending delectable shivers up the spine.;    New doors are opening. And
electronic music clearly has moved far beyond the cliched effects of
horror-movie soundtracks into a realm of greater artistry. Now that the
parameters of expression can be controlled by keen-eared musicians rather than
machines, the sky's the limit.;  Annual outdoor concert of the Center for
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics; Featuring works by Davidovsky,
Kimura, Schottstaedt, Lo, Loy and Oppenheim; Where: Frost Amphitheater,
Stanford University; When: 8:15 p.m. Thursday; Tickets: $7; Call: (415)

   Jackie Sexton had to look no farther than
her father's stomach for inspiration in a contest for practical
inventions.
   The 11-year-old East Greenwich resident won a regional prize for
her design of an expandable dress shirt for ``pudgy pops.''
   When the contest sponsored by the non-profit Invent America was
announced in her sixth-grade class, she immediately thought of a
complaint by her father, Richard, that his dress shirts show too
much stomach when he sat down.
   ``My father complained for years about his shirt,'' she said.
   Jackie split the side seams of one of her father's shirts and
sewed in spandex. The shirt was a success the first time he sat down.
   Her invention, ``Pudgy Pop, the Expandable Dress Shirt for Men,''
won the Rhode Island and regional competitions. The young inventor
won a trip to Washington for herself and her family and a $500
savings bond, as well as a $750 grant for her teacher and a $1,250
grant for her school.

   April Abbott started a dating service that caters

   She's also had plenty of eggheads.
   Ms. Abbott has about 450 clients, and she said 75 percent have
master's degrees or doctorates. Some are superpicky, she said,
approaching romance as if it could be measured and ordered from a
catalogue.
   One man showed Ms. Abbott a chart he had drawn up to find his
dream woman: If the woman was 5 feet tall, she had to be under 100
pounds; if she was 5-1, then she had to be under 104 pounds, and so
on.
   A few academicians have used scientific arguments, hoping to
spark chemistry that wasn't there, she said. One man who was over 55
years old took his blood pressure in front of a young woman to prove
that he wouldn't die of a heart attack during moments of passion.
   And then there's the woman who married the third man she met
through the service, but still wasn't satisified.
   The woman demanded that she be set up with three other men to
``get her money's worth.'' Instead, Ms. Abbott refunded half of her
$125 fee.

   Politicians often seek a captive
audience, and Gov. Ned McWherter has found one: around town in
restrooms, where his face smiles from a radio station's advertising
posters.
   The advertisement shows the governor wearing a cap bearing the
name of Bubba Skynyrd, a ``redneck'' character who is the alter ego
of disc jockey Carl P. Mayfield on WKDF-FM's morning rock 'n' roll
radio show. McWherter's right hand is raised.
   ``Haaay Dudes! I took the oath ... to listen mornings,'' the ad
says.
   Nashville's Graffiti Indoor Advertising placed the ads last month
in about 36 Nashville locations, mostly in restaurant bathrooms,
said account executive Lars Frederiksen.
   ``I was at a press conference, one of Carl P.'s boys passed me a
cap and I put it on and posed, and that's how I got involved,''
McWherter told WKRN-TV before leaving for Europe this week to
recruit industry.
   McWherter spokesman Ken Renner said the governor generally
prefers not to have his office or likeness used for advertising.
   ``There's not much we can do about it,'' Renner said.

   From the days when inventor Thomas
Edison's light bulb first lit the nights of 1879, Americans have
been regarded as naturally inventive and creative.
   Much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists and
engineers at General Electric's Research and Development Center,
which traces its roots to the Edison Electrical Light Company formed
in 1878 to support the experiments of Thomas Edison.
   GE scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager, which
uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internal
organs without X-rays.
   Real diamonds were concocted in one of their laboratories, not
pulled from the depths of the earth.
   In 1979, GE was the first company to pass the 50,000th patent
mark.
   But GE's _ and America's _ technological lead is being threatened
by the Japanese who, up until now, have had a reputation as clever
copycats.
   Since the end of World War II, the Japanese have borrowed
American inventions, improved them and turned them into inexpensive
household staples. Color television sets, transistor radios and
videocassettee recorders were all original American ideas the
Japanese have capitalized on.
   All that is changing.
   The Japanese are no longer content to pick the brains of American
scientists and engineers for new technology, says Roland W. Schmitt,
president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy and former
vice president of corporate research and development at GE.
   The Japanese are trying to be innovators, Schmitt says.
   Their aggressive patenting efforts prove that. Japan now acquires
more patents worldwide than any other country.
   Schmitt says the United States still leads the way in developing
new technology. ``But Japan is now in a stage where they're starting
to do this,'' he said.
   Japanese business executives say it's only natural for their
companies to develop their own technology.
   ``Any company that hopes to continue making progress will require
innovation, be it through its own or transferred technology,'' said
Kazuya Hosaka, manager of Hitachi Ltd.'s patent office in Tokyo.
   Many in this country question whether the Japanese can be
pioneering.
   The Japanese acquire hundreds of patents each year, they're quick
at turning inventions into products and their students study science
and technology in an education system considered superior in those
areas.
   But they're strangled by a culture that frowns upon risk-taking
and prizes collective action over individual effort. Their
scientists and engineers aren't trained to be pioneering.
   Americans, meanwhile, are encouraged to be creative.
   ``We educate our scientists to be pioneers,'' Schmitt said.
   A recent study for the National Science Foundation showed that in
1987, three Japanese companies garnered the most U.S. patents:
Hitachi with 873, Canon with 850 and Toshiba with 830.
   GE, which until 1986 had held the No. 1 spot for 25 years, was
fourth with 782 patents.
   GE executives at the company's R&amp;D center, located in a sprawling
complex of buildings overlooking the Mohawk River, dispute the
results of the patent study done by Computer Horizons, a consulting
company. They argue GE would still rank as patent leader if the
study had included patents granted to RCA, which GE acquired in 1986.
   ``Whoever did the study obviously didn't know RCA was a
subsidiary of GE,'' said James C. Davis Jr., manager of patent and
legal operations at GE.
   Top GE officials, though, see the study as a warning.
   ``It doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned,'' said Walter Robb,
vice president of corporate research and development at GE. ``There
are still three Japanese companies in the top four.''
   Moreover, the Japanese are beating the United States is their
ability to rapidly commercialize inventions, such as the VCR.
   ``We get out of the starting block fast,'' Schmitt said. ``But we
lose it on the long stretch. We've lost the ability to do the long
haul.''
   America's best hope in its competition with Japan may be its
education system. The United States is far ahead of Japan in an area
vital to technological and scientific development: the encouragement
of creative thought.
   Yet serious problems exist in America's education system.
   ``We have fewer and fewer students with an interest in science
and technology,'' said Schmitt, a former chairman of the National
Science Board.
   He believes that for the United States to remain No. 1 in science
and technology it must, in some ways, imitate the Japanese.
   ``The Japanese understand that manufacturability and customer
preferences are integral parts of the innovation process, not
afterthoughts,'' Schmitt said. ``I see no reason why we Americans
can't renew our skills at the application of science and technology
while maintaining our strength as pioneers.''

<HEAD>Longtime Hughes Executive Hyland Dead at 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawrence A. ``Pat'' Hyland, the former
head of Hughes Aircraft Co. whose inventions helped pioneer radar
technology and aircraft communications, died Friday. He was 92.
   Hyland died at Antelope Valley Hospital, where he had been
admitted Tuesday following a heart attack, Hughes spokesman Bill
Herrman said.
   Hyland served as vice president and chief executive officer at
Hughes from 1954 to 1976. He was named the aerospace firm's
president and chairman of the board after founder Howard Hughes
died in 1976.
   Throughout, however, Hyland ran the company. He retired in 1984,
assuming the title of chairman emeritus, and continued to work out
of his office several times a week.
   Under Hyland's tenure, Hughes grew from a modest producer of
airborne fire control systems to the nation's largest defense
electronics company and a leading builder of communications
satellites.
   Hyland held an early patent that contributed to the development
of radio detection and imaging, or radar, which bounces radio
signals off distant objects to determine their location.
   Hyland was born in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia on Aug.
26, 1897, and came with his family to the United States at the age
of 2.
   He served as a sergeant in the U.S. Army Field Artillery during
World War I, receiving five battle stars for his service with the
Second Division in France He joined the U.S. Navy, where he worked
as a chief radioman between 1920 and 1926 and helped demonstrate a
blind landing system for aircraft.
   In 1926 he joined the Naval Research Laboratory as a radio
engineer and, in 1932, demonstrated the reflection of radio waves
from aircraft.
   Hyland held other patents that enabled aircraft to communicate
with each other and with the ground via radio and to determine
their altitude during blind landings. Many of his developments were
adopted in standard aircraft electronics systems.
   Hyland founded Radio Research Co. in Washington, D.C. in 1932,
heading the firm until it merged into Bendix Corp. five years
later. During a 17-year tenure with Bendix he became vice president
in charge of engineering before leaving to join Hughes.
   Hyland is survived by his wife, Muriel, and a daughter.

   Fifty years after commercial television made
its flickering debut at the New York World's Fair, the passion of a
gangly teen-ager who made it possible is finally being requited.
   ``It's high time,'' said Elma ``Pem'' Farnsworth, who for 44
years was sounding board, sweetheart, lab assistant and wife to
Philo Taylor Farnsworth.
   But she wasn't his first love. Television was.
   Farnsworth, who died in 1971, was 15 years old in 1922 when he
diagrammed his idea for an electronic TV system on a high school
blackboard in this eastern Idaho farming town.
   Chemistry teacher Justin Tolman's memory of that drawing,
including the first description of an electronic ``image
dissector'' TV camera tube, helped Farnsworth win the first in a
series of patent battles with RCA over early TV technology in the
1930s.
   But if Farnsworth won the battles, RCA won the war. Outside
Idaho and his native Utah, most history and reference books place
him on the sidelines among ``other pioneers'' who contributed to
television's development.
   Most of the glory went to Vladimir Zworykin, the
Russian-American inventor who developed the iconoscope and
kinescope during a career primarily with RCA. Farnsworth, who
received some 160 patents, finally was inducted into the National
Inventors Hall of Fame in 1984 _ seven years after Zworykin.
   ``We're going to set the record straight across the country,''
said Kent Farnsworth, the inventor's son.
   Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter proclaimed May 2 ``Philo T. Farnsworth
Day,'' kicking off a fund-raising effort for a bronze statue of
Farnsworth in National Statuary Hall. It is scheduled for placement
May 2, 1990 in the U.S. Capitol.
   Farnsworth, who was born in the southwestern Utah town of
Beaver, was picked for the honor by the Utah Legislature at the
urging of a Salt Lake City elementary school class that researched
a number of famous Utahns.
   ``People kind of like a guy who's an underdog,'' said Bruce
Barnson, principal at Ridgecrest Elementary. ``Here's a guy who was
brilliant, came up with television and really got nothing out of
it.''
   In Rigby, the Farnsworth Television Group is raising money for a
TV museum to highlight his achievements. There already are signs on
U.S. 20 leading into the town of 2,600 proclaiming Rigby the
``Birthplace of Television.''
   The Community Center, in a former bank building, has a
collection of Farnsworth memorabilia in what used to be a vault.
Last year it featured the Emmy he won posthumously in 1978 for his
contributions to TV technology.
   Mrs. Farnsworth, now 81, recently wrote an essay about her
husband for People magazine, criticizing RCA chief David Sarnoff's
effort to ``control the television industry just like he'd
controlled radio.''
   That theme is explored further in a book Mrs. Farnsworth hopes
to publish titled, ``Distant Vision: Romance and Discovery on an
Invisible Frontier.''
   She recounts how the financial strain of legal disputes with RCA
forced the Farnsworth Television &amp; Radio Corp. to the verge of
bankruptcy, and finally to sell out to International Telephone &amp;
Telegraph in 1949.
   But Edward W. Herold, a former RCA researcher and retired
director of the electronics research laboratory at the David
Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, N.J., said jabs at Sarnoff,
Zworykin or RCA are misplaced.
   ``I think Farnsworth got plenty of credit from the historians,
more than he deserves. He was really a genius; a really bright
guy,'' Herold said.
   ``Farnsworth was a competitor, and a good competitor... But I
would say he was eventually overwhelmed by the number of brilliant
people we had at RCA.''
   Farnsworth, who continued research in physics after selling the
business, developed an early electron microscope to study the
uniformity of the phosphor coating on tubes in the image dissector.
His work also helped in development of night-vision scopes, radar
and an incubator for premature babies.
   He was at Brigham Young University at the time of his death,
working on an area of physics that science has yet to conquer _
nuclear fusion.
   Mrs. Farnsworth said new attention to his life should be an
example to a new generation of discoverers. ``Phil was told
television was impossible by everyone he talked to about it. I'm
hoping this will encourage young people to stick by their guns and
not be dissuaded by anyone.''

<F P=106> [Report by Marianela Samper; from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The first international seminar on industrial 
property and business possibilities in Cuba has concluded in 
Havana with a positive discussion of experiences by experts and 
specialists from the 14 nations that gathered here. The debate 
was enhanced by topics as important as Latin American 
integration in industrial property [propiedad industrial] and 
what the subcontinent could do in light of the new challenges 
posed by the revamping of the international legal order, which 
is gaining strength. 
  Regarding the use of the patents cooperation agreement, 
which 
began (?in May) 1978 under the auspices of the Intellectual 
Property World Organization [Organizacion Mundial de Propiedad 
Intellectual], the participants discussed some of the advantages 
to the countries that adhere to it, including the right to 
defend claims on inventions in more than 60 countries and the 
extension of the time granted to applicants before entering the 
national phase; these advantages allow for further development 
of the invention, marketing, and facilitate a better financial 
condition in order to meet other expenditures. Here, one needs 
access to an extensive technological bibliography. Jesus 
Sanchez Lima, from the United States, has commented on the 
treaty and the North to South transfer of technology. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] I look at it from a perspective 
different from other participants in this field, many who 
primarily.... [pauses] regarding the lobbying by the (?First 
World) against the Third World. Though I believe in the patents 
system and think these limited monopolies granted to the 
inventors are the most effective way to stimulate inventions, I 
believe, nonetheless, there must be a limit to those monopolies. 
Those limits in many countries that are forced by economic 
reasons to join treaties like GATT and NAFTA may not yield the 
expected results. [end recording] 
  During the international seminar emphasis was also placed on 
the overlap between copyright or industrial property, which 
provide protection to artistic and literary works, and 
inventions and patent rights. There was a consensus to consider 
a possible legal system, at both the national and international 
levels and to establish the principle of a single right over 
goods and materials. In conclusion, here is the opinion of one 
of the Cuban experts who attended the meeting. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] It has challenged us 
to exercise our intelligence, and by that word I mean the 
intelligence of those who live in Cuba. It has made us think 
beyond what we are used to thinking and even open ourselves to 
the challenges our domestic policy of promoting foreign 
investments in certain sectors are posing. Matters we had not 
considered, including in our legislation, are discussed here as 
the problems other legislations have. They will not be problems 
for our laws, because we have been forewarned. In a general 
sense, the [word indistinct] is highly positive. [end recording] 
  This seminar also served to explore the future report that 
will contain the steps Cuba has been taking against legal 
regulations on industrial property and the expectations it 
offers Latin America by adjusting its laws.

JAMES FLANIGAN: MATSUSHITA'S VISION GOES BEYOND HORIZON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why is Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan, one of the world's largest 
consumer electronics firms, interested in acquiring MCA Inc., the giant U.S. 
entertainment company? 
</P>
<P>
In the short term, the answer is easy. Matsushita, with $44 billion in annual 
sales, wants films and TV shows it can sell along with televisions and VCRs in 
all parts of the globe and songs to go with its stereo and compact disc 
players. 
</P>
<P>
And if it pays up to $7.5 billion for MCA, Matsushita will get films and songs 
in abundance. MCA, with $3.5 billion in sales, owns Universal Studios ("Back to 
the Future," "Field of Dreams," "Jaws," "E.T." and many more), plus an enormous 
library of television programs that includes "Murder She Wrote" and "Miami 
Vice," plus one of the largest record companies in the world, plus the 
Universal Studios Tour theme parks. In a single purchase, Matsushita would buy 
a worldwide distribution system for films and records, an incomparable value. 
</P>
<P>
But Matsushita's reasons go beyond the short term. It is looking at the 
development of home entertainment technology -- at high-definition television 
and, later, more complex, computer-like instruments. There's vision in 
Matsushita's moves. 
</P>
<P>
The deal isn't signed yet, and merger talks involving MCA have fallen through 
in the past. Still, something is afoot. So we should understand what the deeper 
implications are. 
</P>
<P>
In the next few days you may hear a lot of noise about Japan buying up U.S. 
movie studios. But chances are the noise will miss the underlying issue, which 
is vision in Japanese business and lack of vision in American business. 
</P>
<P>
So why does Matsushita want to own MCA's films and shows? That's essentially 
the same question that was asked a year ago when Sony bought Columbia Pictures. 
And the answer is that humble products change and develop -- the phonograph 
becomes the stereo and then becomes the compact disc player. The mundane TV set 
is becoming high-definition television and nowhere more prominently than at 
Matsushita, which employs HDTV's inventor, Takashi Fujio. 
</P>
<P>
Owning the programing is important because it gives you something to show on 
the advanced TV set and also persuades producers to film for your new 
technology. "If you get the technology going, producers will begin shooting 
HDTV because they think of the rerun market, of the future value of their 
product," says a senior television executive. 
</P>
<P>
The vision used to be American. When Radio Corp. of America originated radio, 
it also created the National Broadcasting Co. to have something to broadcast; 
when the same RCA developed color television, it pushed programmers to film in 
color. But, sadly, RCA lost its vision, declined and ultimately sold out to 
General Electric, which unloaded its TV-making business. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita's vision looks beyond tomorrow's marketplace to what its annual 
report calls "emerging new products in audio-visual technology, including 
liquid crystal and digital TV. "Our long-range plans encompass 
computer-controlled audio visual and home automation systems. We will 
revitalize the home electronics market." 
</P>
<P>
What do reruns of "Jaws" have to do with computers? Plenty, says Paul Saffo, 
research fellow of the Institute for the Future, a Menlo Park, Calif., research 
firm. "Entertainment programing is better at getting computer-like machines 
into the home than more technical software," says Saffo. "Just look at Nintendo 
and its game systems." 
</P>
<P>
With MCA, of course, Matsushita would buy great libraries of entertainment 
software. But the MCA deal would be only one part of the mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Matsushita made another, much smaller deal. It agreed to 
invest in Owl International, a Bellevue, Wash., software company that makes a 
"hypermedia engine." That's an electronic equivalent of a library card 
catalogue, allowing you to pick programing through your TV set-computer. So you 
might come home some future night, flick on a screen in your wall and choose to 
view the Battle of Hastings or the life of a Chinese empress. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, it's a long leap from Matsushita's negotiation with MCA to the coming 
of walk-in television. But nobody doubts that information technology will 
develop massively in this decade, that computers and communications will come 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Matsushita understands that. In an interview in Osaka two years ago, 
Masayuki Nakajima, director of engineering at Matsushita's Central Research 
Laboratory, summed up the company's business. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest inventions of the 20th Century are the semiconductor and the 
laser," he said. "The semiconductor has brought progress in the field of 
computers and the laser has contributed directly to communications. We are 
devoted to progress in both." 
</P>
<P>
Now, lots of U.S. companies think like Matsushita; the U.S. electronics and 
computer industry sees the trend of technology. But are U.S. companies acting 
on their vision as Matsushita is? If the TV set and the TV show make a good 
combination in consumer electronics, why does NBC no longer have the TV sets? 
Why is MCA for sale and not Matsushita?

<HEAD>Co-Inventor of Transistor William Shockley Dies At Stanford</HEAD>

   By helping to invent the transistor,
William Shockley did as much to shape the modern world as Louis
Pasteur or Madame Curie, colleagues said. But he died with a
reputation tarnished by his controversial racial theories.
   Shockley, who shared the 1956 Nobel Prize for physics, died
Saturday of prostate cancer at his home on the campus of Stanford
University, the university said Sunday. He was 79.
   He was among the fathers of the electronic age but spent his
later years embroiled in controversy over his theory that
intelligence is genetically based, and that blacks as a group are
inferior to whites.
   ``I would say he would have to be compared to people who opened
up huge new areas, such as Pasteur or the Salk vaccine,'' said
Professor William E. Spicer, Shockley's friend and colleague for 33
years.
   ``But certainly the controversies he got into later in life made
it much more difficult for him to get recognition for his key
contribution,'' said Spicer, a professor of electrical engineering
at Stanford.
   Shockley shared the Nobel Prize with his colleagues from Bell
Laboratories, John Bardeen and the late Walter H. Brattain. He also
was professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford.
   The team's first device, developed during what they later called
a ``magic month'' during 1947, was an innovation that made vacuum
tubes obsolete and the electronic age possible. Most modern
devices, from airplanes to wristwatches to computers, contain the
technical descendants of Shockley's work.
   Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories, the company he founded
after leaving Bell labs in 1954, was instrumental in the birth of
Silicon Valley and the electronics industry. His former employees
later invented the integrated circuit and the microprocessor, the
building blocks of the computer age.
   ``It's a great loss for Stanford,'' said Joseph W. Goodman,
chairman of the school's electrical engineering department.
   Shockley ``has made the most important revolution in the 20th
century,'' Makoto Kikuchi, the executive technical adviser of Sony
Corp. who has known Shockely since 1960, said in an interview. ``He
had not imagined his invention would lead to such a rapid
revolution in electronics.,''
   Shockley's sparked campus demonstrations by claiming that
intellectually inferior blacks were producing children faster than
mentally superior whites. His genetic theories also prompted debate
over the use of IQ tests in schools and over why blacks failed to
score as well as whites. Most experts have blamed this outcome on
biased tests and other factors not related to genetics.
   Many of Shockley's scientific colleagues ridiculed his racial
theories and abandoned their association with him, claiming he had
passed beyond his field of expertise and was acting irresponsibly.
   In his later years, Shockley tried several times to befriend
blacks he came into contact with, Spicer said. ``I think he very
much would have liked to have found a black person who would be a
personal friend,'' he said.
   A 1980 article in The Atlanta Constitution comparing Shockley's
theories to Nazism drew a libel suit from Shockley, who sued the
newspaper for $1.25 million. A federal jury awarded him $1 in the
case, and the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986 turned down Shockley's
attempt to revive the lawsuit.
   Shockley's wife, Emmy, said he considered his research on
intelligence his most valuable work and that he continued to write
papers on the subject until a few days before his death.
   At the age of 68, he contributed his sperm to a sperm bank in
Southern California that founders said was designed to help pass on
the genetic makeup of ``geniuses.''
   Shockley, whose father was a mining engineer and whose
grandfather was a whaling captain, was born in London and grew up
in Palo Alto, near the campus where he died.
   He was one of the children tested in Louis Terman's classic
study of gifted children but failed to test high enough to advance
to the follow-up study. He was fond of pointing out that Terman
passed over two later Nobel Prize winners.
   Shockley received his Ph.D. in the then-esoteric field of
solid-state physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in 1932 and joined the staff of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co.'s Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., in 1936.
   After a year of working on vacuum tubes as replacements for
mechanical switches in telephone exchanges, Shockley resumed his
research on how electrons behaved with crystals. He met Brattain
through that work.
   World War II put a stop to the research. Shockley went to work
for the government, and did not return to Bell Labs until 1945,
about the time that Bardeen joined.
   With Shockley and Bardeen as theoreticians and Brattain as the
experimenter, the team resumed efforts to create a solid-state
device that would amplify electronic signals like the more
vulnerable, bulkier and power-hungry vacuum tubes of the day.
Research teams at MIT, General Electric, Purdue University and the
University of Pennsylvania also were in the race.
   On Dec. 23, 1947, the Bell Labs team conducted the first
successful demonstration of a crude transistor: a pair of metal
cat's whiskers, 2,000th of an inch apart, stuck into a slab of
germanium.
   Shockley is survived by his wife; three children from a previous
marriage, two sons, William and Richard, and a daughter Alison
Ianelli; and one granddaughter.

PAT HYLAND; EX-HUGHES AIRCRAFT HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aerospace industry executive Lawrence A. (Pat) Hyland, who headed Hughes 
Aircraft Co. for nearly a quarter of a century, died Friday of a heart attack 
at Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland, 92, retired from the Los Angeles-based company in 1984, but he had 
remained active in the firm's affairs, serving as chairman emeritus and coming 
to his office at headquarters several times a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat Hyland was one of the giants of our industry," said Malcolm R. Currie, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Hughes. "His vision and leadership were 
an inspiration to us all, and he will be sorely missed." 
</P>
<P>
Known as a vigorous, practical man with what one friend called "immense common 
sense," Hyland is credited with leading Hughes to a pre-eminent position as a 
supplier of defense electronics and communications satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Although he lacked formal college training, Hyland nevertheless was an 
inventor, holding early patents in aircraft communications, direction finding 
and radar. As a radio engineer at the Naval Research Laboratory in 1932, he 
demonstrated the reflection of radio waves from aircraft -- credited as a basic 
discovery in the development of modern radar. 
</P>
<P>
For his work, he was awarded the U.S. Navy Distinguished Public Service Medal 
in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Nova Scotia, he came to the United States at age 2, graduated from high 
school in Melrose, Mass., in 1915, served in the Army during World War I, and 
became a naturalized citizen in 1919. He was a chief radioman in the U.S. Navy 
from 1920 to 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland formed Radio Research Co. of Washington and headed the firm for five 
years before the company merged with Bendix Corp. in 1937. He worked for Bendix 
for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland joined Hughes as vice president and general manager in 1954, serving for 
24 years in those posts before becoming president of the company after the 
death of Howard Hughes in April, 1976. 
</P>
<P>
In his years at Hughes, Hyland was active in helping guide defense policy, 
serving on the advisory committee of the Argonne National Nuclear Laboratory, 
for example. He was also chairman of the Central Intelligence Agency's 
strategic advisory committee for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland, who received an honorary doctorate in engineering in 1954 from Lawrence 
Institute of Technology in Southfield, Mich., also served as a trustee of 
Harvey Mudd College and the California Museum of Science and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his interest in quarter horse racing, Hyland served as a director or 
officer of several quarter horse associations. In 1981, the Pacific Coast 
Quarter Horse Racing Assn. honored him as horseman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland is survived by his widow, Muriel, and a daughter, Ginger. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service was tentatively scheduled for Tuesday at Westwood Methodist 
Church in Los Angeles.

   Emerson Radio Corp., of North Bergen, N.J., blamed
"extremely disappointing sales" for a fiscal first-quarter
loss of $4.8 million, or 13 cents a share.
   In the year-earlier quarter, net income was $3.5 million,
or 10 cents a share. The maker and marketer of consumer
electronics reported sales for the quarter ended June 30 of
$167.8 million, down 24% from $221.2 million a year earlier.
Stephen L. Lane, president, said in a statement that he
expects the next two quarters to be profitable, "assuming
moderate improvement in the retail environment."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Lane said that because of "softness in the retail
marketplace, retailers have remained cautious in acquiring
inventory." He said Emerson has in turn become conservative,
reducing its own inventories from the prior quarter and
taking cost-paring steps.
   During the past year, Emerson introduced a line of
personal computers and related products for the home office
and consumer markets.

<HEADLINE>  BILL KENNEDY, PARTICLE PHYSICIST
HE HELPED DEVELOP STANFORD ACCELERATOR  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Obituaries  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     He and Mr. Kennedy were part of a team of Stanford University researchers
who built the first linear electron accelerator more than 40 years ago.;  
That accelerator led to the development of X-ray equipment that today
irradiates cancerous tumors.;   It wasn't the only incongruous twist in the 76
years of William Robert Kennedy.;   As a Montana State College graduate
studying at the Illinois Institute of Technology, he had proposed to write a
thesis on "A Linear Electron Accelerator." School officials had planned to
allow Mr. Kennedy to try to put his theory into practice, said his daughter,
Kathleen Anderson, only to back down when a French physicist said it couldn't
be done.;   Later, as World War II approached and with his master's degree in
physics from Illinois Tech, he returned to his native Montana to teach Army
Air Corpsmen, hoping he could learn to fly for his country, too.;   Heeded
science's call;   His scientific skills were needed elsewhere, he was told, so
he headed to New York to work on radar development at Sperry Gyroscope.;   But
he refused to quit pursuing his pilot's license even after he crashed a plane
on Long Island. Years later he would become an aerobatic flier.;   Still, the
accelerator kept calling, and at Sperry, Mr. Kennedy linked up with William W.
Hansen, a Stanford physics professor who a decade earlier had invented a
microwave resonator he called the "rhumbatron" to generate radio waves at very
high frequencies. It eventually was used to develop the linear accelerator.;  
By 1946, Mr. Kennedy had come West with Hansen to Stanford to complete his
doctorate and to try to smash atoms. Hansen also enlisted Carlson, who was
working on his master's degree, and Stanley Kaisel, an electrical engineering
graduate student.;   Started in physics building;   They set up shop in the
basement of a physics building on campus. "Hansen was the brains," said
Kaisel, who later obtained his doctorate, helped set up the electronics
research laboratory at Stanford and today is a management consultant in
Portola Valley.;   Mr. Kennedy kept at his dissertation on "A Linear Electron
Accelerator" and Carlson began building the 3-foot-long, 3 1/2-inch-thick tube
that would become a first.;   The hull had to be machined to a high tolerance,
said Kaisel, and Hansen had grown up with precision tools. "He was an eclectic
kind of guy, as good in making things with his own hands as he was in the
theoretical.";   But he also was a "knob-twister," said Carlson, and the three
tried to keep him from fiddling.;   Although a proton accelerator with
positive charge was developed at the University of California, the Hansen
team's negatively charged electron accelerator won the race with competitors
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.;   "Hansen was our leader," said
Carlson, who went to work for Hughes after getting his degree and rose to the
presidency of one of its 15,000-employee divisions, "but Bill Kennedy was
really a first-rate guy with a tremendous brain.";   Edward Ginzton, who took
over the accelerator development after the death of the 39-year-old Hansen and
became one of the co-founders at Varian Associates, acknowledged Mr. Kennedy's
"successful demonstration of the principle of the accelerator" in his doctoral
thesis.;   Radiation therapy equipment is a byproduct of the accelerator, but
a direct line from the accelerator to a product is another matter. "The honest
answer to the question about the practical application of basic research is I
don't know," said Bill Kirk, assistant SLAC director, "but 100 years ago when
the same question was asked, that research led to the electromagnets and radio
and television.";   After he obtained his doctorate from Stanford in 1948, Mr.
Kennedy headed for UCLA and work on an atomic energy project, his daughter
said.;   Eventually he established his own company, Kennedy Industries, in
Banning, and for more than two decades produced a connector for printed
circuit boards in early computers.;   Mr. Kennedy closed his company in 1973
and moved to Idaho, where he resumed his passion for flying. A heart attack in
1973 slowed him down, his daughter said, but he refurbished a clipped-wing
Taylorcraft and did aerobatics in it whenever he could.; (box)Born: July 12,

   Chairman Akio Morita of Sony Corp. grew up in a
wealthy family surrounded by the best technology of the 1920s and
1930s: A Victor phonograph, a Westinghouse refrigerator and a Buick
sedan.
   He went to American movies. ``King Kong'' was a favorite.
   Today, his company not only sets a high standard for consumer
electronics around the world, it owns America's largest record
company and is buying a major Hollywood motion picture studio.
   Sony's plan to pay $3.4 billion to take over Columbia Pictures,
following its buyout of CBS Records in 1987, has some Americans
worried a Japanese company is taking over the popular cultural
heart of the country.
   But the friendly takeover is only the latest in decades of
international investment by a company that has proved its
sophistication in operating around the world.
   Morita helped found a tiny company in the basement of a
bombed-out department store in 1946 and its early attempts at an
electric rice cooker failed.
   Morita himself, trained as a physicist, struggled to paste
together paper hand-painted with magnetic material to use as tape
in Japan's first tape recorder. Postwar shortages made plastic
unavailable.
   But when in the 1950s Sony bought the rights to an American
invention called the transistor and used it in ways its originators
never imagined _ in radios _ the Sony reputation for innovation was
born.
   In the 1960s Sony transformed video tape recorders, also an
American invention, from huge machines run with vacuum tubes to
compact transistorized models that became the professional standard.
   When it adapted those machines for home use in the 1970s, it
helped create the VCR and the culture of ``couch potatoes,'' people
who don't have to leave the house for entertainment.
   In the 1980s Sony's Walkman became a symbol of self-absorbed
joggers, commuters and other yuppies. Today its superlight
camcorders help parents capture their children's first steps on
video and tiny Watchman VCRs let them watch movies on the run.
   Now, with its foray into music and movies, Sony may be putting
its stamp on America of the 1990s as well. But Sony says it wants
to keep the American style of the software it's buying.
   ``Globally, U.S. (entertainment) software is the most
influential,'' Morita said at a recent news conference. ``Columbia
Pictures and CBS Records will remain in the hands of American
management.''
   ``Our motto is global localization,'' he said, and industry
analysts say it's more than an empty slogan.
   Almost half of Sony's 78,900 employees are local people in its
27 overseas factories in places ranging from San Diego to Singapore
to Bridgend, England.
   Sixty-six percent of its sales are outside Japan, and so is much
of its production. Sony began manufacturing in the United States in
the 1970s, long before the recent wave of Japanese investment there.
   Almost all of the televisions Sony sells in the United States
are made locally and 20 percent of its San Diego production is for
export.
   Sony's Bridgend plant exports components all over Europe, and in
1987 won a British government award for exports.
   Industry analysts say Sony's style as well as its structure is
far more international than most Japanese companies. Considered an
upstart by old-line Japanese firms, Sony has an anti-hierarchical
and risk-taking style that sets it apart.
   Morita sets the tone. One of the few true founding entrepreneurs
still heading a major company in a country where most presidents
are merely employees, Morita hawked transistor radios to retailers
in New York and had to fight the image of poor-quality that ``made
in Japan'' meant at the time.
   He has a thick shock of white hair and speaks English with a
fluency few senior Japanese businessmen can boast. Morita, 68, is
blunt by Japanese standards, or even by American ones.
   His recent book, ``The Japan That Can Say `No,''' co-authored
with conservative politician Shintaro Ishihara, caused a stir in
Washington for the way it pulls no punches in the U.S.-Japan
economic debate. Morita has long warned that the United States must
revitalize its electronics industry by investing more in research
and development.
   Morita this year handed over daily management of Sony to its
president, Norio Ohga, an opera singer by training who was hired
because of his frank criticism of Sony's tape recorders when he was
a student in the 1950s.
   Ohga is expected to lead the company beyond its roots in
consumer electronics and into a diversified range of products from
software to industrial electronics.
   The company's sales jumped 38 percent to $16.3 billion in the
year ended March 31, and profits nearly doubled to $549 million.
After several hard years when its Betamax video system gradually
lost out to the VHS standard made by other companies, Sony is back
in full force, analysts say.
   Last year Sony spent more than $1 billion on research and
development, or about 7 percent of sales.

   TALK RADIO finds a deeper voice in the wake of the Persian
Gulf war.
   Americans tune in for "talk therapy" in a move that could
help firm up ad rates and the image of ailing AM radio's big
breadwinner. "That's what it's all about -- delivering ears,"
says Bruce Bishop Cheen of Paul Kagan Associates. But will
those ears stay tuned? If so, networks may re-think radio
programming, he says. Veteran talk-show host Barry Farber
thinks his audience rose 80% in the first days of war, but
gains have since slowed. "Even if we keep 5% we will have
done a magnificent thing," he says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CBS Radio Networks tried the talk format for only the
second time ever last Friday and estimates 87% of its 600
affiliates took its live, two-hour show. Would CBS do it
again? "I think so," says Larry Cooper, head of network radio
news. Michael Harrison, editor of "Talkers" newspaper, says
station call volume initially rose some 300% but has cooled
as even hosts tire of the topic. But they netted some vital
first-timers. And while the war has eaten into television ad
time, radio talk shows always have room for commercials, Mr.
Harrison notes.
   Ad gap: A 30-second network TV spot costs about $100,000;
a similar radio spot about $1,500, says Mr. Cheen.
                                                                                                       

   FIX YOUR FACE, cosmetic firms urge, with an armload of
"repair" products.
   Aimed at the over-30 set -- in terms of age and income --
items like Estee Lauder's Advanced Night Repair ($40 for 0.87
ounce) and Revlon's Lash Repair (about $3.75 for 0.25 ounce)
jostle for shelf space. Most highlight skin care, a segment
that's likely to inch ahead of the industry with a growth
rate of 8% to 10% a year, says Deepak Raj, a Merrill Lynch
analyst. Not even the recession should blemish sector sales,
says consultant Allan Mottus. "People want to look well
groomed. It is usually one of the last things to go."
   Why "repair"? People like a "therapeutic approach" that
suggests something can be done about aging, says Diana
Temple, a Salomon Brothers analyst. For instance, Elizabeth
Arden says its Ceramide Time Complex Capsules help "repair
the natural barrier function of the skin." Such claims bother
Kim Gandy of the National Organization of Women. "Now, it's
not just `use this if you want to look beautiful.' It's `use
this or you'll stay broken,'" she says.
                                                                                                       

   LIGHTS] CAMERA] AUCTION? Movies snap up books, often
before publishers bid.
   Hollywood scouts new works, muddling the traditional
publishers' auction format with more competition and big
fees. Signed first for films: "The Firm," "Mama's Boy" and
"Private Lies." Doubleday Editor in Chief David Gernert
notes, "I hear as much about what's going on in publishing
and what books are hot by talking to movie people." He says
Doubleday and Dell snapped up "The Firm" for hard-cover and
soft-cover book rights just after the film deal -- for about
one-third of the movie rights.
   The economics of the two industries are coasts apart, says
Howard Kaminsky, head of Hearst Book Group, whose Morrow unit
is publishing "Lies." Sony's Tri-Star Pictures reportedly
bought film rights to "Lies" for over $1 million -- a steep
price for a book-to-be. Mr. Kaminsky says he paid
"considerably less." He adds the studio provides valuable
promotion. A possible triple play for publishers: hardback to
paperback to reissued paperback -- if the film succeeds.
   The three top-selling paperbacks are tied to films:
"Dances With Wolves," "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "Misery."
                                                                                                       

   FAILURE GROUP INC., a Menlo Park, Calif., firm that
examines business catastrophes like engineering or scientific
mishaps, succeeds in getting upgraded to a "buy" from a
"hold" by Prudential-Bache analyst Laura Conigliaro in the
face of recession and war.
                                                                                                       

   SUPERBOWL STATS of the marketing sort from image
consultants Landor Associates in San Francisco: The game
scores highest among 18-to-29-year-olds whose annual incomes
range from $25,000 to $50,000.
                                                                                                       

   SPENDING 101: Stanford University MBA students in a
philanthropy course decide how to allocate $10,000 to
charity. Funds come from the Peninsula Community Foundation,
San Mateo, Calif. Proposals come from other students.
                                                                                                       

   PURCHASING AGENTS eye lean inventory in an increasingly
ailing economy.
   Corporate buyers who stock everything from paperclips to
polypropylene are keeping inventories tight, says Robert
Bretz, head of the National Association of Purchasing
Management's survey group. He feels buyers' recession
strategies may now cut deeper if the war curbs consumer
spending and slices demand for their products.
   For many, supplies remain abundant. "I don't see any
shortages that mean I just can't go right back up" if orders
warrant, says Clarence Vensel of Bakerstown Container, a
steel-drum maker in Pennsylvania. Still, those who need
oil-related commodities worry despite the safeguards of
forward contracts, crackerjack computer inventory control and
stockpiles. "If the war goes on for a long time, or the oil
is bombed, we could be in for a lot of trouble," says one
benzene buyer.
   In December, inventories fell for the 25th consecutive
month, says NAPM.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Not for the same coffee table: Harry N. Abrams's

user-friendly system in its CQ-ID90 line of car radios. But other major
electronics manufacturers are expected to introduce their own smart products,
everything from home audio systems to VCRs and televisions.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The one thing these products will have in common is ID Logic circuitry, a
couple of computer chips that enable the electronic gadget to do the work of
finding your favorite station for you.;    Pierre Schwob, a Swiss inventor,
developed ID logic after searching for a classical radio station while on a
long ride through unfamiliar territory.;    "The idea came to me while I was
driving in a strange city," Schwob said last week from his hotel room in New
York, en route to Hong Kong. "I was fumbling with my radio dial and trying to
negotiate a corner and I said, 'There must be a better way.' ";    Schwob
determined that the better way would include a pair of computer chips
programmed by call letters with hundreds of radio stations nationwide.;    The
stations are then sorted by geographical locations, and cataloged once again
by format.;    You don't have to know what the classical station is where you
are. All you have to do is punch in the "classical" button on the radio and
the chips take over.;    ID Logic was introduced last year for a pricey $700
for Panasonic's CQ-ID90 car radio.;    But the price has come down a lot since
then. Panasonic's latest version, the CQ-ID60, retails for $300. This radio,
to be introduced in March, includes a pull-out feature that enables you to
store the radio in your trunk or some other out-of-sight spot. Schwob says
future car radios with ID logic could cost under $200 each.;    ID Logic won't
stop with car radios.;    Schwob is talking to JVC and Mitsubishi, among other
manufacturers, about incorporating the computer circuitry in televisions and
VCRs. He says Schwob says travelers in unfamiliar hotel rooms might press the
"news" button on televisions rather than fumble around for the local cable
news station.;    Schwob also says ID Logic would be useful in VCRs for those
who still haven't quite gotten the hang of programming their decks.;    With
ID Logic, you could program the VCR to record HBO by pressing the "HBO"
button. He also says ID Logic would have value on some of the new "personal"
electronic products, such as a Sony Walkman and that eventually, ID Logic
might increase the cost of a VCR or TV set by only $15 to $20.  </TEXT>

Interior and Local Government [DILG], said earlier today that 
the strength of the New People's Army [NPA] continues to 
diminish. Based on the latest statistics, the NPA rebels number 
only 8,300. Alunan added that the Philippine National Police 
and DILG are now ready to head the counterinsurgency campaign in 
1995: 
  [Begin Alunan recording in English, in progress] ...with the 
peace process. The strength of the NPA, for example, has 
dropped from 25,000 in 1987 to just 8,350 by 1993, or one third 
of its strength. In terms of firearms holdings, in 1987 they 
had a total inventory of 15,500; today, it is down to 
approximately 7,600. [end recording]

   This news story can tell your age.
   You're 50 or older if these words move you to memories of
staring at a mahogany box and hearing:
   _ ``Tain't funny, McGee.''
   _ ``Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. North America and all the ships
at sea. Let's go to press!''
   _ ``The house lights are being dimmed. In a moment, the great
gold curtain will go up.''
   _ ``Hi-yoo, Silver, awaaaay!''
   That, of course, was radio _ radio in its primest time, the
1940s and 1950s, when cities would fall silent and a visitor
strolling the tree-lined streets of middle America, on a summer's
evening, could catch, without missing a beat, the 15-minute drama
of Amos 'n' Andy pouring out of living room windows. In the
Depression years, one-third of a nation tuned in.
   A nostalgia-bathed exhibit opening Friday at the Smithsonian
Institution's National Portrait Gallery recalls the pioneers of
radio and television and the programs that generations of Americans
tuned in on and grew up with.
   The show's curator is Amy Henderson, a historian of the 19th
century who got her doctorate in Jefferson studies. She is a baby
boomer, and, although she thinks she remembers ``The Shadow''
(``Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?''), her earliest
firm memories are of television's Kuklapolitans and of the men in
gas station attendants' uniforms who used to bring on Milton Berle.
   ``It is nostalgia to you,'' she told a visitor 10 years her
senior. ``But it's history to me.''
   Off and on for five years, Ms. Henderson scoured the closets of
broadcasters for artifacts. She put the show together with help
from New York's Museum of Broadcasting. It will run through Jan. 2.
   The exhibit's museological purpose is not to wallow but ``to
trace the impact of radio and television personalities on American
culture'' from the turn of the century to the Kennedy-Nixon debate.
The museum says the inventions of radio and television are about as
important as Columbus' landing in the New World.
   Visitors will watch televisions giving snippets of early
broadcasts, such as Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, paired up for
the first time to cover the 1956 political conventions. They stayed
together to serve up the news for many years. Their signoff _
``Good night, Chet.'' ``Good night, David.'' _ became a national
coda, recited in schoolyards.
   There's familiar stuff here. A boyish Brinkley drily comments,
in a 1956 snippet, that the delegates did not clear the aisles when
the chair asked them to clear the aisles. No doubt, he made the
same observation this summer, eight pairs of conventions later.
   Dave Garroway is there, too, at the first ``Today'' show, with
J. Fred Muggs, a chimpanzee who bit everyone. His palm upraised,
Garroway signs off again saying ``Peace.'' In 1952, television at 7
a.m. was a radical idea.
   The exhibit offers artifacts of broadcasting: a Kate Smith gown,
a Howdy Doody puppet, Rudy Vallee's megaphone, Sid Caesar's German
Professor costume, a bejeweled Liberace outfit, Garroway's bowtie.
It's a clip-on.
   Radio buffs get to see what they did not need to see _
photographs of those who widened their world. They get to see the
device that created an awful racket when Fibber McGee reached for
the door to the hall closet at 79 Wistful Vista, and millions of
Americans, at their radios, tensed. What made that noise of a
closetful of possessions falling atop Fibber was a chicken-wire
covered barrel, churned by a sound effects man.
   Fibber's wife, Molly, would respond, ``Tain't funny, McGee,''
and people everywhere chuckled because it was funny.
   As for those other catchlines of radio:
   _ ``Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. North America and all the ships
at sea.'' That was Walter Winchell, the inventor of the gossip
column, signing on for 15 minutes of frenzied chatter, his finger
clattering a telegraph key between items, and hot news introduced
with a barked ``Flash!'' Twenty million people tuned in.
   _ ``The house lights are being dimmed.'' That would be Milton
Cross, introducing the Metropolitan Opera to a nationwide audience,
most members of whom probably never would see the inside of an
opera house. His virtuoso performance, every Saturday afternoon for
45 seasons, demonstrated the democratization of culture that radio
made possible.
   _ ``Hi-yoo, Silver, awaaaay!'' With that fading call, the Lone
Ranger, who fought evil in the old West with silver bullets,
galloped off. He and his ever-faithful Indian companion, Tonto,
played on radio for 2,956 episodes, from Jan. 30, 1933, to Sept. 3,
1954. They lasted on television from 1949 until 1957.
   Many entertainers couldn't make the move to the new medium.
   Funnyman Fred Allen was one who flopped on television. ``On a
radio broadcast, anything goes,'' he told Life magazine. ``You can
have a man walking up the side of a building like a spider. You
merely plant a suggestion in the listener's mind and his
imagination supplies all the details, all the scenery, props,
extras and costumes.''
   But, as for television, said the acerbic Allen: ``They call
television a medium because nothing on it is ever well done.''

  [Text] Moscow-Kiev -- Speaking to a UNIAN correspondent 
today, Russia's Ambassador-at-Large Yuriy Dubinin, who is 
heading the Russian state delegation at the negotiations on the 
Black Sea Fleet, refuted a Radio Liberty report which quoted him 
as saying that Russia has no intention of taking an inventory of 
the Black Sea Fleet, as well as a report by the same radio 
station on "Ukraine's reluctance to abide by last year's 
Massandra accords." Yuriy Dubinin refused to give his opinion 
on the fleet's inventory insisted on by the Ukrainian side but 
stressed that the issue is within the competence of the 
Ukrainian and Russian delegations. "Any attempts to turn the 
Black Sea Fleet negotiations into a shoot-out by unilateral and 
public statements will have little effect," he said. 
"Undoubtedly, [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk's proposals 
on the fleet will be discussed. The final date for a meeting 
between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations has not yet been 
set." 
  Speaking on the Black Sea Fleet issue, Ukraine's former 
defense minister, Kostyantyn Morozov, told UNIAN today that the 
sides must first fulfill their previous obligations. "The fleet 
must be divided by 1995, and its non-Ukrainian part must leave 
the territory of Ukraine, in which Russia can count on our 
assistance," Kostyantyn Morozov stressed. "I am convinced it 
would be unreasonable to drag this problem into the next 
century." He also emphasized the lack of grounds behind 
Moscow's allegations that Ukraine is not abiding by the 
Massandra accords. "We don't know any such accords. The 
Russian side means the verbal agreements between Presidents 
Leonid Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin which are not accords as such 
but merely a reflection of their common view on the negotiation 
process." The main premise in this process, the former minister 
believes, should be Ukraine's legislation and security.

<HEAD>Army Speeds Plan to Shield Helicopters Against Radio Wave
Interference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has decided to accelerate plans to
shield a key control unit in the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter against
radio wave interference after a test incident earlier this month in
Europe, a spokesman said Friday.
   The May 11 incident, in which a Blackhawk flying near a huge
antenna farm banked into a right-hand turn for five seconds without
any pilot commands, also has prompted the Army to instruct its
pilots to keep clear of a handful of radio antenna installations in
West Germany.
   Although the May 11 incident has raised new concerns about the
effects of so-called electromagnetic interference on the Blackhawk,
extensive testing has convinced the service it is still dealing
with a ``nuisance'' problem and not a phenomenon that affects
flight safety, said Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman.
   ``We certainly are not going to ground the fleet, because
there's no reason to do so,'' Soucy added.
   But Soucy said the Army intends to accelerate its plans to add
shielding to the electronic controls on the craft's hydraulic
control system because of the test results. The service already had
opened talks with the helicopter's manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft,
on shielding a number of electronic components ``because our pilots
shouldn't have to worry about nuisance'' signal interference, Soucy
said.
   Last November, Knight-Ridder Newspapers reported investigators
were convinced radio wave interference had caused five Blackhawk
accidents since 1982, killing 22 servicemen.
   ``Radio waves in the air can penetrate the helicopter's wiring
and electrical components and generate false commands that can
range from simply causing the craft's warning lights to flash to
sending it into a fatal dive,'' the report said.
   The Army and Sikorsky, a subsidiary of the United Technologies
Corp., adamantly disputed that report, saying there was no evidence
electromagnetic interference had caused any crashes.
   The service had acknowledged earlier that radio wave
interference could cause ``uncommanded control inputs,'' moving the
helicopter's horizontal stabilator slightly, but not to the extent
of posing a flight safety hazard. There is a switch in the cockpit
that allows a pilot to assume manual control of the stabilator, the
Army says.
   Last month, a Blackhawk operating near a large array of
high-intensity antennas in West Germany experienced some unusual
blinking lights and alarm horns, Soucy said. The Army then
attempted to replicate that incident with special instruments and
test pilots.
   On May 11, during a test, ``the aircraft turned to the right on
its own for about five seconds while flying near the antenna
farm,'' Soucy said. ``We believe the hydraulic logic module inside
the Blackhawk was being affected.''
   The spokesman declined to say how close the helicopter was
flying to the antenna farm, but said it was transmitting with a
combined power in excess of 400 million watts of power.
   While the test suggests that large levels of electromagnetic
interference actually can affect the controls of the Blackhawk,
``the effect is very brief'' and doesn't pose a threat of losing
control of the copter, Soucy said.
   The Blackhawk is a twin-engine, single-rotor helicopter that is
replacing the aging UH-1 Huey copters of the Vietnam era as the
Army's primary air assault and air cavalry craft. It was introduced
in April 1981.
   The Army currently has more than 900 Blackhawks in its inventory
and plans to buy about 1,700 of the choppers. Each craft costs
roughly $6 million.

FT  07 JAN 94 / Radio tags may home in on supermarkets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists have developed an electronic system capable of identifying
individual items of travellers' luggage or scanning an entire basket of
supermarket items.
'Supertag' will be launched formally next week. It has been developed by the
South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in conjunction
with the British Technology Group, employing a technique used originally to
monitor livestock in transit.
BTG executives foresee a broad range of applications for the system but
accept that its early use in supermarkets is unlikely because of cost.
The technology, called radio tagging, is already widely used for security.
Ford, for example, builds radio tags made by Texas Instruments into the
locks of some of its latest cars. Texas Instruments is one of the world's
largest producers of radio tags.
The principle is simple. A silicon chip containing a unique number is
embedded in the product. A radio beam is directed at the chip. This powers
the chip, enabling it to respond by sending back its number. Transmitted,
say, to a an in-store computer, the information could be used to price a
basket of goods and provide information about inventory.
The problem to date has been reading more than one number simultaneously.
Supertag overcomes this using three scanners and a technique derived from
computer networking. Radio tags are expensive, however, costing from 60p to
Pounds 1.80. Mr Peter Hawkes of BTG said Supertag would not be feasible in
supermarkets until the price per tag fell to less than a penny.
Mr Douglas Etheridge of ICL, a leading manufacturer of retailing systems,
said there was intense interest in ways of making supermarket check-outs
more efficient. Radio scanning was a prime contender and he would be
examining the Supertag system carefully.
Texas Instruments said the system would be a huge advance if it was as fast
as the BTG said, but the company was sceptical about the claimed
performance.
Supermarket chains gave a lukewarm reception to the prospect of electronic
scanners being able to reduce queues and allow staff cuts.
Ms Sue Spencer of Tesco said: 'I have heard the report. We are always
interested in technological advances. I am sure our development people are
looking at the latest idea. But there are no immediate plans to introduce
scanners which read the contents of a trolley.'
Ms Spencer doubted that if a new scanning system were brought in tomorrow it
would mean significant reductions in staff. She said: 'Anyone saved from the
check-out could be deployed elsewhere.'
Ms Prue Raper for J. Sainsbury was also sceptical about potential staff
savings, saying: 'We are going back to more labour-intensive operations and
away from self-service.'

for beginning operators.;    The rule change takes effect today.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  FLASH! SOME MORSE CODE RULES DASHED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The FCC issues five classes of licenses to ham radio operators: novice,
technician, general, advanced and amateur extra.;    Only the technician-class
license will be available to those who cannot use the Morse code. The four
other classes still require some code proficiency.;    The novice class might
be more attractive for beginners who already know the Morse code because its
written exam is less extensive than the one required for technician class.;   
To keep operators interested in the hobby, the commission has an incentive
system linking each class of license to different ranges of radio frequencies.
As amateurs move up the license ladder, they gain access to better frequencies
and to more operators worldwide.;    Of the 450,000 amateur radio operators in
the United States, about 112,000 have technician-class licenses.;    Because
amateur operators function as emergency communicators, they are required to
know the Morse code by the International Telecommunications Union in Geneva,
the United Nations world broadcasting authority.;    But in practice, most
countries only partly abide by those rules. While some ham operators continue
to use the Morse code, most say voice and computer communications are quicker
and much more convenient.;    "Morse code is no longer an integral part of ham
radio service," said Luck Hurder, deputy manager of field services for the
American Radio Relay League, the largest ham radio association in the United
States.;    Many ham radio enthusiasts say that dropping the Morse code
requirement will make the hobby more accessible.;    The FCC is mandated under
the Radio Act of 1912 to get young people interested in amateur radio, because
it provides a base in electronics and engineering.;    But the United States
is one of a handful of countries that has enforced the International
Telecommunications Union's Morse code rule.;    When Japan dropped the
requirement several years ago, the average age of its amateur operators
dropped to the mid-20s. In the United States, the average age of ham operators
is 55.;    The Morse code, invented in 1835 by Samuel F.B. Morse, has been
used to transmit emergency messages, including the famous cry for help: SOS.; 
  But in 1988, the International Maritime Organization began a five-year
phasing out of the Morse code on ships, replacing it with a radio signal panic
button.  </TEXT>

   Emerson Radio Corp., citing continuing weakness in
consumer spending, said it expects to report a "substantial"
loss for its fiscal third quarter.
   The North Bergen, N.J., maker of consumer electronics
products also said it has hired Lehman Brothers, a unit of
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., as financial adviser for
debt-restructuring talks with its lenders, and to review
financial alternatives for the company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Emerson said the anticipated loss will result from
additions to reserves and a "sizable" one-time charge for
expenses in reducing its inventory. No further details were
provided. It said nine-month losses also were expected to be
substantial.
   In the year-earlier third quarter, Emerson Radio earned
$4.5 million, or 13 cents a share, on sales of $229.9
million.
   Emerson also said it was changing its fiscal year to end
Dec. 31 from March 31, reflecting a decision taken by senior
management after their review of operations.
   Emerson designs and markets a full line of consumer
electronic products.

'TALK,' 'PIRATE' STATIONS WAGE WAR OVER ID TAGS

Radio wars are being waged these days not only over the airwaves but also in 
courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
KABC-AM (790) has filed a lawsuit against KFI-AM (640) over the use of its 
"talk radio" moniker, while KQLZ-FM (100.3), which dubs itself "pirate radio," 
has threatened to sue a Philadelphia-based station over that nickname. 
</P>
<P>
KABC's suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court here, accuses KFI of trademark 
infringement, saying that KABC has the sole right to use the "talk radio" label 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing is scheduled Monday to determine whether a temporary restraining 
order will be issued against KFI. 
</P>
<P>
KABC said in its suit that it adopted its all-talk format in 1960 and, in 1972, 
"invented and adopted the trademark and trade name 'KABC Talk Radio.' KABC has 
used 'KABC Talk Radio' as its trademark and trade name since 1972 and has 
invested millions of dollars in advertising, marketing and promoting its 
services under that name and mark." 
</P>
<P>
The suit said that KABC was the only station to use the talk radio label for 17 
years and that it used the term on the air "on over 500,000 separate 
occasions." 
</P>
<P>
"Early in 1989, KFI used as its identifying name 'Talkin' Southern California.' 
In March, 1989, without obtaining authorization or consent from KABC, KFI began 
to identify itself as "Talk Radio" and/or KFI Talk Radio," the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
KFI officials said that the term "talk radio" does not belong to any one 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"We use a variety of lines to distinguish ourselves as a talk-radio station, 
but the fact remains that we are a talk-radio station, and for one station in 
the market to actually lay claim to a generic term is ludicrous," said program 
director George Oliva. 
</P>
<P>
KFI attorney Michael Bierman said that the phrase "talk radio" is generic 
because it refers to a kind of programming format used by many radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Philadelphia station WIOQ-FM reacted similarly when they received 
a letter from attorneys for KQLZ asking that they stop using the term "pirate 
radio." 
</P>
<P>
Program director Mark Driscoll said that the station uses 37 slogans. Its 
premier slogan is "renegade of the air waves," he said, and the pirate name is 
connected with its renegade image. "We give out pirate paraphernalia -- eye 
patches, planks and swords," he said. 
</P>
<P>
They have not stopped using the slogan since receiving a "cease and desist" 
letter earlier this week, he said, and do not intend to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's absurd that someone could walk around and say 'pirate' is 
theirs," Driscoll said. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do -- go around the country and chase down everybody 
that uses 'hot,' 'power' or 'magic'?" he asked. "Are they going to sue 
everybody?" 
</P>
<P>
Eric Weiss, vice president of legal and business affairs for Westwood One, 
which owns KQLZ and only began using the "Pirate Radio" moniker March 17, said 
Wednesday that the company is seeking to stop its use in Philadelphia because 
it plans to market the KQLZ format on a national basis in the next few months.

FT  24 OCT 92 / When radar went bump in the night: Wilfred Harper recalls a
key move by Britain's wartime scientists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILFRED HARPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTY years ago some of Britain's top scientists took over Malvern College
in Worcestershire. The move was undertaken with great haste, in deep secrecy
and amid farcical chaos. The scientists were ordered to move by Winston
Churchill's because they and their existing laboratories were at risk of
attack.
A little while before a British parachute commando force had raided a German
radar station on a cliff-top north of Le Havre in occupied France. They
overpowered it, ripped out the vital components of the Wurzburg radar,
carried them down to the beach, loaded them on to boats and whisked them
away in the darkness. Back in England the trophies were examined by
scientists.
The success of the raid both pleased and alarmed the Telecommunications
Research Establishment. Its radar laboratories were near the cliff-top at St
Albans Head, in Dorset, overlooking the English Channel. A similar raid by
the Germans could have been disastrous. It seemed prudent to move out before
the Germans came in.
The chosen home for TRE was far inland, technically suitable and very
attractive. Under protest, the staff and pupils of Malvern College were
evacuated to Harrow School.
During the move there were moments of farce. Lorries full of highly secret
equipment left under the protection of Dorset Home Guard. However, the local
commander refused to allow his mens' firearms over the county border. The
lorries continued unguarded and unguided lost their way on the un-signposted
roads and ended up in a farmyard.
After the upheaval the scientists settled down among the Victorian Gothic
tracery in the shadow of the Malvern Hills. There they developed the
'instruments of darkness' without which the Allies might not have won the
war.
Radar's military history had been short but spectacular.
It began in Britain with a report to the Air Defence Committee of February
1935 entitled Detection of Aircraft by Radio Methods by Robert Watson-Watt,
the Superintendent of the Radio Department at the National Physical
Laboratory.
The Committee requested a demonstration. Watson-Watt's assistant quickly
wired together some equipment, loaded it into a caravan and towed it to a
place near the BBC's short wave radio transmitter at Daventry. An old bomber
was flown about and its radio reflections were picked up and displayed. The
committee was convinced.
Immediately, and secretly, money was made available and some of Britain's
brightest scientists were recruited. Unknown to each other several countries
were working on radio detection, notably Germany, France, the US and Japan.
The British dubbed the system Radar, an acronym for Radio Detection and
Ranging.
So rapid was its translation into operational hardware that Neville
Chamberlain's aeroplane to Munich in September 1938 was tracked down the
Thames Estuary by five radar stations. By Easter 1939 a chain of 20 stations
looped around the British coast from the Firth of Tay to the Isle of Wight.
Without its early warning the British would have lost the Battle of Britain
and probably the war.
With the Luftwaffe repelled, TRE concentrated on radar for offensive
purposes. This is the work which came to fruition at Malvern. It was largely
based on a crucial invention of 1940, the cavity magnetron. This enabled the
reduction of pulse wavelengths from metres to centimetres, which in turn
enabled considerable extension and enhancement of radar's abilities. (The
same device generates microwaves in ovens).
The magnetron was used in advanced airborne radar. By 1942 the big bombers,
the Halifaxes, Sterlings and Lancasters, were in service and with them came
the 1,000-bomber night raids. These required an on-board electronic
navigation system for target finding to replace the system based on signals
transmitted from Britain, which were of limited range and could be jammed.
Bernard Lovell, a young university physicist, was in charge of its
development. His team developed a ground scanning system which displayed
features such as cities and coast lines. Hamburg, a city on an estuary, was
its first target in January 1943. Nearly 40 years later a derivative, aboard
a Vulcan, was used for a raid against Port Stanley airfield in the
Falklands.
Another airborne system enabled night fighters to close in on enemy aircraft
after initial guidance by ground radar.
By the spring of 1943 German submarines were sinking almost 1m tons of
Allied shipping a month and threatening Britain's supply lines. A
newly-developed airborne radar enabled Coastal Command aircraft to find and
attack the U-boats, often at night when they were on the surface recharging
batteries. Soon U-Boats were being destroyed faster than the Germans could
replace them. Shipping losses fell by 90 per cent.
Sir Bernard Lovell is now in his late 70s. Recently he attended the
dedication of a memorial window at Goodrich Castle near Malvern, close to
the place where a Halifax bomber crashed 50 years ago. It was testing one of
his prototype radars. All the scientists aboard and the aircrew died.
It is impossible to describe all the systems and counter measures developed
during the first radar war. Radar warfare has come a long way, as we saw
during the Gulf conflict.

TELEVISION ON THE MOVE; 
</P>
<P>
IN-CAR VIDEO SCREEN SMALL BUT CRITICS QUESTION SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD E. DUENSING, Duensing is a free-lance writer based in Milford, N.J. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the near future, motorists may see something entirely new when they look at 
their windshields -- a television show that appears to float above the road. It 
may sound farfetched, but Jay Schiffman, an electrical engineer at Auto Vision 
Associates in Ferndale, Mich., has recently received a patent for a device that 
could make it possible. 
</P>
<P>
Called AutoVision, the video system consists of a tiny mirror positioned on the 
windshield above the driver's line of sight to reflect the picture shown by a 
small projector located near the dome light. "The whole thing depends on the 
size, position, and the shape of the mirror," Schiffman said. "It is small 
enough to see around, mounted high enough on the windshield to see under, and 
the curve of its surface creates the illusion that the television image is 
hovering about 15 feet in front of the car." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the feasibility of the technology, the obvious question of the safety of 
a car TV is already being debated by experts. The consensus so far is that the 
device appears to be safe but is not without potential dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Its safety hinges on the optical illusion it creates, called a "virtual image" 
by psychologists, which makes AutoVision's TV image seem to be just another 
part of the landscape. It is as if a small piece of the scenery had been cut 
out and a television screen put in its place. The illusion also makes the 
picture seem much larger than it actually is, allowing the driver to watch the 
screen comfortably without it monopolizing his attention. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to whatever else the driver wishes to view, a small video camera 
mounted near AutoVision's projection unit is pointed at the dashboard and feeds 
the projector. The device is used to display a picture of the dashboard onto 
the screen. By selecting this option, drivers can check their speed, adjust the 
air conditioning, or even tune the radio without taking their eyes off the 
road. This type of readout, known as a "head-up display," has been used on jet 
fighters for over 30 years, and is claimed to make the operation of supersonic 
aircraft safer by allowing pilots to check their instruments while still 
watching where they are going. 
</P>
<P>
People who have tested AutoVision say the matchbook-size mirror blocks far less 
of the windshield than the sun visor and is no more distracting than the 
overhead signs on a highway. However, the real magic of this invention may be 
the fact that it concentrates driver attention on the road ahead. "The view of 
the road surrounding the television image always remains in focus," the 
inventor said, "and a driver whose interest is captured by what is going on in 
front of the car is not likely to let his eyes wander off the road." 
</P>
<P>
The panel of independent psychologists and traffic safety specialists now 
evaluating the device for AutoVision generally agree that there is little 
danger in having the mirror on the windshield. However, some members of the 
group have stressed the need for further research on what images should be 
shown and under what conditions the device should be used. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have no objection to using this device to display a picture of the 
dashboard," said Dr. Herschel Leibowitz, an experimental psychologist at 
Pennsylvania State University, who has tested AutoVision. "I can even see how 
the television function might be beneficial in stimulating drivers who are 
bored and in danger of falling asleep. However, misuse might be dangerous, 
especially if the driver was drinking, or was distracted in heavy traffic or 
with pedestrians present." 
</P>
<P>
The objection that watching television while driving will distract drivers and 
delay their reactions is the most common criticism of AutoVision. But Schiffman 
said, "We have been testing AutoVision for several years, and over 200 people 
have driven the prototype cars a total of 175,000 miles without a single 
incident. Our experience and research have shown that when a person watching 
AutoVision sees a potential hazard in the same visual area as the screen, he 
automatically shifts his attention to the problem. The first call of mankind is 
to preserve its own skin. It is a natural reaction." 
</P>
<P>
A driver can watch AutoVision and drive at the same time because most of the 
information needed to follow a television program comes from the audio portion 
of the broadcast. "You do a sort of time sharing, and actually look at the 
screen only a small fraction of the time," explains the inventor. "But even 
when you glance at the picture to fill in some details, everything on the road 
ahead remains in full view and completely in focus." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for AutoVision first came to Schiffman while he was doing research on 
head-up display units designed for aircraft. In order to discover how these 
displays might be distracting to pilots, he installed one in a panel truck and 
began driving with it. "The electronics for that first unit took up almost the 
entire back of the truck, and while the research I wanted to do was never 
funded, I did discover that if I put the right type of image in the right 
location, I could safely drive while watching television." 
</P>
<P>
As his work progressed, and with the advent of transistors and printed 
circuits, Schiffman reduced the dimensions of the projection unit to the size 
of a book. 
</P>
<P>
He also developed other types of head-up displays, such as the Bendix Blind 
Landing System (to which he holds the patent), a device that allows pilots 
flying in fog to see an electronically generated image of the runway they are 
approaching. But even with this impressive background, he had to work at 
convincing scientists, traffic officials and investors that his invention was 
practical. "Most of them found the idea of AutoVision hard to believe, but when 
I got them in a car and let them drive with it, they immediately saw its 
possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Schiffman believes that the story of AutoVision could very well parallel that 
of the car radio. In 1929, Bill Lear (later of jet aircraft fame) presented his 
boss, Paul Galvin, with the first radio designed for use in an automobile. 
Galvin's immediate response was, "They'll never be allowed in cars. There will 
be laws against them." But Lear was determined, and despite predictions from 
traffic authorities in Washington that there would be nationwide bans on car 
radios, his invention was a success and formed the basis of what would later 
become the Motorola Corp. Some cities actually did pass laws against using 
radios while driving, but every one of these laws was eventually repealed, and 
today 95% of all cars are equipped with a radio. 
</P>
<P>
With 300 million motor vehicles now operating worldwide and 30 million new cars 
being built each year, the economic possibilities for AutoVision are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
"If the safety issues are resolved, the market for AutoVision should be similar 
to the one for car stereo systems," said Ron Pherigo of the American 
Electronics Assn. But others fear that this is another multibillion-dollar 
industry that could be lost if the fear of liability suits forces the 
technology overseas, to Europe or Japan, where few laws exist that would limit 
the use of the device. 
</P>
<P>
The safety consultants and traffic officials who have begun to evaluate 
AutoVision believe that some form of the apparatus could be used in cars in the 
near future. But no one is sure exactly what we will see when we look at that 
tiny screen. Some recommend that video cameras be used to televise the blind 
spots between a car's mirrors, while others suggest that maps could be 
projected on the screen and the car's location plotted by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
"I can imagine it being used as an entertainment device, but with carefully 
defined programming," said Prof. D. Alfred Owens, a psychologist specializing 
in human perception and traffic safety at Franklin and Marshall College. "This 
device provides an opportunity to develop an entirely new mode of broadcasting 
that considers the driver's situation and actually enhances driver attention." 
</P>
<P>
If the television option is proved safe for widespread use, proponents say, 
AutoVision will change the way we experience driving. It can make extended 
trips seem shorter, calm people caught in traffic jams and even keep drivers 
alert during long, boring trips. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we need to know about this device can be researched," Owens said. 
"In fact, if you will pardon the pun, this new technology is going to drive us 
to learn more about how humans operate automobiles."

FT  03 NOV 92 / Technology: Printed circuit pioneer - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Eisler, who died last week aged 85, was a prolific inventor whose major
technological innovation - the printed circuit - accelerated the development
of modern electronics. That he amassed neither great wealth nor fame as a
consequence of his ingenuity seems to have been a product both of his times
and of his somewhat nave and remote personality.
Financial reward was rarely at the forefront of his thoughts; he thought of
printed circuits primarily as his contribution to Britain's war effort. A
Viennese Jew, Eisler left Austria in 1936 ahead of the rising Nazi tide and
settled in England where he was to remain for the rest of his life.
His career, while busy and eventful, was also dogged by disappointment and
rejection although he betrayed few signs of bitterness in his 1989
autobiography.
Eisler's genius was both theoretical and practical; not only did he see that
the tangled mass of wires which characterised electrical circuits in the
first half of the century could be replaced by metallic tracks bonded to an
insulating layer, his experience in printing technology led him to develop a
manufacturing method, foil etching, which is still in use today. His work
led to miniaturisation, to the integrated circuit or silicon chip and, most
important, to the low-cost mass production of electronic circuitry.
He remembers showing a radio he constructed using one of the first printed
circuits to Plessey in 1936. The company rejected it on the grounds that it
would replace women on the production line.
Eisler reserved his animosity for bureaucrats who got in the way of
invention, harbouring special disgust for the National Research Development
Corporation, founded by the Labour government in 1949 to commercialise the
products of publicly funded research.
'The treatment which my inventions received from the NRDC has made me wonder
again and again why this organisation has been so grossly inefficient in
doing the job for which Parliament had created it,' he wrote, concluding
that political games sapped the energies of its officers so they could not
deal sensibly with inventors and inventions.

Noble Broadcast Group's $200-million bid for two radio networks, a deal that 
would have put the San Diego-based radio chain in the front rank in number of 
U. S. listeners, has been turned down, Noble chairman John Lynch said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Noble said the offer for New York-based United Stations and 
Colorado Springs-based Transtar is still on the table and he is optimistic that 
his company and the networks will come to an agreement "down the road." The 
deal has been in negotiations for three months and has been followed widely in 
the broadcast industry. 
</P>
<P>
United Stations President Nick Verbitsky acknowledged the offer Wednesday, 
saying only that "we talk to a lot of people, and we get offers all the time." 
Verbitsky, who with Dick Clark is a principal shareholder of United, said "your 
guess is as good as mine" when asked the chances of striking a deal with Noble. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing Noble owns 18 radio stations, including XTRA-FM and AM in San 
Diego, up from two stations four years ago. To raise equity capital for the 
purchase of the networks, Nobel last month sold two Boston stations, WSSH-AM 
and FM, to a group led by entertainer Merv Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said Noble's long-term goal is to own a major radio network in order to 
better exercise control over Noble's "inventory," or programming, and Noble 
will continue to look for suitable network acquisitions. Noble also plans to 
acquire more stations over the next year or two to reach the maximum 24 
stations allowed by the Federal Communications Commission, Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
31 Weekly Programs 
</P>
<P>
Closely held United Stations bought the RKO radio network in April 1985 and 
also owns a programming production company, Verbitsky said. The network 
produces about 31 weekly programs, including Dick Clark's weekly Top 40 
countdown show, that are sold to 1,200 affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
Transtar sells eight 24-hour radio formats, ranging from Top 40 and Golden 
Oldies to country-western and big band, which are fed to 1,400 affiliate 
stations via satellite. Transtar also produces a rock-'n'-roll countdown show 
featuring comedian John Candy and owns a radio market-research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Transtar principals C. T. Robinson and Bill Moyes were unavailable for comment 
Wednesday.

<HL> NBC Seeks to Sell Radio Group; 'Limited Number' of Firms in Talks </HL>

   NEW YORK -- General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit said it is in preliminary talks with "a limited number of companies" to sell its entire radio group, the business on which NBC was founded. 

   The sale of NBC's radio group would take it out of a business it has been in since the company's formation in 1926. 
The sale would be a switch of strategy for NBC, which had first said it would "reconfigure" its radio business by selling some stations and purchasing others. 

   NBC's radio group includes a total of eight stations. 
The company soon will close on the previously announced $13 million sale of WMAQ-AM in Chicago. 
Currently, NBC is in separate talks with a potential buyer about the sale of WKYS-FM in Washington, said Randall D. Bongarten, president of NBC's radio division. 
Consultants say that station is NBC's single most profitable station. 

   But NBC, acquired with its parent RCA Corp. by General Electric in 1986, had been expected to hold onto at least some of its six other stations -- two in New York, two in San Francisco, one in Boston and an FM station in Chicago. 

   NBC's Mr. Bongarten wouldn't disclose the few prospective buyers involved in the talks, in which NBC is represented by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
He said "there isn't a firm price tag." 

   But radio consultant Robert Mounty of Mounty Communications, who had been the NBC radio group's No. 2 executive until last year, estimated the network could get $150 million for seven of NBC's eight stations. 
For WKYS-FM in Washington, Mr. Mounty believes the network could receive an additional $45 million. 

   "These stations are among the finest physical facilities in the country, and many of them have great birthrights in the business," Mr. Mounty said. 

   NBC dates back to 1926, when RCA Corp. formed it and purchased what now is New York's WNBC-AM in the hope that starting a radio-station business would help build consumer demand for RCA-made radios. 
Of NBC's eight stations, only WJIB in Boston is a recent purchase, made in 1983; the rest were acquired by 1948. 

   Mr. Bongarten of NBC was said to have told top managers of the network's radio stations this week that the group sale was being discussed. 
He wouldn't say yesterday when an agreement might be reached. 
"Those things need to be fluid." 

   NBC began reviewing its radio operations in mid-1987. 
Disposing of its old-line radio business would be in keeping with the oft-stated strategy of General Electric Chairman Jack F. Welch, who has said GE should remain only in businesses in which it can be a No. 1 or No. 2 player. 
By August, NBC had sold its "radio-network" business, which supplies programming to independent stations, to Westwood One Inc. for $50 million. 

   But NBC also is pressured by federal regulations prohibiting a company from owning television and radio stations in the same city. 
NBC had been exempt because it owned the stations long before the rule was adopted. 
But the exemption ended when General Electric became the new owner of NBC. 
The Federal Communications Commission then granted a temporary waiver of the rule. 
Company spokesmen weren't sure yesterday exactly when that waiver will expire.

  [Text] Yes, brother listeners, both at home and abroad: 
This is the truth that refutes the inventions of the al-Ahmar 
clan and its lying media, the truth which makes plain that the 
al-'Anad base will remain steadfast and will not be contaminated 
by the feet of the soldiers of the oppressive al-Ahmar family. 
Greetings to our heroes of our Armed Forces of unity, democracy 
and national modernization which have shown such heroism in 
defeating and pursuing the (?defeated) remnants of the 
traitorous al-Ahmar family.

   Mel Blanc, who entertained generations of
cartoon viewers as the voice of Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Barney
Rubble, Tweety and hundreds of other characters, died Monday
following a lengthy hospital stay. He was 81.
   The creator of such classic cartoon trademarks as Bugs Bunny's
``Eh, what's up, Doc?'' Porky Pig's ``Th-th-th-th-that's all
f-f-f-folks'' and Road Runner's ``Beep, Beep'' died at 2:30 p.m.
from complications of heart disease and other ailments at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise.
   He had been suffering from cardiac problems and emphysema when
admitted May 19.
   Blanc performed the voices on 850 cartoons for Warner Bros. in a
career spanning more than 50 years. His versatility was so profound
that few would have presumed just one actor was behind so many
markedly different characters. He also performed voices on countless
other cartoons, such as ``The Flintstones'' for Hanna-Barbera, and
commercials and radio fillers.
   In an interview last November, he estimated he had done 900
voices in all.
   ``Those voices were part of him, and he loved every moment of
it,'' said his son, Noel. ``When the kids would come to the door or
in the studio, he became those characters.''
   Blanc made a car commercial on the day he went into the hospital
``and the last thing he said on the commerical _ the only thing he
said _ was `That's all folks,' and that's the last thing that was
recorded on tape,'' his son said.
   ``The reservoir of Hollywood legends is extremely low, and Mel
Blanc's passing is a deep personal loss,'' said longtime friend
Mickey Rooney.
   Working decades before the advent of high-tech sound effects,
Blanc was a human synthesizer and a verbal computer. It has been
estimated that more than 20 million people hear his voices daily.
   Blanc had a ``magnificently versatile voice,'' said Robert A.
Daly, Warner's chairman and chief executive officer. ``Bugs Bunny,
Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, Sylvester the Cat, Tweety and so many more _
they were all Mel Blanc.''
   Besides Warner Bros., Blanc worked for other animated film
makers, playing the part of the hyperactive, yammering Dino, Fred
Flintstone's pet dinosaur. Within the industry he was known as ``The
Man of a Thousand Voices.''
   Blanc said he once tried to count all the cartoon voices he did,
while recuperating in 1961 from a near-fatal car accident. He said
he fell asleep shortly after passing the 400 mark.
   Blanc's last cartoon contribution came with 1988's popular
animation-live action film, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' in which he
did the voices of Daffy, Tweety, Bugs and Sylvester. He wrote an
autobiography that year, ``That's Not All, Folks: My Life in the
Golden Age of Cartoons and Radio.''
   Blanc also played the voice of the robot Twiki on the live-action
television series ``Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.''
   Blanc said in an interview last year that Bugs Bunny _ originally
called Happy Rabbit _ was his favorite. ``Everybody knows who I am,
Doc,'' he said in the character's voice. ``I don't cayuh where dey
are who dey are. Even in Mars dey know about me.''
   Born in San Francisco on May 30, 1908, and raised in Portland,
Ore., Blanc discovered his vocal skills while in grammar school.
   He began his career in show business both as a musician and a
radio perfomer. He started in 1927, when he sang and performed on a
Portland radio show called ``The Hoot Owls.''
   He and his wife, Estelle Rosenbaum, subsequently wrote, produced
and performed all the characters for the daily radio show ``Cobwebs
and Nuts.''
   In 1928, Blanc _ who played the bass, violin and sousaphone _ was
hired by the NBC Radio Orchestra in San Francisco.
   Starting in 1937, he became part of Warner Bros.' cartoon studio,
which produced one short feature subject each week.
   His first Warner Bros. character was a drunken bull in the Looney
Tunes short ``Picador Porky.'' As legend has it, the actor playing
Porky Pig in that short actually did stutter. A few months later,
Blanc took over the role in ``Porky's Duck Hunt,'' stuttering
intact, and created Daffy Duck at the same time.
   Blanc introduced Bugs Bunny in the 1940 short ``A Wild Hare,''
giving the cartoon rabbit a combination Bronx and Brooklyn accent.
   Blanc invented the voices of such well-known cartoon figures as
Woody Woodpecker, Speedy Gonzalez, Pepe Le Pew, Tasmanian Devil,
Road Runner, Foghorn Leghorn, Heathcliffe the cat, Speed Buggy and
Yosemite Sam.
   He also did voices for Mr. Spacely on ``The Jetsons'' and the
Frito Bandito. In 1987, Blanc performed in the Daffy Duck short
``The Duxorcist,'' marking the return of Looney Tunes movie shorts
after a 20-year absence. He also worked on the 1988 short ``The
Night of the Living Duck,'' which kicked off the New York Film
Festival.
   Blanc said persistence paid off in landing the Warner Bros. job.
Frequent trips to the studio seeking an audition were met with
constant rejection by the personnel manager.
   ``That didn't stop me,'' Blanc said in a 1980 Associated Press
interview ``I kept going back every two weeks and always got the
same answer.
   ``Finally the guy died. The man who took his place decided to
give me a chance.''
   During Warner Bros. cartoon film short heydey, which lasted well
into the 1950s, few people in the United States recognized Blanc's
face, but hardly anyone was unfamiliar with his voices.
   From Sylvester's ``Thufferin' thuccotash!'' to Tweety's ``I tawt
I taw a puddy tat,'' Blanc's voice characterizations became
household tidbits of U.S. popular culture.
   Blanc called Bugs his favorite character, although he hated the
taste of carrots he chewed for sound effects and spit the uneaten
remains in the trash can.
   But for all his fame as the voices of cartoon characters, the
most Warner Bros. ever paid him for his vocal skills was $20,000,
and the studio retained the rights to the phrases Blanc invented.
   In addition to working in animation, he was a regular on radio's
``The Jack Benny Show,'' playing Professor LeBlanc, Benny's violin
teacher, and the train dispatcher who announced the stops of
``Ana-heim, A-zusa and KOOK-amunga!''
   Blanc also played Carmichael the Bear, Sy the Mexican gardener
and made the wheezing sounds of the timeworn 1924 Maxwell automobile
owned by Benny's skinflint comedy character.
   He reprised many of the roles when Benny moved to television.
   He married Miss Rosenbaum in 1933. Their son, Noel, was born five
years later. Blanc once said the only person who can imitate his
repertoire of cartoon voices was his son.
   Blanc is survived by his wife and son. Funeral arrangements were
pending.

BROADCASTING: IN A TOWN WHERE THE LIKES OF THOMAS ALVA EDISON AND GUGLIELMO 
MARCONI ONCE WORKED, A TOWN THAT WAS HOME TO NEW YORK'S FIRST REGULARLY 
LICENSED RADIO STATION, THE MESSAGE IS THE MEDIUM. JUST ASK MEMBERS OF THE 
ANTIQUE RADIO CLUB IN SCHENECTADY, N.Y., ONE OF ABOUT 30 SUCH GROUPS AROUND THE 
WORLD.

<TEXT>
<P>
The members of the Antique Radio Club aren't very impressed with a fancy 
computer during "Show and Tell," even if the palm-sized gadget does decipher 
Morse code at the speed of light. 
</P>
<P>
But when someone starts passing around a set of stained, yellowed photographs 
from 1915 depicting one of Schenectady's first amateur radio stations, a buzz 
of animated conversation fills the cramped basement where they are meeting. 
</P>
<P>
This is, after all, something the 15 radio buffs, most considerably advanced in 
age, can understand. Tenderly thumbing the pictures, Carmin Baker wrinkles his 
brow and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then, it was kind of a prestige thing to know, hey, the guy next door is 
a radio ham," Baker said. "We used to try to hang around him because we were 
interested in that kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The other silver-haired radio aficionados nod their heads. They've obviously 
come here to "get together with the other guys and see what they got and talk," 
as one member said. 
</P>
<P>
The Schenectady club, affiliated with the Rochester-based Antique Wireless 
Assn., is one of about 30 scattered around the world, according to Bruce 
Kelley, curator of the association's museum. All together, there are about 
10,000 antique or historical radio collectors, mostly in New York state, and of 
those 300 are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to transmit on 
the rare radios, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is something about the Schenectady organization that suggests 
that it is kind of special. 
</P>
<P>
"I built Langmuir's personal hi-fi set for him," said Robert Thayer, 73, 
referring to the Nobel Prize-winning chemist Irving Langmuir. "I put round 
knobs on the thing and he went crazy. He couldn't have a round knob. He wanted 
a pointer on there and he wanted to know where every one of the things was set. 
He didn't care how loud it was, but he wanted to know where that pointer was!" 
</P>
<P>
The memories come rushing back to these proud veterans of an era half a century 
ago when Schenectady, then home to the General Electric and American Locomotive 
companies, unabashedly called itself "the city that hauls and lights the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
They talk excitedly about an "intellectualism" that once permeated the 
"Electric City," located on the banks of the Mohawk River 15 miles northwest of 
Albany. Thomas Alva Edison started it all when he established his machine works 
in 1886, they said. Six years later, the two nondescript brick buildings would 
become GE. 
</P>
<P>
Besides jobs and prosperity, GE infused a much-needed dose of self-respect into 
a town that had too often been the butt of cruel jokes. The thankfully 
forgotten song, "I Can't Spell Schenectady," didn't seem fair to a thriving 
metropolis that had a lively downtown, huge department stores and a citizenry 
that included scientists such as Guglielmo Marconi. 
</P>
<P>
"Schenectady was a nice place to live back in the '20s. One of the nicest 
cities in the country," boasted club chairman Fay Eckert. "Well, they had the 
Erie Canal here for one thing, up to a point, anyway, which made it 
interesting. And it was such a clean city." 
</P>
<P>
But all this was before GE pulled out of the radio production business after 
World War II, quickly reducing its work force in Schenectady from a wartime 
high of 45,000 to 12,000. Many of the folks swapping memories at this reunion 
were among those thousands laid off. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, the locomotive company folded, giving a coup de grace to 
what had been a long downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, nobody comes to Schenectady any more," grumbled Francis Emrich, a private 
radio operator for 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's insistent voice rises above the din: "When I was a young man, everybody 
got out of college, went down to GE and got a job in the testing department." 
</P>
<P>
That's why he, like most of the others, started working for GE in 1940, earning 
35 cents an hour on an assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
This was a time when Schenectady breathed, ate and drank radio technology, 
Emrich recalled. The city's skyline bristled with the antennas of "ham" radio 
operators. As a matter of fact, Emrich said, GE used to give away tubes and 
other paraphernalia to hams, until unscrupulous individuals began to steal the 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Emrich is a purist, which means that he won't use anything but genuine parts in 
his antique radio transmitters. So, many times, he's had to search in some 
pretty odd places for spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
It seems natural to these people that New York's first regularly licensed radio 
station, WGY, which first broadcast in February, 1922, was started by GE in 
Schenectady. Television, also largely developed by GE, soon followed in 1939. 
If necessity was the mother of invention, then GE was the doctor that performed 
the delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The old radios the members avidly collect and lovingly restore are becoming 
scarce, such as the 1924 Westinghouse Nelson keeps in his cluttered cellar. Or 
the 1930s Atwater Kent that a beaming Ed Farrell showed off in the back of his 
van at the club's flea market before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, when we were kids, a kid that was just mildly interested in 
radio could take a crystal and a pair of earphones and some wire and make it 
work," said Thayer, his fingers wrapped around an odd-looking 1936 GE metal 
tube that he uses as a gavel. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, everything is so terrifically complicated that a kid has to be 
terrifically interested to get into it. He can't just start with a simple thing 
and work up."

<HL> Japanese Firm to Stop Selling TVs to GE
In Price Dispute Over Higher Yen Value
---

<TEXT>
   A big Japanese television maker will stop supplying color sets to General Electric Co. because of a dispute over how a sharply higher yen value should be reflected in the price. 

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Osaka, sought to increase prices on sets sold to GE for resale in the U.S. under the GE brand name. 
The price increase was necessary, Matsushita said, because of the significant rise in the yen's value against the dollar. 
But Fairfield, Conn.-based GE wanted a price reduction, Matsushita said. 
GE declined to comment on the reasons for the impasse. 

   The development may signal a stronger resolve by Japanese consumer electronics concerns to raise the price of goods that they sell in the U.S. Moreover, it may mark the beginning of significant gains in the U.S. market for consumer electronic products from South Korea and Taiwan, where currencies haven't experienced the sharp reevaluations that the yen has. 

   For GE, the move may lead to increased domestic production of televisions by its RCA Corp. unit. 
Before GE bought RCA, it had announced plans to stop making television sets. 

   With a 66% jump in the yen's value since its low in February 1985, Japanese manufacturing cost in dollars has climbed substantially. 
Theoretically, the price in dollars for Japanese goods should rise in response. 
Indeed, some companies increased prices last year but not enough to offset the strong yen; prices for consumers, however, in some cases, fell. 

   Some Japanese makers, including Matsushita, have attempted through efficiency gains to blunt the need for price increases. 
In an effort to maintain market share, some companies have also sliced profit margins rather than raise prices. 
"There has been an ongoing program of making every attempt to increase productivity," said a spokesman for Matsushita. 
"We have made every effort possible to improve distribution." 

   Yet the Matsushita-GE impasse indicates that some Japanese manufacturers may now have decided to draw the line. 
"There is a certain pressure point that you reach and we have reached it," the Matsushita spokesman said. 
"We could give no more." 
Matsushita also sells electronic products in the U.S. under the brand names Quasar, Panasonic and Technics. 

   David Lachenbruch, editorial director of Television Digest, a trade publication, said the development is "just the beginning" and predicted "tremendous upheaval" in the consumer electronics market. 
"The Japanese have been absorbing this change (in currency valuation), and they can't do it forever," he said. 
"Their shareholders won't let them." 
There clearly is pressure on some Japanese companies from an earnings standpoint. 
For example, Sony Corp.'s consolidated earnings tumbled 43% in the fiscal year ended Oct. 31 to the equivalent of $257 million. 

   Indeed, other evidence of the upheaval is already apparent as the industry begins to make adjustments. 
The most dramatic change appears to be the ascendency of other manufacturers, particularly South Korean concerns, to whom American consumer electronics companies are increasingly turning for supplies. 
For the 10 months ending Oct. 31, imports of fully assembled color televisions from South Korea rose 43.4% from the year-earlier period, while Japanese imports fell 4.9%, said Mr. Lachenbruch. 

   Emerson Radio Co., one of the nation's biggest importers of consumer electronics products, has changed suppliers "in a small number of cases," said Stephen Lane, president. 
There has been no wholesale switching, however, because the Japanese have been absorbing much of the effect of the rising yen. 
In addition, Emerson Radio has traditionally bought supplies from companies throughout the Orient, and has built currency hedges into its contracts to protect itself. 

   A spokesman for the U.S. arm of South Korea's Samsung Electronics Corp., said "we expect to be able to take advantage of this dollar yen problem" this year. 
Last year, Samsung said its opportunity to expand its U.S. market share was limited only by its inventories. 
"We could have sold everything we could have gotten our hands on," the spokesman said. 
"This year, we are in a much better supply situation." 

   In GE's case, the company said one of its options is to seek supplies elsewhere, presumably including other nations. 

   Ironically, in an effort to adjust to the higher yen values, even the Japanese are turning to South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore for supplies, industry officials said. 
"The Japanese are using Korean manufacturing to build some of their components," said the spokesman for Samsung, which is supplying some Japanese firms. 

   Moreover, most major Japanese concerns have rapidly moved production, or at least, final assembly, to the U.S. Sony, for example, has announced plans to expand its color-TV plant in San Diego, Calif. 
Matsushita has two facilities, including one in Vancouver, Wash., to serve the GE contract. 
Manufacturing the products here doesn't fully immunize the Japanese from the yen's effect because some parts are still made in Japan and shipped to the U.S. for assembly. 

   With its acquisition of RCA, a major consumer electronics player, GE could obtain supplies from its unit. 
For the last two years, RCA has been rapidly automating its huge final-assembly plant in Indianapolis. 
The company makes TV chassis in Mexico, where labor costs are low. 
It makes picture tubes in Pennsylvania and cabinets in North Carolina. 

   GE and Matsushita declined to comment on the number of sets supplied under the existing contract. 

   Separately, in Washington the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that imports of color-television picture tubes from South Korea, Japan, Singapore and Canada may be hurting domestic makers and their workers. 

   The preliminary decisions, made in response to complaints filed by several U.S. trade unions, mean that the Commerce Department and the ITC will continue to investigate charges that the imports have been sold at unfairly low prices in violation of the anti-dumping act. 
If both agencies conclude that the imports are in violation of U.S. trade law, anti-dumping duties may be ordered on them. 

   Officials at the commission said the imports from all four countries totaled about $133 million in the first nine months of last year, up from $120 million during all of 1985. 
South Korea is the largest foreign supplier, followed by Japan, Singapore and Canada.

KABC-AM TALKS A GOOD GAME BEFORE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest round of radio moniker wars, a federal court judge has ruled that 
talk radio is not a generic term and that KABC-AM (790) has a right to use it 
as an identifying slogan while rival talk station KFI-AM (640) does not. 
</P>
<P>
In an order handed down late Friday but not received by the stations' attorneys 
until Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Richard A. Gadbois ruled against talk 
station KFI-AM (640), which had claimed that the term was generic. The judge's 
decision upheld a May ruling that enjoined KFI from using the term talk radio 
in conjunction with its call letters and dial position. 
</P>
<P>
"KABC has offered evidence that listeners in the Los Angeles AM radio market 
primarily associate talk radio with KABC, not with a program format," Gadbois 
wrote. "This evidence is sufficient such that a reasonable fact finder could 
find that talk radio is not a generic term." 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are delighted with the decision," KABC attorney Steven M. Perry said 
Monday. "This concludes the litigation at the trial court level." 
</P>
<P>
KFI attorneys said they probably will appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
KABC filed a trademark infringement suit against KFI in April, saying that it 
had the sole right to use the talk radio label in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, KABC said it adopted its all-talk format in 1960 and, in 1972, 
"invented and adopted the trademark and trade name 'KABC Talk Radio.' " The 
suit said KABC was the only station to use the term for 17 years until KFI 
began using the slogan in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The two stations argued in federal court Sept. 28 before Gadbois.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Amstrad beefs up its top management: Share price rises as
consumer electronics group cuts pre-tax losses to Pounds 20.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the troubled con-sumer electronics group, has rehired the
technological wizard behind many of its earlier successes and is looking for
a new chief executive as it seeks to restore profitability through growth
and acquisition.
The strategy includes closing Amstrad's Spanish subsidiary and measures to
reduce the company's dependence on the professional personal computer
business.
Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's founder and chairman, said that Mr Robert Watkins,
who left Amstrad last year to become group managing director at Binatone,
had returned to manage Dancall Radio, which Amstrad acquired last month.
Mr Watkins, who was Amstrad's technical director, had been credited with
helping to develop many of the company's 'blockbuster' products. Mr Sugar
said: 'Mr Watkins put us in the satellite business and the personal computer
business. His sole responsibility now will be to look after Dancall Radio.'
The Danish cellular radio company is seen as the key to Amstrad's ambitions
in mobile communications.
Mr Malcolm Miller will take charge of the consumer products group, Amstrad's
core business, while the new chief executive will be responsible for finding
and managing acquisitions in areas, such as mobile communications and
satellite systems, which have synergy with electrical and electronic
products.
Amstrad's results for last year showed that the group returned to
profitability before charges. The share price gained 3p yesterday to close
at 48p.
Operating profits were Pounds 15m and the group earned interest income of
Pounds 7.2m. Closure of the Spanish subsidiary, however, meant that Pounds
25m in goodwill was charged, leaving a pre-tax loss of Pounds 20.5m,
compared with Pounds 70.7m.
Turnover for the year to June 30 was Pounds 308.5m, 13.5 per cent down on
the previous year's Pounds 356.5m. The 1992-93 figure included a
contribution of Pounds 12.2m from acquisitions.
Losses per share were 2p, cut from 6.7p; the company is paying a final
dividend of 0.3p making a total of 0.5p.
Mr Sugar said that Amstrad had continued to reduce both inventories and the
lead-time of products, enabling it to increase net cash to Pounds 167m, from
Pounds 162m last year.
Analysts are suggesting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m
for next year. Mr Sugar, who tried unsuccessfully to take the company
private last year at 30p a share, says the core businesses can only generate
profits of Pounds 10m-Pounds 20m a year. Split between 580m shares, he
contends that earnings would be very low without substantial growth.

<HEAD>Most PC's Tested Fail FCC Standards On Radio Interference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The majority of personal computers recently
tested by the Federal Communications Commission failed to meet the
agency's standards on radio interference, according to a published
report on Wednesday.
   Some 75 percent of the personal computers tested failed to meet
the standards, and the consequent interference can disrupt
television sets or cause problems with other home appliances and
equipment, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
   Companies allegedly are using a variety of tactics to evade the
FCC standards, including instances where a firm will modify a
personal computer to pass the tests but will not incorporate the
modification in other machines it manufactures.
   ``Those machines are what we call laboratory queens,'' said
Jerry Freeman, the FCC's national coordinator for
computer-marketing enforcement. ``The manufacturers don't market
exactly what they submitted to us.''
   Some of the more flagrant violations have been committed by
small offshore companies, especially from Asia, said Freeman.
However, others claim that big-name companies have also had
problems with the FCC in recent years.
   ``They've all had problems,'' said Terry Mahn, a Washington,
D.C., attorney who represents companies in proceedings before the
FCC.
   Merle Coe, president of Washington-based Haar Industries Inc.,
said his company recently tested about 150 computers before finding
one that passed FCC standards.
   Haar Industries, which makes software and accessory circuit
boards, found deficiencies in personal computers made by such large
companies as International Business Machines Corp., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
   The FCC attempts to force compliance by levying $2,000 civil
fines, which Mahn labeled an insufficient threat. Mahn said that in
some cases, the agency has successfully forced companies to reform
by threatening to seize and liquidate thousands of computers in
inventory.
   Freeman said the FCC's spot check included computer models that
had originally passed the agency's Class B standard, based on
earlier tests of sample machines supplied by the manufacturers. The
Class B standard regulates emissions of machines sold for use in
the home.
   Those standards are designed to keep various kinds of products
from causing dangerous interference, like disruption of emergency
signals from police or other government agencies. Freeman said
interference could also cause other computers to lose data.
   The problem for personal computer manufacturers has been
obtaining certification. Various components in a computer generate
radio waves, and companies must make exacting tests with their own
equipment or through independent testing laboratories before
submitting a product for review by the FCC.
   The agency reviews the submitted data and makes its own
additional tests before issuing certification. In the fast-moving
PC market, many companies cannot afford to wait that long.
   ``The problem is the offshore guys, plain and simple,'' said Jim
Johnson, president of Amdador Corp., a Minnesota-based testing
laboratory.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has adopted a 
resolution on the division of state property between the state 
and the Republic of Crimea. According to the resolution, state 
property of enterprises in such areas as retail trade, public 
catering, civil, housing, and municipal services, as well as 
property of certain enterprises of [word indistinct] and the 
hotel industry, which are located on the territory of the 
Crimean Republic, will become the property of the Crimean 
Republic. The inventory also includes certain construction 
companies and enterprises of the machine-building, local, food, 
processing, woodworking, and light industries, as well as auto 
transport and [words indistinct]. 
  The resolutions stipulates that ministries and departments 
will submit to the Economy Ministry their proposals regarding an 
inventory of enterprises located on the territory of the Crimean 
Republic, privatization of which, according to the existing 
legislation, should be coordinated with the Ukrainian Cabinet of 
Ministers. 
  According to the resolution, it has been decided that 
enterprises and organizations, the property of which will become 
property of the Crimean Republic, will maintain in 1994 the 
budget relations that existed at the time their property was 
handed over.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In a town where the likes of Thomas Alva Edison
and Guglielmo Marconi once worked, a town that helped perfect the
radio and was home to New York's first regularly licensed radio
station, the message is the medium. Just ask members of the Antique
Radio Club in Schenectady, N.Y., one of about 30 such groups around
the world.

<TEXT>
   The members of the Antique Radio Club
aren't very impressed with a fancy computer during ``Show and
Tell,'' even if the palm-sized gadget does decipher Morse code at
the speed of light.
   But when someone starts passing around a set of stained,
yellowed photographs from 1915 depicting one of Schenectady's first
amateur radio stations, a buzz of animated conversation fills the
cramped basement where they are meeting.
   This is, after all, something the 15 radio buffs, most
considerably advanced in age, can understand. Tenderly thumbing the
pictures, Carmin Baker wrinkles his brow and smiles.
   ``Back then, it was kind of a prestige thing to know, hey, the
guy next door is a radio ham,'' Baker says. ``We used to try to
hang around him because we were interested in that kind of stuff.''
   The other silver-haired radio aficionados nod their heads.
They've obviously come here to ``get together with the other guys
and see what they got and talk,'' as one member says.
   The Schenectady club, affiliated with the Rochester-based
Antique Wireless Association, is one of about 30 scattered around
the world, according to Bruce Kelley, the curator of the
association's museum. All together, there are about 10,000 antique
or historical radio collectors, mostly in New York state, and of
those 300 are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to
transmit on the rare radios, Kelley says.
   However, there's something about the Schenectady organization
that suggests it's kind of special.
   ``I built Langmuir's personal hi-fi set for him,'' blurts out
Robert Thayer, 73, referring to the Nobel Prize-winning chemist
Irving Langmuir. ``I put round knobs on the thing and he went
crazy. He couldn't have a round knob. He wanted a pointer on there
and he wanted to know where every one of the things was set. He
didn't care how loud it was, but he wanted to know where that
pointer was!''
   The memories come rushing back to these proud veterans of an era
half a century ago when Schenectady, then home to the General
Electric and American Locomotive companies, unabashedly called
itself ``the city that hauls and lights the world.''
   They talk excitedly about an ``intellectualism'' that once
permeated the ``Electric City,'' located on the banks of the Mohawk
River 15 miles northwest of Albany. Thomas Alva Edison started it
all when he established his machine works in 1886, they say. Six
years later, the two nondescript brick buildings would become GE.
   Besides jobs and prosperity, GE infused a much-needed dose of
self-respect into a town that had too often been the butt of cruel
jokes. The thankfully forgotten song, ``I Can't Spell
Schenectady,'' didn't seem fair to a thriving metropolis that had a
lively downtown, huge department stores and a citizenry that
included scientists such as Guglielmo Marconi.
   ``Schenectady was a nice place to live back in the '20s. One of
the nicest cities in the country,'' boasted club chairman Fay
Eckert. ``Well, they had the Erie Canal here for one thing, up to a
point, anyway, which made it interesting. And it was such a clean
city.''
   But all this was before GE pulled out of the radio production
business after World War II, quickly reducing its work force in
Schenectady from a wartime high of 45,000 to 12,000. Many of the
folks swapping memories at this reunion were among those thousands
laid off.
   Twenty years later, the locomotive company folded, giving a coup
de grace to what had been a long downward spiral.
   ``Now, nobody comes to Schenectady anymore,'' grumbles Francis
Emrich, a private radio operator for 42 years.
   Baker's insistent voice rises above the din: ``When I was a
young man, everybody got out of college, went down to GE and got a
job in the testing department.''
   That's why he, like most of the others, started working for GE
in 1940, earning 35 cents an hour on an assembly line.
   This was a time when Schenectady breathed, ate and drank radio
technology, Emrich remembers. The city's skyline bristled with the
antennae of ``hm'' radio operators. As a matter of fact, Emrich
says, GE used to give away tubes and other paraphernalia to hams,
until unscrupulous individuals began to steal the stuff.
   Emrich's a purist, which means he won't use anything but genuine
parts in his antique radio transmitters. So, many times, he's had
to search in some pretty odd places for spare parts.
   It seems natural to these people that New York's first regularly
licensed radio station, WGY, which first broadcast in February
1922, was started by GE in Schenectady. Television, also largely
developed by GE, soon followed in 1939. If necessity was the mother
of invention, then GE was the doctor who performed the delivery.
   ``One thing about GE, their minds were always working down there
to improve things,'' Emrich says.
   Jack Nelson, considered the club's patriarch because he reported
to work for GE back in 1928, stands up to announce that the widow
of a former friend and club supporter is having a garage sale. Lots
of old radio equipment will be available.
   The old radios the members avidly collect and lovingly restore
are becoming scarce, such as the 1924 Westinghouse Nelson keeps in
his cluttered cellar. Or the 1930s Atwater Kent that a beaming Ed
Farrell showed off in the back of his van at the club's flea market
before the meeting.
   ``The thing is, when we were kids, a kid that was just mildly
interested in radio could take a crystal and a pair of earphones
and some wire and make it work,'' says Thayer, his fingers wrapped
around an odd-looking 1936 GE metal tube that he uses as a gavel.
``Now, everything is so terrifically complicated that a kid has to
be terrifically interested to get into it. He can't just start with
a simple thing and work up.''
   Radios, especially antique ones, are fetching high prices also,
so much so that Eckert now calls collecting ``a rich man's hobby.''
   He leaps at the chance to give an example: A 25-tube Zenith
Stratosphere from 1939, a luxury radio that stands 5-feet tall and
probably cost $900 then, was recently auctioned for $8,000 in
Georgia.
   Eckert's own 33-tube E.H. Scott radio from 1940-41, which he
calls the ``Rolls Royce'' of radios, fetched a price of $350 back
then and now is worth about $750.
   ``But,'' he admits, ``it's not in mint condition.''

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea on Thursday 
denied as an "invented story" the recent report that more than 
100 North Korean loggers in Siberia were wishing to come to 
South Korea. According to the NAEWOE press, a radio Pyongyang 
broadcast said it is just unthinkable that North Korean people 
try to defect to South Korea. 
  "Our people remain convinced that away from the bosom of the 
Republic, they cannot live even a moment and there is no 
rewarding future for themselves and their descendants," it said. 
The broadcast said this was clearly evidenced by the case of Yi 
In-mo and two people's constabulary unit soldiers who, after 
being rescued by South Korea in the sea, chose to return to the 
North last month. Yi In-mo was a self-styled North Korean war 
correspondent caught in the South during the Korean war as a 
guerrilla fighter, who was sent back to the North last year on 
humanitarian grounds after refusing to change allegiance. The 
radio said that the report about the loggers is a "wild rumor" 
invented by South Korean authorities in their attempt to 
"placate South Korean people's anti-government struggles and 
distract public attention." 
  A Seoul government official said over the weekend that 
hundreds of North Korean loggers escaped from Pyongyang-run 
logging yards in Siberia and more than 100 of them came in 
contact with South Korean missions in Russia for permission to 
come to South Korea. About 16,000 to 20,000 North Koreans are 
known to work at Siberian logging yards under harsh conditions.

<F P=106> [Comment by Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of Russian </F>
State Television and Radio Company, under general headline: 
"Tales from the Vienna Woods" -- last paragraph is editorial 
postscript] 
  [Text] We asked Anatoliy Lysenko, general director of the 
Russian State Television and Radio Company, to comment on the 
situation which has taken shape: 
  Last week the Ministry of Finance drew up another draft 
state 
budget. I do not know how good or bad it is in other spheres, 
but as regards the state television and radio companies.... 
Under this draft, which has not yet been approved by the 
government, it is proposed to allocate for the funding of the 
television and radio company, on average, approximately 
one-fourth of the amount that we need for a minimum normal 
existence. This means that Russian radio, for example, will be 
broadcasting for something like five hours a day, and Russian 
television even less -- four hours and 20 minutes. So we will 
have to distribute our air time roughly as follows: from 0730 
through 0900 hours for those who are already awake. From 1600 
through 1730 for children, so that they do not forget that the 
television has been invented. In the evening it will be 
possible to put out "Vesti," followed by a 10- or 15-minute 
program with a topical account of the government's concern for 
its people. 
  I certainly do not think that the quality of all our 
programs 
is on a high level. And yet an important question occurs to me 
with regard to this draft budget: What does the Finance 
Ministry expect those people who are accustomed to sitting on 
the sofa in front of the television after work in the evening to 
do with themselves if the television set is showing nothing? We 
could think up a lot of answer to this question, but none of 
them in society's favor. This is not to mention the fact that 
we will have to dismiss three-fourths of our employees without a 
leaving gratuity.... As is known, we were born to turn a 
fairytale into a true story. Sometimes it is a very frightening 
fairytale. Although I am a great fan of science fiction, I find 
it hard to believe that, before approving the draft, the 
government will review the question of television funding. But 
there is still a glimmer of hope. 
  [Postcript] While this issue was being made up, the problem 
of funding state television and radio companies has developed 
further. The president has met with the heads of "Ostankino" 
and the Russian State Television and Radio Company and promised 
them support, saying that there must definitely be state 
television in Russia. "Although the budget will be cut just the 
same," Anatoliy Lysenko declared after meeting with the 
president. "The question is: by how much? But the government 
must decide this."

   Delta Air Lines insists it can take a joke as well as anybody. 
But some radio executives aren't so sure. 

   After the airline's recent spate of publicized incidents, many radio morning shows began lampooning the episodes. 
WHTZ-FM in New York came out with its own version of the song "Delta Dawn." (The opening refrain: Delter why can't your pilots learn to fly?/Near misses do not make for friendly skies.) 
In Philadelphia, WSNI-FM played a mock recording of a conversation in an airline cockpit. 

   "We had this pilot carrying on with a stewardess when a jet goes whizzing by," says Don Cannon, host of the station's morning show. 
"It was supposed to be funny." 

   Shortly afterward, the stations say, Delta's advertising broker yanked the airline's commercials from both stations. 
The broker also sent a letter to more than 20 other stations threatening similar action. 
While confirming the letter, Delta says it was unauthorized. 
The carrier also says that it cancelled some commercials only to lower its profile. 

   "We were waiting for some of the storm to die down," a Delta spokesman says. 
"It's not like we don't have a sense of humor." 

   Crazy Numbers
   Here's a piece of investment advice: Don't ignore the typographical errors. 

   A recent profile of securities analyst Thornton L. O'glove on this page noted that the maverick analyst had beaten mainstream securities analysts in steering investors away from Crazy Eddie Inc., an electronics retail chain whose financial results have deteriorated this year. 

   In the case of Crazy Eddie, Mr. O'glove said he noted, among other things, that for the quarter ended Aug. 31, 1986, sales from stores open a year or more were up only 5% from the same period in 1985; by contrast, sales in the 1985 period had jumped 20% from 1984. 
Mr. O'glove was disturbed by the 5% figure -- and told his clients about it. 

   Well, it seems that the 5% figure was a typographical error by Crazy Eddie in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing; the correct figure, according to a Crazy Eddie spokesman, was 15%. 

   But don't worry: Mr. O'glove says he also noticed that inventories were out of control as well. 
"I would have written (the negative report) on inventories alone," he says. 

   Hello, Honda?
   Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald E. Petersen recently had cause to wonder whether one of his company's better ideas is really so good after all. 

   Mr. Petersen was in Traverse City, Mich., to give a speech to the National Governor's Conference, and the conference organizers sent a Lincoln Town car around to the airport to pick him up. 

   But as Mr. Petersen climbed in, the car conked out. 

   Mr. Petersen got to deliver his speech -- on the need to restore American competitiveness. 
His aides, meanwhile, got the task of figuring out why Mr. Petersen's top-of-the-line product failed to perform. 

   The failure was the fault of a baggage handler who was pitching Mr. Petersen's luggage into the car's trunk, says Ford vice president for public relations David Scott. 
Somehow, he says, the baggage loader managed to trip an optional fuel cut-off switch tucked up inside the trunk. 
The switch is designed to prevent gasoline spills after a collision. 

   "The guy threw the bag in, and the car went off," says Mr. Scott. 
"I've never heard of it happening before." 

   Fortunately for Mr. Petersen, there was another Ford at the airport, which is why the chairman arrived at the governor's conference in an Aerostar van. 

   Odds &amp; Ends
   Donald Shackelford, chairman of State Savings Bank in Columbus, Ohio, says the federal savings and loan examiners that were "loaned" to Texas last year to help uncover excesses in Texas have returned to Ohio.

<F P=106> [Article by Lt. Gen. Valentyn Samoylenko, chief of </F>
communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: "In Full Swing. 
The Signal Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine at Work"] 
  [Text] Military communications evolved in the remote past, 
when the unique features of East Slavic military art began to 
emerge. At that time, troops in the battlefield were led by 
voice commands, the personal example of their commanders, and 
signals sent by audible devices. That is how commanders passed 
on orders and instructions and received reports. 
  However, these simple means of communication could be used 
to 
exercise command over troops only as long as military actions 
took place on small areas of land, usually on open ground, and 
commanders personally observed the battlefield. 
  Fundamentally new means of communication came into use in 
the 
wars fought in the second half of the 19th century and the 
beginning of the 20th century -- the telegraph and the 
telephone, the invention of which was made possible by the 
important contributions of such leading scientists and inventors 
as T.L. Shylling, V.S. Yakobi, V.B. Yakobi, P.M. Holubytskyy, 
Ye.I. Hvozdyov, A.A. Stolpovskyy, and others. 
  On 25 April (7 May) 1895, an important event took place in 
the history of mankind. On this day, A.S. Popov, in a paper 
delivered at the session of the Physical Division of the Russian 
Physico-Chemical Society, reported the discovery of a new means 
of communicating -- radio. The device he created made it 
possible to transmit electrical oscillations (signals) without 
wires. This was a truly great discovery. 
  From this moment on, scientists in many countries began 
working intensively on the practical application of this 
wonderful phenomenon. 
  Radio technology [radiometody], which involves the 
generation 
and propagation of radio waves, also forms the basis of 
radio-relay, tropospheric, and space communication lines, radio 
broadcasting, television, radiometry, phototelegraphy, and many 
other fields. 
  Radio communication uses wave frequencies that range from 
hundreds of hertz to tens and more gigahertz (GHz). Very low 
frequency [VLF], low frequency [LF], high frequency [HF], and 
ultrahigh frequency [UHF] radio communication lines enable 
control in all fields of human endeavor. Radio performs 
miracles. Radio waves are reflected from meteor trails, and they 
penetrate the thickness of the ocean's waves; they are used 
underground and in space; they bring us information about other 
bodies in the universe. 
  Radio communication plays a particularly important role in 
the Armed Forces. Clearly, no modern war can be won without 
reliable, uninterrupted communications. To lose the ability to 
communicate means to lose the ability to control your forces, 
and the loss of the ability to exercise command over forces 
inevitably results in defeat. This fundamental principle, 
established during the years of the Great Patriotic War, remains 
equally important today. 
  Radio makes it possible to exercise command over troops and 
weapons at any time of the year and at any time of day or night, 
requiring no search and no superstructure [bez poshuku and bez 
nadbudovy], when stationed in one place and when on the move, 
over the heads of the enemy. 
  Modern military radio equipment makes it possible to block 
the interception of information and sometimes even to prevent 
the discovery that radio waves are being used. 
  This radio equipment has made it possible to create 
fundamentally new organizational structures of mobile signal 
centers at various echelons of command. These structures are 
easily operated, mobile, and provide commanders and staffs with 
means of communication both in place and on the move [na mistsi 
i v rusi]. 
  The role of technical training of military personnel -- of 
every soldier and every commander -- has grown immeasurably in 
modern times. The range of skills that a member of the signal 
troops [voyin-svyazkivets] has to master has expanded 
significantly. Thus an officer must have the knowledge and 
skills of a well-trained service engineer. Sergeants and 
privates can also be trained to perform the tasks of technicians 
or mechanics. This has established the requirements in the 
training of signal troops. The majority of graduates of military 
signals schools, training units, and subunits are true masters 
in their field, capable of operating complex modern equipment. 
  In the experienced hands of military signals personnel, the 
means of communication make it possible for the command 
[komanduvannya] to exercise uninterrupted and timely control of 
forces and weapons. And the signal troops of the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine have experienced hands. 
  The Signal Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine work 
diligently and painstakingly to hone their professional skills. 
During the winter academic term, a series of complex training 
exercises involving the radio communications system were carried 
out by the Signal Troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The 
results of the exercises revealed excellent skills in operating 
complex radio communications equipment by signals specialists 
and the ability of officers to command subordinate subunits in 
providing support in the control and command of troops. 
  The collectives commanded by officers V. Mystyuk, I. 
Royenko, 
V. Shevchyk, A. Yemets, and S. Maslov perform with special 
distinction. The discipline, assiduity, and excellent knowledge 
of regulation equipment [vyvirena tekhnika] exhibitied by the 
personnel of these units and subunits allows them to perform 
their assigned tasks quickly and with a high degree of 
efficiency. 
  Officers V. Sanarov, S. Butuzov, V. Tabak, A. Levchenko, V. 
Lysakonov, S. Dmytriyenko, and F. Kulishenko have shown 
themselves to be excellent specialists and good methodists 
[metodysty]. 
  Many good things can be said about the crews [ekipazhi] led 
by warrant officers Yu. Semenov, V. Rybachuk, S. Pyenkin, V. 
Bryshchatyy, P. Bondar, V. Mandalyna, V. Dehtyarov, and S. 
Litvynenko. Even in peacetime, the signals personnel continue to 
perform their professional duties in the ranks of the UN 
peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia. M. Metla, V. 
Kichkar, V. Kulykov, S. Kyrpychnyy, and L. Zolotoholovyy perform 
their duties with distinction. 
  Watch duty [boyove cherhuvannya] is part of performing a 
battle mission [boyove zavdannya]. The high degree of 
responsibility and conscientiousness exhibited by A. Volva, M. 
Chechko, M. Hrytsyuta, S. Derkach, V. Bilenkyy, Yu. Prokhorov, 
I. Kulyk, Yu. Mostovyy, and V. Oliynyk have won them the respect 
of their commanders and peers. 
  Much praise is merited by female military personnel and 
employees [viyskosluzhbovtsi i sluzhbovtsi] of the Armed Forces 
who serve as radio operators, telegraph operators, and telephone 
operators [radysty, telehrafisty, telefonisty]. In particular, 
employees [sluzhbovtsi] of the Armed Forces M. Kornet and L. 
Matveyeva. 
  The annual reinforcement of the officer corps of the Signal 
Troops with graduates of the Kiev Institute of Control and 
Command and Signals [instytut upravlinnya i zvyazku] and the 
Poltava Higher Military Command Signals School [vyshche viyskove 
komandne uchylyshche zvyazku] also contributes to the excellent 
performance of tasks designed to guarantee communications. A 
great deal of effort and energy is devoted to the training of 
future officers by instructors V. Starkov, V. Dudolad, and V. 
Tymoshynskyy. 
  On the eve of the Great Victory Day over fascism, I would 
like to wish veterans and young soldiers, experienced and novice 
signals personnel good health, personal happiness, and continued 
success in the building of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 
ensuring these forces with a high degree of combat readiness.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1000 GMT on 26 May broadcasts a 4.5-minute report that radio 
and television companies across Russia are going to set up a 
league as a measure against the law on mass media which is about 
to be adopted by the State Duma. The announcer says that the 
proposed law stipulates the creation of the state Duma's 
exclusive TV and radio service, which, the announcer says, will 
be financed from the federal budget, thus reducing the amount of 
financial support presently allocated to other state media. 
  Anatoliy Batyushkin, head of the department of radio and 
television at the Ministry of Communications, is asked by a 
Radio Rossii correspondent about the present financial situation 
in the broadcasting industry. He says: 
  "At present we owe the power engineers about 50 billion 
rubles [R] for the electrical energy already supplied to TV 
centers. The TV and radio broadcasting companies' debt for the 
first quarter stands at R192 billion. Until now only R100 
billion have been repaid. Only R25 billion has been used to pay 
salaries, buy spare parts, etc, while in fact, the power 
engineers need at least R50 billion for the first quarter year." 
  Asked whether broadcasting will go back to normal in the 
near 
future, Batyushkin says: 
  "I think that we will be able to work well if the federal 
television and radio broadcasting service does in fact achieve 
stable financing. If we are paid, no conflict situation, 
nothing will interfere with nonstop broadcasting, just as it 
used to be when we had a system when a single minute of unused 
time at some or other transmitter was considered to be an 
emergency situation." 
  In response to that comment, Radio Rossii correspondent 
Aleksandr Kurekov says: 
  "First of all, a few words from a note on technical 
stoppages 
of transmitters broadcasting Radio Rossii programs. From 24 
May, because of lack of energy supplies, transmitters in Taldym, 
near Moscow, Blagoveshchensk in Amur oblast, and in Chita are 
inoperative. These transmitters used to provide one of the most 
stable feeds of radio programs on longwave." Kurekov adds that 
people in these areas can no longer hear the 650 or so reports 
from localities provided by Radio Rossii's correspondents, or 
the 200-300 reports filed by them from near-abroad and other 
countries. He also said that Kaluga, Smolensk, Tver, and 
Voronezh oblasts have been left without Radio Rossii's programs 
as well.

STARTING this week, the World Service is to run, over the next two months, a
Spotlight on South Asia, about the Indian sub-continent and its neighbours.
In four programmes on successive Mondays, John Renner will examine affairs
in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. This week's, Division and Identity,
begins with a recording of Nehru's promise that the Indians will 'redeem our
pledge' - a promise at once torpedoed by the Hindu-Moslem division that gave
birth to Pakistan, and subsequently Bangladesh.
Situations in these three nations are sharply scrutinised, with telling
interventions from local voices. Next week Renner will consider social
matters, and the week after, the 'huddled masses' in the regions of great
poverty, with a view of the causes and the conceivable cures.
There will be features and plays from the same countries too, including  -
on St. Valentine's Day] - a Sanskrit tragi-comedy, Hayavadana, where rivals
for the same woman each cut their own heads off. The goddess Kali puts them
back, but unhappily she gets the heads on the wrong shoulders . . .
The Imperial thread was tugged again on Friday in Radio 3's A Future for
Their Past. Christopher Hope, a native South African, presented other South
African writers, black and white, on the future of South African writing
after the end of apartheid. What shall we have to write about seemed to be
the principal question, and the main answer was the past. Lately, stories of
repression and resistance, said JM Coetzee, had seemed more important than
inventive fiction. Free from censorship, the South Africans had to learn
about themselves - especially the blacks, whose history was mainly recalled
from their conflicts with the invaders. Next week Radio 3 will give five
South African Snapshots, to include work by some of the contributors to this
programme.
Radio 3's Sunday play this week was a subtle piece by David Pownall, Dreams
and Censorship, that contrived to include in its dramatis personae St. John
the Divine, King James I and William Shakespeare. The King (Hugh Ross) is
anxious that the new English Bible shall not include the Book of Revelation
lest it encourage revolt. Shakespeare (Edward Petherbridge), whom the King
calls Willy, is directing a company in the events that took place on Patmos,
where St. John (Robert Stephens) has retired, and where the Romans are to
crucify two vestal virgins, one of them played by randy young Prince Charles
(Gary King).
The arguments that connect these events are as entertaining as they are
interesting, even if sometimes as historically dodgy as (say) Henry V; they
lead properly to the inclusion of Revelation in the King James Bible that we
know. The playing throughout is first-class under Eoin O'Callaghan's
direction.
Good Wives (Radio 4 FM, Thursday) is the sequel to Alcott's Little Women,
which has been dramatised in six parts by Marcie Kahan. We begin with Meg's
wedding to John Brooke, and go on to Amy's disappointing day out with the
young ladies of her drawing class, that only one of the invited dozen
attends. If you enjoyed Little Women you will enjoy this, for the girls seem
hardly to have grown up at all. Marilyn Imrie directs, and Marmee is no less
than Gayle Hunnicutt.
The Saturday play on Radio 4 was David Halliwell's Crossed Lines, that began
with a chap being offered Pounds 88,000 by a strange woman on the telephone,
and went on as improbably for 90 minutes. The lucky guy was Ian Hogg and the
director Philip Martin.
Richard Imison, one of the best influences on radio drama, died from cancer
last week. He had been the BBC's script editor for almost 30 years, later
its deputy director of drama.

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., which got its
start with a break-through automatic rice cooker, is looking to
bolster its consumer electronics business while moving into
higher-profit industrial areas, analysts say.
   The company's products could stock an entire appliance store and
then some: radios, tape recorders, refrigerators, air conditioners,
video-cassette recorders and more.
   Some of its most widely recognized brands are Panasonic,
Technics and Quasar.
   Matsushita Electric confirmed it is negotiating to buy
entertainment giant MCA, which has a vast library of movies and
television programs, in a deal valued at around $7 billion.
   With its 163 consolidated subsidiaries, Matsushita Electric
forms Japan's third largest corporation and commands the largest
share of Japan's home electronics market. A Morgan Stanley survey
in June ranked Matsushita the 25th-largest publicly-held
corporation in the world.
   It is also known to insiders as the ``Matsushita bank,''
reporting holdings of over $10 billion in cash assets alone last
year. Total sales topped $41.6 billion.
   The influence of legendary founder Konosuke Matsushita is felt
in virtually every Japanese home where an automatic rice cooker
takes the drudgery out of preparing the nation's staple food.
   Matsushita, a man who never went to high school yet became
Japan's most famous entrepreneur, popularized the electric rice
cooker in the 1950s in keeping with his corporate philosophy: ``To
manufacture items of good quality for daily use in abundant supply,
thereby enriching and improving life for everyone.''
   That comment in 1932 came a little less than 15 years after the
23-year-old Matsushita left his employer to capitalize on his own
electrical switch invention. Today, the Matsushita empire has
spawned nearly 500 related firms operating in 36 countries.
   During the 37 years it has operated in the United States,
Matsushita has built 12 factories, established seven sales
companies and a research facility and employs some 10,000 people.
   But the company is now facing a crossroads. Over 60 percent of
its sales have been concentrated in low-growth consumer products
such as refrigerators and video-cassette recorders. Compared to
other Japanese electronics makers, it is having difficulty making
the jump to more profitable industrial sectors, analysts say.
   It has also been unable to come up with a new hit product to
take the place of the wildly successful VCR, reflecting the
company's strength in manufacturing capability over inventive
prowess.
   Boris Petersik, an analyst for Barclay de Zoete Wedd Securities
Ltd., notes that Matsushita's mere size - including its 25,000
affiliated retailers in Japan - has proved a burden to shifting its
resources.
   The group plans to change, however. It developed a long-term
plan six years ago to focus on seven areas of high technology
including computers, semiconducters and communication technology.
   By 1992, the company hopes those areas will account for 40
percent of total sales.
   This year, the company has been investing huge amounts - some
400 billion Japanese yen ($3.2 billion) - in crystal displays,
computers and semiconductors. It is also trying to develop
profitable movie and television cameras for professional use,
Petersik said.
   But Matsushita has had a hard time cracking Sony's dominance on
the professional market as well as its lead in the consumer market
for VCRs. Sony now has the rich video software resources it
purchased last year in its $5 billion acquisition of Columbia
Pictures Entertainment, he said.
   ``They don't want to lose completely on consumer products,'' he
said. The MCA acquisition, if it goes through, would both give the
company access to software to keep its consumer-products sales
healthy and to studios where it could introduce its professional
products.
   ``Software is going to be the critical factor'' in the video
market, Martin Beresford, senior analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities Ltd., said of the Japanese company's possible MCA
purchase.
   A company spokesman in Tokyo said MCA is only one of the
companies with which Matsushita is involved in talks, but said
nothing had been decided. He said he could not comment further.
   The acquisition also would indicate that the company is
recovering from the death last year of the 94-year-old company
founder, according to Petersik.
   Revered as a visionary of Japanese business, Matsushita was also
one of Japan's richest men, leaving an estate valued $1.7 billion.
   And he was among Japan's most generous individuals. In a country
where charitable contributions do not qualify for tax breaks, he
established his own non-profit foundation, opened his factories to
the handicapped and endowed cultural institutions and a private
school for training future leaders.
