   Frontrunners in the 1,168-mile
Anchorage-to-Nome sled dog race edged closer to the halfway point
today after a musher who placed ninth last year took the lead.
   Dee Dee Jonrowe was the first to reach the checkpoint at Takotna,
arriving at 6:53 p.m. Wednesday, less than 2{ hours after she left
McGrath. Defending champion Susan Butcher held the No. 2 spot,
leaving McGrath at 5:16 p.m., 48 minutes after Jonrowe.
   Standings Wednesday night in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race
showed Joe Runyan, Rick Swenson and Martin Buser in the lineup
immediately behind Jonrowe and Butcher. The rest of the top 10
consisted of Joe Garnie, Jerry Riley, Jacques Philip, Lavon Barve
and Tim Osmar. Nine of the 10 are Alaskans. Philip is from France.
   Takotna is 128 miles from Iditarod, the halfway point. The first
musher at Iditarod is to receive a silver trophy and $3,000 in
silver ingots. The race carries a $250,000 purse, with the winner at
Nome qualifying for $50,000.
   Jonrowe is running in her seventh Iditarod and Butcher is
shooting for a fourth consecutive win. The two women are friends,
and Jonrowe has purchased dogs from Butcher's kennel in Manley.
   Standings Wednesday night showed 15 of the Iditarod's 45 mushers
either were in McGrath or just beyond the Kuskokwim River town. Most
of the others had reported in at Nikolai, the checkpoint 48 miles
east of McGrath.
   Iditarod founder Joe Redington held 12th place in the evening
standings.
   Forty-nine mushers left the starting line Saturday in Anchorage.
Four have dropped out.

   Lavon Barve was first out of this Yukon
River checkpoint Sunday, taking the lead in the Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race away from three-time winner Susan Butcher and heading
overland to Norton Sound.
   Barve of Wasilla left Kaltag at 2:28 p.m. even though Butcher
had beaten him to the checkpoint by almost an hour in the latest
stage of the 1,158-mile marathon race from Anchorage to Nome.
   The two leaders were followed into Kaltag by four-time Iditarod
winner Rick Swenson at 1:26 p.m. and 1989 champion Joe Runyan at
1:33 p.m. Dee Dee Jonrowe and Tim Osmar of were next in just before
2:30 p.m.
   Robin Jaconson of arrived at 4:15 p.m..
   By late afternoon, Barve was the only musher to have left
Kaltag. Swenson said he would take an eight hour rest here.
   Butcher, who started the race with 17 dogs, had 12 Sunday. Race
officials said some were dropped at checkpoints along the trail due
to illness.
   When she became the first musher to reach Ruby Saturday, Butcher
was rewarded with a luxurious meal of shrimp, veal, chocolate
cheesecake and other delights, as well as $2,500. She said then
that she intended to maintain the lead all the way to Nome.
   Kaltag is 42 miles along the Yukon, the biggest river in Alaska,
from the last checkpoint at Nulato, which Butcher left earlier
Sunday as leader. From Kaltag, where it heads overland to Unakleet
on Norton Sound. With 850 people, Unakleet is the bigest community
on the trail outside of Nome and Anchorage.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along one branch of the
trail, the Iditarod race was started in 1973 to commemorate the
1925 emergency delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from
Anchorage to Nome by relay dog sled teams.
   Joe Redington, the 73-year-old man considered the father of the
Iditarod, was last reported in 32nd place after pulling out of
Cripple, 510 miles from the starting line.

   Three-time champion Susan Butcher led the
mushers as the leaders of the 1,168-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race began the sprint to Alaska's west coast.
   Butcher left this Yukon River village at 6:55 p.m. Sunday, with
Martin Buser of Big Lake one minute behind her.
   Joe Runyan of Nenana was third, departing at 7:45 p.m. Then came
Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow, logging out at 9:13 p.m., four-time
champion Rick Swenson of Manley, 9:14 p.m., and Lavon Barve of
Wasilla, 10:19 p.m.
   Butcher, Buser, Runyan, Jonroe and Swenson have generally been
out front of the pack, trading the lead among themselves, since they
left the gold mining ghost town of Iditarod, 558 miles into the race.
   ``We've seen some head games, some traveling together and some
moving alone, but the competition is definitely very intense,'' said
Butcher, who won the nation's leading sled dog race in 1986, 1987
and 1988.
   Swenson, a four-time winner, said the top five ``have
accomplished one of our goals by separating ourselves from the rest
of the pack.''
   The race, inspired by a sled dog relay that brought serum from
Anchorage to Nome during a diptheria outbreak in 1925, was begun in
1973.
   The mushers raced toward the coastal village of Unalakleet, 93
miles away and the longest stretch between checkpoints in the race.
When they left Kaltag, they were 357 miles from the finish line in
Nome.
   The winner receives $50,000; the next 19 finishers share $200,000.
   Forty-one mushers remain in the contest. Eight have dropped out
since the race started March 3 in Anchorage.

   Susan Butcher left the competition behind on
the icy Bering Sea Coast and mushed through bone-chilling winds
Wednesday to claim her third straight victory in the 1,150-mile
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher, 33, collected a $30,000 first prize by urging her
nine-dog team into the finish chute at 8:42 p.m., hours ahead of
her closest rival in the 16th annual Anchorage-to-Nome trek. She
had been on the trail for more than 11 days.
   ``I'm just amazed at what my dogs are doing, and what they've
done all year,'' said Butcher.
   Butcher said she would try next year for a fourth straight win.
``I very much want four, I guess I want five,'' she said.
   Hundreds of cheering fans braved the blustery 15-degree weather
to watch as Butcher became the first musher to win three
consecutive Iditarods. Butcher started the race with 17 dogs, but
dropped eight at checkpoints along the trail.
   ``I'm really happy,'' said Butcher's husband, Dave Monson, who
earlier this month won another long-distance Alaska sled dog race,
the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest. The couple run a kennel in the interior
Alaska village of Manley.
   ``We've had a tremendous year,'' Monson said. ``It shows that
hard work pays off sometimes.''
   Butcher's closest competitor, Martin Buser of Big Lake, was
trailing by at least 14 hours Wednesday. Butcher's longtime rival,
four-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, was minutes
behind Buser for third place.
   Joe Garnie of Teller was running fourth, and 70-year-old Joe
Redington of Knik, who organized the first Iditarod in 1973 but has
never won the race, was fifth.
   Butcher had slept little since Monday, when she reached the
Bering Sea coast in Unalakleet, 229 miles from Nome. She said a
training run last month along the windy coast accustomed her team
to the punishing conditions.
   Tuesday night, Butcher guided her team through subzero
temperatures and winds that brought the wind chill factor down to
minus 70 degrees. Peeking out from a fur-ruffed parka, Butcher
suffered only a frost-nipped wrist.
   ``The wind was going right into my big mitt and up my arm. It's
still pretty sore,'' she said earlier Wednesday.
   One of Butcher's lead dogs this year was Granite, a husky that
led her to victory last year.
   Butcher, competing in her 11th Iditarod, long dreamed of being
the first woman musher to win, but that honor went to Libby Riddles
of Teller in 1985. Butcher won in 1986 and 1987, setting course
records each time.
   Last year, when the race followed its shorter southern route,
Butcher finished in 11 days, 2 hours.
   The Iditarod, named after an old supply route to the gold mining
districts of interior Alaska, draws its inspiration from a 1925
relay of diphtheria serum to Nome, which was hit hard by an
outbreak of the disease.
   The race started March 5 on trucked-in snow. The temperature in
downtown Anchorage hovered around 32 degrees and climbed even
higher during the next few days, which strained the cold-loving
huskies.
   Fresh snow slowed the leaders as they climbed into the Alaska
Range. That gave an advantage to Redington, who had taken his
mandatory 24-hour layover early in the race and sailed past the
leaders on the trail they had packed down.
   Redington, known as the Father of the Iditarod, has entered all
but two of the race's 16 runnings and has placed as high as fifth.
For 400 miles, it seemed as if he might finally win, but he lost
the lead to Buser on the Yukon River.
   Butcher quickly caught up, passing Buser on Tuesday near Koyuk,
171 miles from the finish.
   Five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out.

   Musher Susan Butcher crossed the finish line
today to claim her fourth victory in the last five years in the
1,158-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Her victory, in record time, turned the tables on defending
champion Joe Runyan, who edged her last year at the finish of the
Anchorage-to-Nome race. Runyan trailed Butcher on the trail by more
than an hour.
   ``She just had a better plan,'' said Libby Riddles, the first
woman to win the race in 1985, watching the finish on the sunny
streets of this Gold Rush-era town. ``She outraced these guys. She
maintained her dog team better.
   ``It's an incredible unbelievable high,'' Riddles said. ``You go
thorugh all those ups and downs on the way to Nome. You can't
believe you've done it till you get there.''
   Smiling as she ran beside her dogs in her bright red snowsuit,
the 33-year-old Butcher finished the race shortly before 11 a.m.
Her official time was 11 days, 1 hour, 53 minutes, 23 seconds,
beating both her record for the route taken this year and her
overall record for all Iditarod races.
   Earlier, following a mandatory six-hour rest, Butcher left the
White Mountain checkpoint 77 miles from the finish one hour 20
minutes ahead of Runyan.
   She stopped for only three minutes at Safety to move a few dogs
to different positiions in the harness before striking out on the
last 22-mile leg of the race at 8:36 a.m. AST.
   ``It's Runyan who I have to worry about,'' Butcher said while
still on the trail. ``He has a hot team, but he's got to get ahead
of me.''
   Butcher had dropped another dog at Elim, leaving her with 11
dogs to Runyan's 15 over the last 123 miles of the race.
   Butcher's time handily broke the speed record for the identical
route in 1986 _ 11 days, 15 hours and six minutes. Her 1987
Iditarod record of 11 days 2 hours 5 minutes was set on an
alternate route.
   Anticipating today's finish, Iditarod organizers spent Tuesday
hanging traditional trail's end banners and setting up the racers'
chute on Front Street in Nome.
   Lavon Barve reached White Mountain in third place.
   Four-time winner Rick Swenson was reported out of the checkpoint
at Elim, while Tim Osmar, Robin Jacobson and DeeDee Jonrowe were at
the checkpoint 123 miles from the finish.
   The leaders have switched to lightweight sprint sleds, instead
of the heavier long-distance sleds they began the race with at
Anchorage on March 3.
   First prize is $50,000, with the rest of the $200,000 purse
divided among the next 19 finishers.
   Teams bucked a stiff sidewind across the ice pack Tuesday night
and drove through near whiteout conditions that are common on the
Sound.
   Butcher had expressed hopes of finishing in under 11 days.
   ``I'll have to see how this team responds going over White
Mountain before I go for the all-time record,'' she had said
earlier.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the trail, the
Iditarod was started in 1973 to commemorate the 1925 emergency
delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from Anchorage to Nome by
sled dog teams running in relays.
   Of the 70 teams that began the race, seven mushers have
scratched and another was disqualified because of sick dogs.

   Three-time winner Susan Butcher and
defending champion Joe Runyan, their dog teams well rested, gained
on Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race leader Lavon Barve today as they
pulled into this checkpoint on Norton Sound.
   Resting his dogs only 3{ hours, Barve was about four hours ahead
of Butcher and Runyan when they left Kaltag, the last checkpoint on
the Yukon River, for the 90-mile run to Unalakleet, the gateway to
the Bering Sea.
   Butcher, with eight hours rest, and Runyan with five, were both
less than two hours behind Barve when they hit Unalakleet, where
racers were expected to rest about six hours before heading up the
coast for the last 170 miles to Nome.
   Leaving Kaltag behind Runyan were Tim Osmar, four-time champion
Rick Swenson, DeeDee Jonrowe and Robin Jackobson of Squaw Lake,
Minn.
   Runyan said any one of the first five racers could win the race
in the last 170-mile sprint to Nome.
   ``If you want to make a good bet, never bet on a dog race,'' he
said. ``It's really shaken out which team is healthy and really
fit. Looks to me like it's anybody's bet what's going on here.''
   Before leaving Kaltag, Runyan said the leaders in the 18th
running of the 1,158-mile race had come under the spell of what he
called the ``crazy syndrome.''
   ``Everybody's pushing pushing pushing,'' Runyan said.
   Runyan called his dogs ``little bio-mechanisms'' that have to be
understood, cared for and appreciated. ``The trick is to be
predictable for the dogs,'' said Runyan.
   Because of his habit of running behind his sled rather than
riding its rails when it heads up hills, Kaltag area residents have
begun calling him ``Runnin' Runyan.''
   Butcher said it was wrong to assume she was leading the race
from Anchorage to Nome just because she had been first to reach
Kaltag. She said everybody was running their own race with
different strategies.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the trail, the
Iditarod race was started in 1973 to commemorate the 1925 emergency
delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from Anchorage to Nome by
sled dog teams.
   Retired Col. Norman Vaughan, at 84 the oldest musher, was
reported in 63rd place in McGrath, 389 miles into the race. Vaughan
was a member of Admiral Byrd's Antarctic expedition and competed at
the Lake Placid, N.Y. Olympics in 1932.
   Six mushers have scratched out of the 70 who began the race
March 3.

   Lavon Barve clung to the lead Monday
as front-runners in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race began their
run up the Bering Sea coast to Nome.
   Barve of Wasilla arrived at 4:02 p.m. in this windswept coastal
community, the final checkpoint before mushers head across the
treacherous ice of Norton Bay.
   ``Once they get onto the ice, they can expect sudden storms and
an ample supply of wind,'' said Gail Somerville, an Iditarod
spokeswoman in Anchorage.
   Three-time winner Susan Butcher of Manley and defending champion
Joe Runyan of Nenana were trailing Barve by just a couple of hours,
Somerville said.
   ``They haven't checked in yet, but they're not too far behind,''
she said.
   Tim Osmar of Clam Gulch, Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow and Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers, the Iditarod's only four-time champion, had
reached Unalakleet, the largest community on the trail between
Eagle River and Nome.
   Barve, driving 14 dogs, was first out of Unakleet at 10:05 a.m.
But 50 miles earlier, at Kaltag, he rested his team only 3{ hours,
compared with eight hours for Butcher and five hours for Runyan.
   He didn't seem to think that was much of a handicap, however.
   ``My dogs are getting stronger with less rest,'' Barve said. ``I
think that's my advantage. My dogs always seem to recover fast.''
   Butcher, whose team had dropped to 12 dogs, said she would like
to be in front by the time the leaders reach White Mountain, just
77 miles from the finish of the 1,158-mile race.
   ``Unfortunately, that's not up to me as much as the other
guys,'' Butcher said. ``I'd like to shed them early but I don't
know if that's possible.
   ``And probably from what I know of Lavon's competitive spirit
and how he can do what he wants to do with that team, I may not
shed them at all.''
   Runyan said any one of the first five mushers could win the race
in the last 170-mile sprint to Nome.
   ``If you want to make a good bet, never bet on a dog race,'' he
said. ``It's really shaken out to which team is healthy and really
fit. Looks to me like it's anybody's bet what's going on here.''
   Before leaving Kaltag, Runyan said the leaders in the 18th
running of Iditarod had come under the spell of what he called the
``crazy syndrome.''
   ``Everybody's pushing, pushing, pushing,'' he said.
   Since 70 teams left Anchorage on March 3, seven mushers have
scratched and another has been disqualified because of sick dogs.
   The Iditarod, named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the

   Three-time Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race
champion Susan Butcher pressed for the lead in the Anchorage-to-Nome
race early today as a mob of rested mushers sprinted for this
Kuskokwim River community.
   Butcher pulled out of Nikolai early today and was expected in
McGrath, 407 miles into the 1,168-mile race, at midmorning. She was
followed by Martin Buser.
   Joe Runyan was the first musher to reach McGrath Tuesday
afternoon, but he hadn't taken his mandatory 24-hour rest.
   To complete the layover requirement, he could not leave town
until 4:43 p.m. today. Butcher took her 24-hour layover in Rohn and
could leave Runyan behind. The next 18 mushers behind Butcher also
have completed their layover.
   Butcher said she believed the frantic pace Runyan set had sapped
his dogs. ``It took him 15 hours to cross the (Farewell) Burn,'' she
said. ``It took me only 10.''
   Butcher blitzed into Nikolai, 359 miles into the race, just
before midnight Tuesday. Buser, four-time Iditarod champion Rick
Swenson, DeeDee Jonrow, Joe Redington and Joe Garnie pulled in
behind her within minutes.
   From McGrath, 761 miles remain in the race.
   Most of the 46 mushers remaining in the race were into or beyond
Rohn, 266 miles into the race.
   Runyan said he was running his own race and was trying not to
dwell on the progress of his competitors.
   ``I scratched last year,'' he said. ``Big psychological blow.''
   ``This year I looked at it, laid out a plan that I figured was
feasible. If that puts me in the money, great. If it doesn't, well
I'm gonna have a good trip.''
   Mushers are vying for a $250,000 purse, with $50,000 going to the
winner. Forty-nine mushers left the Iditarod starting line Saturday
in Anchorage. Norman Vaughan, Roger Roberts and Jan Masek, all
Alaskans, have dropped out.

<TEXT>
   Seventy dog teams and mushers were set
to start the ``Last Great Race on Earth'' on Saturday, the grueling
1,100-mile-long Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome.
   Teams were expected to encounter some of the harshest weather in
the race's 18-year history, said Race Manager Jack Niggemyer.
   Sub-zero temperatures accompanied by strong winds, the heaviest
snowfall in a quarter-century, ash from Redoubt Volcano and
starving, aggressive moose have combined to make it a tough year to
race and a tough year to train, he said.
   ``Awful weather,'' Niggemyer said. ``It's probably snowed 40
inches in the last two days.''
   The race usually lasts from 11 to 18 days. The record time, set
by Susan Butcher of Manley, Alaska, in 1987, is 11 days, two hours
and five minutes. Butcher won the race in 1986, 1987 and 1988.
   Some participants and race observers said they expect this
year's race to be slow going because of the deep snow and
poorly-packed trail.
   ``We might run out of trail,'' said Lavon Barve, a musher from
Wasilla, Alaska. ``It's up to the mushers to snowshoe or
whatever,'' he said. It will be Barve's ninth race; he finished
fifth last year.
   The Iditarod began in 1973. It commemorates the 1925 emergency
delivery of diphtheria serum to Nome on the Bering Sea. The serum,
taken overland by sled dog because airplanes couldn't get through,
was credited with saving hundreds of lives in the remote coastal
town.
   The trail begins in Anchorage and heads northwest across the
giant Alaska Range and onto the treeless tundra. Eventually it
winds along the Yukon River to the Bering Sea.
   Since 1973, the Iditarod has grown in fame and stature. This
year, mushers have come from as far as France and Switzerland.
Companies spend tens of thousands of dollars to sponsor top
competitors.
   Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, Alaska, the only person to win the
Iditarod four times, will be trying for a fifth win. Butcher will
attempt to equal Swenson's four-time win record.

<TEXT>
   Four-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson
was the first sled-dog racer to reach the highest checkpoint in the
grueling race as leading mushers made their way through the rugged
Alaska Range early today.
   Swenson, driving 18 dogs through the darkness, arrived at Rainy
Pass checkpoint at 5 a.m. He was followed four minutes later by Joe
Runyan of Nenana. Three-time champion Susan Butcher arrived at 5:22,
and DeeDee Jonrow of Bethel arrived four minutes later.
   The weather plagued mushers early today. In some spots, wind had
blown the trail clean of snow and the ice underneath was wearing the
dogs' feet.
   None of the four leaders has taken the 24-hour layover required
during the race.
   Three other mushers were on the trail from Finger Lake to Rainy
Pass, which is 226 miles into the race and at 3,400 feet elevation.
   Martin Buser, who was out front when the first mushers pulled
into Finger Lake late Sunday, declared his 24-hour layover and had
not moved by early today.
   Under the rules of the race, mushers are required to make a
24-hour stop at one of the race's 24 checkpoints; at the others,
they take whatever length of rest they believe they and the dogs
need. However, mushers are allowed to use the strategy of declaring
a 24-hour layover, then leaving after a couple of hours, in hopes of
getting a jump on their competitors.
   The 1,168-mile race began Saturday when 49 mushers left Anchorage
amid 46 mph gusts and a wind-chill reading of 22 degrees below zero.
Two mushers, Roger Roberts and Jan Masek, dropped out 151 miles into
the race.
   From Rainy Pass, the mushers have 942 miles to go before reaching
the finish on Nome's historic Front Street.
   The trail out of Rainy Pass contains dangerous dogleg descents on
icy trails clinging to steep embankments.
   Several mushers complained that parts of trail were difficult to
navigate. Reddington said getting over a bluff past the Yentna River
was virtually impossible.
   ``You need an elevator to get over that one,'' said Reddington,
who injured his two rear dogs Sunday when his sled crashed into them
and opted to take a 24-hour layover at Finger Lake.
   Inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to Nome for a diphtheria
outbreak in 1925, the Iditarod was founded in 1973. The winner this
year is to get $50,000 of the $250,000 purse. The remainder is
shared by the next 19 finishers.
   Most of the Iditarod mushers are from Alaska. Others are from
Montana, Minnesota, Wyoming, Georgia, New York, France and Japan.

   Declaring that she must ``do everything
right from here on in,'' Susan Butcher prepared to leave here late
Wednesday afternoon in her quest for a fourth consecutive victory in
the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher reached McGrath, 407 miles into the race, at 8:17 a.m.
Wednesday, about 15{ hours after Joe Runyan of Nenana became the
first musher to arrive in the Kuskokwim River community.
   Butcher was followed by four-time Iditarod winner Rick Swenson in
the No.3 position at 10:05 a.m. Dee Dee Jonrowe and Martin Buser
completed the top five, arriving in McGrath at 10:11 a.m. and 11:03
a.m., respectively. Another 10 mushers in the field of 45 pulled
into McGrath by late afternoon.
   Runyan said he would stay in the village for the 24-hour layover
required in the course of the 1,168-mile race from Anchorage to
Nome. Completing the layover meant Runyan was unable to leave
McGrath before 4:43 p.m. Wednesday.
   Twelve of the mushers still in the race Wednesday had not taken
their layovers. Many, including Butcher, completed them at Rohn.
   Butcher said the number of teams leading among the 45 still in
the race hadn't thinned as much as she expected. She also said she
believed the frantic pace Runyan set had sapped his dogs.
   ``It took him 15 hours to cross the (Farewell) Burn,'' she said.
``It took me only 10.''
   Forty-nine mushers left the Iditarod starting line Saturday in
Anchorage. Three dropped out relatively early in the race and a
fourth, David Aisenbrey, added his name to the scratch list
Wednesday. Officials at the Iditarod headquarters in Anchorage said
they did not know the reason for Aisenbrey's withdrawal.
   The annual Iditarod began 17 years ago and was inspired by a 1925
relay of serum to Nome during a diphtheria outbreak. The race, which
carries a $250,000 purse, is put on largely by volunteers.
   Gov. Steve Cowper has been among them, but he said Wednesday that
he no longer has the time to offer his services. Nonetheless, he
made it to Nikolai, the checkpoint before McGrath, to see some of
the activity.
   ``A lot of the mushers are pretty good friends of mine from way
back,'' Cowper said. ``I love this race and I'd do anything I can to
promote it.''
   The governor said musher and Iditarod founder Joe Redington, No.
14 in the rankings Wednesday afternoon, has offered to provide him
with a dog team if he wants to compete some year.
   ``That may be a little ways down the trail, as they say,'' said
Cowper, who is serving his first term. ``It probably won't work
until I leave my present employment.''

   Joe Redington stole the lead of the
1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Tuesday as he and Herbie
Nayokpuk sailed past other mushers who had packed down a smooth,
fast trail for them.
   Redington, a Wasilla resident who is a founder of the
16-year-old race, and Nayokpuk, of Shishmaref, took their mandatory
24-hour layovers on Sunday. The race leaders passed them by, only
to get bogged down in freshly fallen snow as they crossed the
Alaska Range.
   The leading mushers then took their mandatory layovers at Rohn,
271 miles from the race's start in Anchorage. They watched
helplessly as Redington and Nayokpuk _ and less than two hours
later, Joe Garnie of Teller _ powered past them.
   ``I kind of have this feeling in the back of my mind that we're
going to see two Eskimos _ Garnie and Nayokpuk _ blazing across
this state,'' said Jerry Austin, one of the mushers taking a
layover at Rohn.
   Joe Runyan of Nenana was the first musher to leave Rohn, at
10:30 p.m. Monday. But he has not declared his 24-hour layover, and
so is behind Redington, who left Rohn at 7:20 a.m. Tuesday.
Nayokpuk left Rohn two minutes behind Redington. Garnie left at 9
a.m.
   Still at Rohn, in the order in which they arrived, were: Jan
Masek of Anchorage; Lavon Barve of Wasilla; defending champion
Susan Butcher of Manley; Jacques Philip of Thomery, France; Austin,
of St. Michael; Tim Moerlein of Kasilof; and, in 11th place,
two-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson.
   From Rohn, the teams descend from the heights of the Alaska
Range into the timbered interior of the state for the longest
stretch between checkpoints in the race. Mushers must contend with
a bleak and treacherous area known as Farewell Burn before reaching
the next checkpoint, 93 miles away at Nikolai.
   The race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed
diphtheria serum to Nome during an outbreak of the disease. The top
20 mushers will split a purse of $150,000. The winner will get
$30,000.

   Mushers in the 1,168-mile Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race charged along Alaska's frozen west coast today in a tight
race to the finish line in this historic Gold Rush town.
   Joe Runyan, 40, of Nenana, led a pack of five front-runners in
the Anchorage-to-Nome trek today when he left White Mountain, 77
miles from the finish, with a five-minute lead over defending
champion Susan Butcher, 33, of Manley.
   Butcher, who has won the last three races, was down to 11 dogs _
several with diarrhea _ while Runyan was running 14.
   Race officials expected the winner to claim the $50,000
first-prize sometime around noon AST (4 p.m. EST).
   Rick Swenson, the only musher ever to win the race four times,
arrived in White Mountain an hour before Runyan left and said he had
given up hope of catching him. ``My goal now is to get it over
with,'' Swenson said.
   Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow and Lavon Barve of Wasilla were fourth
and fifth respectively.
   Forty-one of the 49 mushers who left Anchorage on March 4
remained in the race Tuesday. They use up to 18 dogs.
   The annual race began 17 years ago and was inspired by a sled-dog
relay of serum to Nome during a 1925 diphtheria outbreak. Butcher
finished the 1988 race in just under 11 days and 12 hours to set a
record.
   As they awaited the finishers, workers in Nome moved snow onto
historic Front Street, normally swept clean for traffic. The first
musher to cross the finish line wins $50,000 and $200,000 is divided
among the next 19 finishers.
   The race, whose trail is named for the gold mining ghost town of
Iditarod at the halfway point, attracts dozens of volunteers from
around the world.
   ``I think (author) Jack London put it best _ `It's the call of
the wild,''' Iditarod volunteer Peter Elstub said. ``It's a true
sporting event.''
   Elstub, a British Army soldier, has used his annual leave for
eight years to work for the Iditarod, performing tasks ranging from
telephone duty to dropping dog food along the trail. When military
duty kept him away in 1987, he telephoned Iditarod headquarters for
race updates.
   ``It don't matter where I am in the world,'' he said. ``I still
want me dog information.''
   Unlike some years in which weather was a major factor in the
outcome, this year's Iditarod has been blessed with almost ideal
conditions.
   Racers stop at 25 checkpoints along the route and are required to
make two extended rest stops, one for 24 hours, the other for six
hours.
   Commercial jets flying into Nome operated near capacity Tuesday
as mushers' families and other race watchers headed toward this town
of 4,300 people on Alaska's west coast. Pilots pointed out stretches
of the trail and encouraged passengers to keep their eyes open for
sled teams.
   Nome, which looks onto the frozen Norton Sound, took on a party
atmosphere helped by sunny skies and temperatures in the 20s. Singer
Hobo Jim, known for a song with the refrain ``I did, I did, I did
the Iditarod Trail,'' entertained customers at a Front Street saloon.
   For the locals, the Iditarod days ``give people a reason to be
outside and just walk around town and see what happened all winter
long while they were holed up in their houses,'' said Mary Knodel, a
shopkeeper whose store overlooks the finish line.
   Knodel said she doesn't root for individual mushers.
   ``After watching the race for all these years, you get to know
most of them,'' she said. ``It's like family. You don't like picking
one over another.''
   But Marylou Haggren, of Kodiak, was rooting for Butcher.
   ``We just got back from the Lower 48, and down there everyone's
talking basketball,'' she said. ``Different lifestyles, I guess.''

   Four-time winner Rick Swenson regained
the lead Wednesday in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, while a
musher miles behind him was trying to scare off curious buffaloes.
   Lavon Barve and three-time champion Susan Butcher were minutes
behind Swenson about a third of the way through the 1,158-mile race
from Anchorage to Nome.
   ``There's a lot of strong teams this year,'' said Butcher,
warning that there's still plenty of time for surprises. ``We've
got a long way to go yet.''
   Swenson led the race Monday topping the Alaska Range at
3,500-foot Rainy Pass, but was overtaken by defending champion Joe
Runyan at Rohn on Tuesday.
   He had a cut on his face and a cracked plastic runner on his
sled as he mushed away from this Athabascan Indian village of 110
people at Iditarod milepost 367.
   Swenson said the damage wouldn't stop him from reaching McGrath,
the next checkpoint 48 miles from here, where he either would
repair the runner or change sleds.
   Behind Swenson on the trail through Farewell Burn, eighth-place
racer Tim Osmar of Clam Gulch fired shots into the air to clear the
trail of several buffaloes.
   The Iditarod Trail is named for a tiny ghost town it passes
through. The race commemorates the 1925 emergency delivery by relay
dog teams of life-saving diphtheria serum to Nome.
   Butcher won the race in 1986, 1987 and 1988 and took second
place last year. Swenson won in 1977, 1979, 1981 and 1982. He has
finished in the top 10 every year since 1973, when the Iditarod was
started.

   Fresh snow on the trail continued to slow
the pace of the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race as mushers
slogged their way down from the frosted peaks of the Alaska Range.
   On Monday, Jan Masek of Anchorage led a tightly grouped caravan
of more than 20 mushers to Rohn Roadhouse, a remote log-cabin
checkpoint 271 miles from the start in Anchorage.
   Masek arrived at 3:10 p.m., followed eight minutes later by
Lavon Barve of Wasilla. Defending champion Susan Butcher arrived at
3:20 p.m., followed closely by Jerry Austin of St. Michael and
Jacques Philip of Thomery, France.
   Tim Moerlein of Kasilof pulled in at 3:31 p.m., trailed four
minutes later by four-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson, in
seventh position.
   By 8:30 p.m., half the 52 mushers in the race had made it to
Rohn. The rest were spread the 78 miles back to Finger Lake.
   Racers were slowed by up to 6 inches of new snow as they mushed
down to Rohn from Rainy Pass, at 3,400 feet the highest point along
the trail.
   Rohn is a favorite point for mushers to take the 24-hour layover
required of all mushers sometime during the Anchorage-to-Nome race.
The isolated cabin provides a refuge from spectators and reporters,
and the dogs often are tired from crossing the rugged mountains.
   The race, which started at 9 a.m. Saturday, has been slower than
last year's record-setting pace, when Butcher reached Nome after 11
days, 2 hours on the trail.
   The race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed
diphtheria serum to Nome during an outbreak of the disease. The top
20 mushers will split a purse of $150,000. The winner will get
$30,000.

   One musher in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race and his dogs were safe today after he had to kill an attacking
moose with five pistol shots.
   Defending champion Joe Runyan held the lead today after passing
four-time winner Rick Swenson in the 1,160-mile race.
   Lorren Weaver, holding 44th place among the 68 racers still in
the race and 78 miles behind Runyan, killed a moose that attacked
his dogs on the trail between Skwentna and Finger Lake, race
officials said.
   Searchers had set out on snowmobiles Monday after two bush
pilots reported seeing the moose attack a team of dogs.
   One dog was gashed across the head, but Weaver, 50, a physician
fron Knik, and his team were otherwise unhurt. They continued into
Finger Lake, checkpoint No. 7 and 193 miles from the start of the
race from Anchorage to Nome that started Saturday.
   Race spokeswoman Debbie Croutch said the moose was without
antlers, but there was no report on whether it was a bull or a cow.
Bulls often have dropped their racks this by time of year.
   Attacks by hungry moose plagued racers during training this
year, and some mushers carried rifles for protection. The animals,
which weigh up to 1,800 pounds, have become aggressive because deep
snow has made it hard to graze.
   Runyan and five other veteran racers overtook Swenson during the
sprint Monday from Rainy Pass to Rohn, 271 miles into the race. The
group passing Swenson included his archrival, Susan Butcher.
   Swenson is the only person to have won the race four times.
Butcher won in 1986, 1987 and 1988, and took second place last year.
   The Iditarod race runs from Anchorage to Nome, on the Bering Sea
coast, and crosses frozen rivers, treeless tundra and huge mountain
passes. Usually the race lasts 11 to 18 days or longer, depending
on weather and other conditions.
   Seventy mushers and dog teams left Anchorage on Saturday.
   The Iditarod, named after a ghost town along the trail,
commemorates the delivery by sled dog teams of a life-saving
diphtheria serum to Nome in 1925.

   Champion dog-sledder Susan Butcher told
President Bush on Friday that she has plans for her own brand of
U.S.-Soviet detent.
   If all goes well, Butcher said, there will be a 1,000-mile dog
sled race between Alaska and Siberia.
   Bush welcomed Butcher and her prize sled dog, Granite, to the
White House to congratulate her on her fourth win of the annual
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race across Alaska.
   Butcher and her team of dogs made the 1,158-mile Anchorage to
Nome run in a record 11 days, 1 hour and 53 minutes last month. She
broke her 1987 record by more than 10 minutes after braving
temperatures that dropped to 40 below zero and 100 mph winds that
ripped across the Bering Sea.
   Arriving at the White House in a shortsleeve spring dress while
others were bundled up in winter garb against a cold rain, Butcher
professed not to be cold, even when waiting outside while Bush's
meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze ran long.
   ``I just finished a 440-mile race the day before yesterday in
the Arctic. It was 20 below,'' she laughingly told Bush as they
posed for photos with Granite in the Rose Garden.
   She gave Bush a photograph of the Iditarod race signed by the
top 20 finishers after the president emerged from his Oval Office
meetings to make superpower summit preparations.
   She also told him about plans for the Alaska-to-Siberia race.
The Soviets already have agreed, and the race will go 800 miles
into the Soviet Union.
   Butcher, 35, who is generally recognized as the greatest sled
dog racer in the world, told Bush she started her mushing career in
Maine, the president's vacation home since his boyhood. She is a
native of Massachusetts.
   Butcher and her husband live in a wilderness cabin, 140 miles
northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska, with a brood of dogs that numbers
as many of 150. She breeds the dogs for other dog sled racers.
   Only one other musher, Rick Swenson, has won the Iditarod four
times.

   Susan Butcher, who won the last two
Iditarod dog-sled races with Rick Swenson on her heels, chased
Swenson on Tuesday as the two winningest mushers in race history
fought for the early lead in the 1,100-mile trek.
   Joe Runyan of Nenana actually was farthest along the trail early
Tuesday. But he had not yet taken his mandatory 24-hour rest stop,
while Swenson, Butcher and five others declared theirs at Rohn,
which is 266 miles from the start in Anchorage and 902 miles from
the finish line in Nome.
   Swenson, Butcher and DeeDee Jonrowe of Willow were expected to
start racing about noon AST Tuesday.
   Historically, Iditarod front-runners have faded badly by the time
they reached Nome, more than 1,100 miles from the start.
   In past years, Butcher, who has won the last three races, and
Swenson, the only four-time winner, have been content to bide their
time, making their moves much later in the race.
   But this year Swenson and Butcher went straight to the front. He
led Butcher into Rohn by 13 minutes.
   ``It just worked out that way,'' Swenson said of their quick
start. ``The thing is there was no one else that was going to go.''
   The two intense, outspoken competitors used to be neighbors in
Manley, but Swenson has moved to Two Rivers. Their rivalry has grown
to epic proportions throughout the state.
   ``I think I can beat her ... but she's got a good team, and she
might beat us all,'' Swenson said. He said his team this year is
better than the one that was runner-up to Butcher last year.
   On Monday, three people escaped serious injury when a
single-engine airplane chartered by an Anchorage TV station crashed
while covering the race.
   The field of mushers dwindled to 46 Monday night when 83-year-old
Norman Vaughan called it quits at Skwentna, just 151 miles into the
race. Two other mushers dropped out earlier at Big Lake, only 71
miles along the way.
   Inpired by a dog-sled relay of serum to Nome for a diphtheria
outbreak in 1925, the Iditarod was founded in 1973. The winner this
year is to get $50,000 of the $250,000 purse. The remainder will be
shared by the next 19 finishers.
   Most of the Iditarod mushers are from Alaska. Others are from
Montana, Minnesota, Wyoming, New York, France and Japan.

   Big Lake musher Martin Buser was first
in line and on his way to the Alaska Range on Sunday as the leaders
in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race sorted themselves out in the
early stages of the contest.
   Forty-nine mushers streaked out of Anchorage on Saturday on the
first leg of the 1,168-mile race from Anchorage to Nome.
   Buser, 30, reached the Skwentna checkpoint some 150 miles into
the race at 3:53 a.m. AST Sunday. He and his 20-dog team were out
and on his way to Finger Lake, 45 miles farther down the trail, at
7:44 a.m.
   Buser, who finished third last year and paced the leaders for
much of that race, was followed out by Jerry Austin of St. Michael
at 9:13 a.m. Austin dropped two dogs at the checkpoint, leaving with
16.
   Four-time champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers raced out of
Skwentna 21 minutes later.
   The leaders were followed by about a dozen other mushers,
including Iditarod winners Rick Mackey of Trapper Creek, Susan
Butcher of Manley and Libby Riddles of Nome.
   The race, inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to Nome for a
diptheria outbreak in 1925, began in 1973. It has become the
nation's most famous sled-dog and commands a first prize this year
of $50,000 and total prize money of $250,000.
   Wind up to 46 mph that raked mushers in the first hours of the
race abated Sunday and it was clear and cold.
   But race volunteer Bob Nobmann said the leaders were taking
longer that normal to reach the first checkpoint. ``We think it was
slow going between the wind and the ice, tough going,'' he said.
   From Skwentna, Buser, Austin and the others headed to Finger
Lake, a wide spot in the trail with a population of two residents.
From Finger Lake, the trail climbs into the Alaska Range at Rainy
Pass, the highest spot on the race route at 3,400 feet.
   The 17th annual race began with Austin first out of the chute.
Before the contest is over, mushers will trek over the Alaska Range,
across desolate expanses and along a storm-raked coastline.
   Riddles, 1985 champion and the first woman to win the marathon
race, said she thought the cold and wind Saturday might have been
good for dog teams, cooling them off in the early stretches where
they tend to overheat in the excitement.
   Most of the Iditarod mushers are from Alaska. Others are from
Montana, Minnesota, Wyoming, Georgia, New York, France and Japan.

   The 70-year-old founder of the Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race streteched his lead Sunday as front-runners and
their dog teams passed the last checkpoint on the Yukon River
section of the race.
   Joe Redington pulled out of Kaltag, on the Yukon River, at 4:22
a.m. and turned toward Unalakleet, 90 miles away on the wind-swept
Norton Sound coast.
   Redington had left only nine of the 15 dogs with which he began.
Race rules require mushers to arrive in Nome with at least five
dogs in harness.
   Leaving Kaltag 2{ hours after Redington was Martin Buser of Big
Lake, who had passed Redington early Saturday before falling back
into second place again Sunday. Buser still had 13 dogs in harness,
one fewer than Saturday.
   Buser had arrived in Kaltag only 23 minutes behind Redington.
The town is 798 miles from Anchorage, where the 1,100-mile race
began March 5.
   Defending champion Susan Butcher, who won the last two races in
record times, left at the tiny village at 8:18 a.m., and four-time
champion Rick Swenson at 9:58 a.m., both with 12 dogs.
   The next checkpoint is Unalakleet, about 90 miles away on the
coast of Norton Sound. From Unalakleet, the teams run north along
the coast, open to the region's sudden storms and raking winds.
   The first musher to reach Nome will collect $30,000 of a
$150,000 purse; the next 19 finishers will split the rest. Three of
the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out, including one
Saturday.
   Redington, who founded the race in 1973, has never won, although
he has competed in all but two Iditarods.
   Redington had paced the race for more than 400 miles, before
Buser pulled out of Galena an hour ahead of him Saturday. Buser
also arrived first at the Nulato checkpoint, but then warm weather
forced both men to wait until dark before setting out for Kaltag.
   American mushers from outside Alaska were paced by Robin
Jacobson of Minnetonka, Minn., in 13th place. John Patten of Grand
Marais, Minn., was 24th; Frank Teasley, Jackson, Wyo., 27th; Terry
Adkins, Mikado, Mich., 31st; Dan McEachen, Snowmass Village, Colo.,
34th; and Stan Ferguson, Philadelphia, 45th.

   Cheering crowds and a blaring siren greeted
Joe Runyan on Wednesday when he and 11 dogs pulled into this
historic gold mining town to claim the 17th annual Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race.
   It took the Nenana musher slightly more than 11 days to cover the
1,168 miles from Anchorage. His wife and baby watched as he won
$50,000 of the $250,000 purse to be shared by the first 20 finishers.
   The victory gave Runyan, 40, the ``triple crown'' in
long-distance dog mushing. Last year, he won the Alpirod, the more
sedate European version of the Iditarod, and in 1985, he won the
1,000-mile Yukon Quest from Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, to
Fairbanks.
   Runyan said his dogs were in good shape after the grueling trek.
   ``We've gone over 200 miles in 24 hours,'' he said. ``The Alaska
husky is unlike any animal on Earth. They can go 100 miles a day on
rough terrain and they can take it.''
   Runyan snapped a three-year winning streak by Susan Butcher of
Manley, but failed by about three hours to break her 1987 record
time. When he crossed the finish line, Butcher was about five miles
behind. The only other musher to win more than one Iditarod is
four-time champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, who was running
fourth when Runyan finished.
   Runyan, who runs a kennel about 50 miles from Fairbanks, said his
main goal simply was to reach the finish first. ``I didn't care
about the record,'' he said. ``There's always room for fine-honing
(next year).''
   Butcher, who came in second an hour and four minutes behind
Runyan, had struggled to keep up after beating him by two minutes at
the race half-way point of Iditarod, for which she won $3,000 in
silver ingots. Only once in race history has the halfway winner gone
on to victory.
   Illnesses among her dogs made it difficult to run a stronger
race, Butcher said at the finish line. The problems included
diarrhea and leg disorders that required her to bandage some of the
animals.
   She gave each of her 11 dogs a congratulatory pat after pulling
into the finish chute. ``I'm really proud of them,'' Butcher said.
   Runyan arrived in White Mountain, about 77 miles from the finish
early Wednesday. Swenson arrived in White Mountain an hour before
Runyan left, but said Runyan's team was just too strong for him to
catch.
   ``My goal now is to get it over with,'' said Swenson, who trailed
Butcher. Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow and Lavon Barve of Wasilla were
fourth and fifth, respectively.
   ``I'm kind of feeling sorry for how we have to run the dogs at
the end,'' Jonrowe said Tuesday. ``I had to drop my leader. His foot
was sore.''
   Forty-nine mushers left the starting line in Anchorage on March
4. Eight scratched along the way.
   Nome, the last town of any size before the International Date
Line, took on a party atmosphere Tuesday, helped by sunny skies and
temperatures that rose to the 20s.
   Workers in Nome, which has 4,300 people and looks out over the
frozen Norton Sound, moved snow onto Front Sreet, normally swept
clean for traffic, in anticipation of the mushers' arrival.
   Volunteers at the Iditarod office a block away updated race
standings from reports submitted by ham radio operators along the
trail.
   ``I think (author) Jack London put it best _ `It's the call of
the wild.''' volunteer Peter Elstub said.
   Elstub, a British soldier, said he had come to Alaska for eight
of the last 17 races. In 1987, when he was on duty in the Falkland
Islands, he telephoned Iditarod headquarters for race updates, he
said.
   For locals, the Iditarod days ``give people a reason to be
outside and just walk around town and see what happened all winter
long while they were holed up in their houses,'' said Mary Knodel, a
shopkeeper whose store overlooks the finish line.
   Marylou Haggren, a Kodiak resident, said she and her husband made
hotel reservations a year ago for Iditarod week in Nome.
   ``We just got back from the Lower 48, and down there everyone's
talking basketball,'' Mrs. Haggren said as she lingered in the
Iditarod office. ``Different lifestyles, I guess.''

   A 70-year-old man known as the ``Father
of the Iditarod' pocketed $2,500 in silver ingots today for being
the first to reach the half-way point of the 1,100-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Joe Redington of Knik reached the Cripple checkpoint at 5:40
a.m. His nearest competitor, Herbie Nayokpuk of Shishmaref, checked
into Ophir, 55 miles behind Redington, at 11:10 p.m. Wednesday.
   Redington, a founder of the mushing marathon from Anchorage to
Nome, now heads for the Sulatna Crossing and then to Ruby on the
Yukon River. He has raced in all but two of the 16 Iditarods,
finishing three times in fifth place.
   Four-time champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers was running third.
He checked out of Takotna at 8:37 p.m. Wednesday. He was followed
by Joe Garnie of Teller, Jan Masek of Anchorage and DeeDee Jonrowe
of Bethel.
   Defending champion Susan Butcher of Manley was seventh.
   Several racers said that despite Redington's lead, Nayokpuk is
now the musher to beat because of his strong dog team.
   ``I think it's going to take us quite a while to gain that kind
of time back, unless he runs into some kind of situation up
ahead,'' Swenson said.
   A blizzard pounding Alaska's southwestern coast threatened to
turn into complicate things on the Iditarod trail for the racers.
If the gale-driven snow reaches inland to the Iditarod Trail, the
going could turn slow.
   At the back of the pack, 290 miles behind the leaders, the
oldest Iditarod musher announced that he was dropping out of the
race. Norman Vaughan, 82, said three of his dogs were in heat and
he had whiteout conditions ahead.
   Another musher, Ray Dronenburg of Trapper Creek, also scratched
Wednesday, saying several of his dogs were weak with a virus. That
leaves 50 mushers in the race, which started Saturday.
   A $30,000 first prize awaits the winner, who is expected to
reach Nome sometime next week. The next 19 finishers will split the
rest of the $150,000 purse.

   Among the perils threatening the 70
racers and dog teams who mush today in the 18th annual Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race are hunger-crazed moose and ash from the
Redoubt Volcano.
   Not to mention the weather.
   Temperatures hit the 40s and turned snow into slush on the
streets of downtown Anchorage, where the race begins. But
conditions are some of the harshest in the history of the race
along the 1,100-mile trail to Nome on the Bering Sea.
   ``Awful weather,'' said Race Manager Jack Niggemyer. ``It's
probably snowed 40 inches in the last two days.''
   The heavy snow has kept moose from grazing, setting the stage
for violent encounters between the huge animals and sled dog teams
on the remote trail, and prudent mushers are packing rifles.
   Redoubt has been erupting intermittently since December, spewing
ash as far north as the area around Anchorage.
   The race usually lasts from 11 to 18 days. The record time, set
by Susan Butcher of Manley in 1987, was 11 days, two hours and five
minutes. Butcher also won in 1986 and 1988.
   Since Libby Riddles became the first woman to win in 1985, women
have won the race four of the last five years, inspiring a popular
T-shirt saying, ``Alaska: Where men are men and women win the
Iditarod.''
   Some participants and race observers said they expect the pace
to be slowed this year because of the deep snow and poorly-packed
trail.
   ``We might run out of trail,'' said Lavon Barve, a musher from
Wasilla who finished fifth last year. ``It's up to the mushers to
snowshoe or whatever.''
   The Iditarod was begun in 1973 to commemorate the emergency
delivery of diphtheria serum to Nome by mail carriers driving dog
teams in 1925.
   Taken overland after bad weather grounded airplanes, the serum
was credited with saving hundreds of lives in the remote town.
   From downtown Anchorage, the course goes northwest across the
Alaska Range and over the tundra before dropping down along the
Yukon River to the Bering Sea.
   Mushers must lay over for 24 hours of rest at some point along
the trail.
   The mystique of the Iditarod has grown steadily, with mushers
this year arriving from France and Switzerland. Companies spend
tens of thousands of dollars to sponsor top competitors.
   Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, the only person to win the Iditarod
four times, will be trying for a fifth win.
   Last year's winner, Joe Runyan of Nenana, expects the teams to
start out slow because of bad weather.
   ``The big strategy this year in terms of snow is to reduce
injury,'' Runyan said.
   But the teams can't afford to be too slow, he said.
   ``Even if you're conservative, it's better to be in the front of
the pack.''

   Joe Runyan clung to his narrow lead in the
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race as he approached the halfway point
Thursday in the 1,168-mile Anchorage-to-Nome trek.
   Runyan led the field into McGrath late Tuesday but surrendered
his lead when he decided to take the 24-hour rest stop required of
all mushers somwehere along the trail.
   Most of the other top teams had stopped earlier, accounting in
part for Runyan's early lead. But storming out of McGrath on
Wednesday evening, the rested Runyan quickly regained the lead.
   He left Ophir at 4:45 a.m. with a nine-minute edge on four-time
winner Rick Swenson.
   Five minutes behind Swenson was DeeDee Jonrowe, who held the lead
briefly Wednesday. Defending champion Susan Butcher moved out 12
minutes later, and Martin Buser was about 20 minutes behind her.
   Behind the leaders was a pack of 14 mushers, including race
founder Joe Redington and Jacques Philip of France. Forty-nine
mushers left the Iditarod starting line Saturday in Anchorage. Four
have dropped out.
   The next checkpoint is Iditarod, the ghost town for which the
trail and race are named. The first musher to reach Iditarod will
get $3,000 in silver ingots. The race carries a $250,000 purse, with
the winner getting $50,000.
   Iditarod is 610 miles from Nome and 558 miles from Anchorage.

   Musher Joe Runyan pulled ahead of three-time
winner Susan Butcher on Tuesday to take the lead in the final dash
across the frozen Bering Sea to Nome in the 1,168-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   The Nevana man finished the 48-mile first leg of the final 171
miles 41 minutes ahead of Butcher, who started the day at Koyuk with
a nine-minute lead. Runyan and his 15-dog team reached a checkpoint
at this Bering Sea village at 2:03 p.m.
   Butcher, from Manley, logged in at 2:44 p.m. with 11 dogs. Third
was Rick Swenson, a four-time Iditarod winner from Two Rivers, who
arrived at 4:05 p.m.
   Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow hit the trail Tuesday morning two hours
and three minutes after Swenson.
   The winner is expected to reach Nome on Wednesday morning after
brief stops at three remaining checkpoints.
   The first musher to cross the finish line on Nome's historic
Front Street wins $50,000. The remaining $200,000 is divided among
the next 19 finishers.
   With continued good weather expected, the final 171 miles of the
race across the ice of Norton Sound and along the hilly coastline to
Nome will boil down to speed and endurance.
   All four leaders took their final mandatory rest stops Monday in
Unalakleet.
   Although Butcher has fewer dogs remaining in her team than
Runyan, she said they appeared to be getting stronger.
   ``They're doing the Butcher tricks for me,'' she said early
Tuesday. ``They know where they are (in the race).''
   As of midday Tuesday, 41 mushers remained in the race; eight have
scratched since the race began March 4 in Anchorage.
   The annual race began 17 years ago and was inspired by a 1925
relay of serum to Nome during a diphtheria outbreak. The race is put
on largely by volunteers.

   The goodwill resulting from a thaw in
relations between Alaska and the Soviet Union is spreading from
people to dogs.
   Susan Butcher, a three-time winner of the 1,100-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race, was to leave Friday for the Soviet Far East
along with a veterinarian and two Iditarod Trail Committee
officials.
   The group has three goals:
   _ Find two Soviet mushers who would live in Manley with Butcher
and her husband, Dave Monson, another winning musher, and learn the
ropes about sled dog racing, Alaska-style.
   _ Examine sled dogs used in the Soviet Union for size and
stamina comparisons with their Alaska counterparts.
   _ Organize a committee on the Soviet side of the Bering Strait
that would help lay out a route for a new, international sled dog
race which would start in Nome and end in the U.S.S.R., after
contestants had been flown across the strait.
   Ginna Brelsford, with the Alaska Office of International Trade
and a member of the Bering Bridge Expedition which traveled 1,000
miles last spring by sled dog and kayak from the Soviet Far East to
Alaska, helped arrange this week-long trip.
   ``All that sounds easy, but it's amazing how much time it takes
to get things done over there,'' Brelsford said of the goals for
Butcher's trip.
   The Soviets are no strangers to using dogs in the Arctic, but
they lag far behind the U.S. in developing racing equipment and
techniques, she said.
   ``When we introduced our sleds, they were excited about how
light and how flexible they were and how easily they could be taken
apart,'' Brelsford said of her trek last spring.
   ``They still operate with heavy leather harnesses and use ivory
hooks to connect things. Their technology is old when it comes to
using dogs and sleds.''
   ``Generally, they use freight animals _ dogs bigger than what
you see running the Iditarod but not necessarily better,''
Brelsford said.
   Monson and Butcher have 120 dogs in their Manley kennel, but
Monson said they always are looking for new bloodlines.
   ``Anything that will improve the general makeup of a sled dog so
it would perform better would be of interest,'' Monson said.
   The new race would be operated separately from the Iditarod,
said Rosemary Phillips, executive director of the race established
in 1973.
   ``We will not be taking anything from the Iditarod Sled Dog Race
to put this on, excepting experience,'' Phillips said. ``We've had
very positive responses from mushers _ lots and lots of calls
wondering how they could enter.''
   The race would be run about the end of March, at least two weeks
after the winner of the Iditarod crosses the finish line in Nome,
she said.
   ``Mushers are a sturdy bunch. You might see much the same teams
in there from the Iditarod.''
   The route would be from Nome to Wales in Alaska. From there,
mushers and dogs would be flown across the Bering Strait for a
restart in Uelen in the U.S.S.R. and the eventual finish at Anadyr,
she said.
   ``We would love to do it in 1990,'' Phillips said.
``Realistically speaking, it probably will be 1991.''
   The group also will be recruiting Soviet mushers and teams for
the Iditarod.
   ``Things like this just serve to break down the barriers,''
Phillips said. ``It's making the world smaller.''

<TEXT>
   With only 357 miles left, the leaders in
the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race turned toward Alaska's windblown
coast Sunday.
   Three-time Iditarod champion Susan Butcher left this Yukon River
village at 6:55 p.m. AST, with veteran musher Martin Buser one
minute behind her.
   Joe Runyan, driving 17 dogs, had led the pack of five leaders
into Kaltag earlier in the day. Buser arrived about an hour later,
crouching on the back of his sled, brushing his teeth.
   He was followed into the village seven minutes later by Butcher,
who drove her team up the Yukon River, loudly singing a pop tune.
   From Kaltag, the mushers race toward the coastal village of
Unalakleet, 93 miles away and the longest stretch between
checkpoints in the race. From there, they sprint toward the $250,000
jackpoint waiting at the finish line on Nome's historic Front Street.
   The musher who finishes first wins $50,000; the rest is shared
among the next 19 finishers.
   The leaders _ Butcher, Buser, Runyan, DeeDee Jonrowe and
four-time champion Rick Swenson _ have been out front of the pack
since they left the gold mining ghost town of Iditarod, the half-way
point 558 miles into the race.
   Forty-one mushers remain in the 1,168-mile contest, the lowest
number since 1985. Eight have scratched since the race started March
3 in Anchorage.

FOR 5TH TIME  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Swenson, who last won the event in 1982, finished in 12 days, 16 hours, 34
minutes, 39 seconds to win $50,000 and a new truck. In 16 Iditarod
competitions, he has never finished out of the top 10.;    The victory
rewarded Swenson's boldness in mushing his dog team into a bitter winter storm
from White Mountain, the next-to-last checkpoint, and deflecting the challenge
of his chief rival, Susan Butcher of Eureka, who was seeking to become the
top-winning Iditarod competitor.;    Butcher, winner of four of the last five
Iditarods, and the event record-holder with a time of 11 days, 1 hour, 53
minutes was one of three front-runners who headed into the bad weather, but
then turned back early Thursday. Before the storm, she was viewed as the
likely winner.;    Butcher, Joe Runyan, the 1989 champion from Nenana, and Tim
Osmar, a perennial contender from Clam Gulch, gambled that the harshness of
the weather would exhaust the dog teams of Swenson and Martin Buser of Big
Lake, the only competitors to plow through the whiteout conditions that often
obliterated the trail.;    "If I was going to walk, I wasn't going to turn
back," said Swenson. "As long as I stayed on the trail, I wasn't going to
die.";    Buser, a four-time finisher in the top 10, hung on to finish second
and win $39,500. He arrived at the Front Street finish line 2 hours, 7
minutes, 15 seconds behind Swenson.;    Butcher finished third, 5 1/2 hours
behind Swenson.;    "You couldn't tell if you were going up, down or
sideways," Swenson said about the worst stretches of trail. "You couldn't tell
anything. I never worked so hard for anything in my life.;    "It was a little
scary and it was stressful. It was not a pleasant night.";    Swenson said he
didn't even know the others had gone back, but he was determined to push on.; 
  "There was no prize in White Mountain," he said.;    Swenson expressed
surprise that Butcher didn't fight the storm.;    "She's gonna have to get six
now if she wants to be top dog," he said.;    Butcher, in a concession speech
at White Mountain, said she was "very, very, very happy for Rick."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Hypothermal Musher Rescued in Dog-Sled Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A helicopter crew flew to a remote
encampment Saturday to rescue a competitor in the Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race who was reported to be suffering from hypothermia and
shock.
   Mike Madden, 27, of North Pole, was rescued by a military
helicopter at about 9:30 a.m., eight hours after fellow musher Jerry
Austin told race officials that Madden needed help, members of the
race board said.
   Madden was 30 miles east of the checkpoint at Iditarod, which
marks the half-way point of the 1,168 mile race. Race officials said
Madden's condition stabilized after he was flown to McGrath en route
to an Anchorage hospital.
   The National Weather Service in Anchorage said the low
temperature in Iditarod early Saturday was probably about 5 degrees.
   An HH-3 ``Jolly Green Giant'' helicopter from Elmendorf Air Force
Base flew a doctor, accompanied by Austin, to help Madden, who also
was reported to have injured his knee while chopping dogfood earlier
in the race.
   Austin intended to take care of Madden's dogs after the
evacuation, said Leo Rasmussen, president of the Iditarod board. The
detour was a setback for Austin, who has already been hampered by
sick dogs.
   ``It destroys his chances for a top 20 finish, and will probably
make him one of the last teams to come into Nome,'' race board
member Tom Busch said. Busch added that three rookie mushers who
stayed with Madden while Austin was fetching help probably ruined
their chances for the Rookie of the Year award.
   Madden, a carpenter, moved to Alaska from Billings, Mont., in
1983 and began mushing the following year. He was running in the
Iditarod for the first time.
   Veteran musher Martin Buser led the Anchorage-to-Nome race on its
eighth day. Buser, 30, left Grayling at 3:34 a.m., about four hours
ahead of Susan Butcher and Rick Swenson. Grayline is 497 miles from
the finish line in Nome.
   Butcher has won the last three races and Swenson is a four-time
champion. Buser, who runs a kennel in Big Lake, has never won the
Iditarod but finished third in last year's race.
   With Madden apparently out of the race, the field of contenders
fell to 41, the lowest figure since 1985. Forty-nine mushers were in
the lineup when the race began March 4.
   Mushers are vying for a $250,000 purse, including $50,000 for the
winner.

A moose knocked four-time winner Rick Swenson out of the lead of the Iditarod 
Trail Sled Dog Race today, stomping through his team and slowing him enough to 
allow defending champion Joe Runyan to move in front. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson had left McGrath hours before anyone else, but he turned back after the 
run-in with the moose and waited for other racers to try their luck with the 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
A veterinarian checked out one of Swenson's injured dogs, which was pronounced 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
Nine other racers set out before dawn -- none reporting any more moose -- but 
Swenson waited for daylight before returning to the trail, and that dropped him 
to 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson said he saw the moose ahead of him at the first river portage about a 
mile out of McGrath and was trying to cross the river ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
"She was on the river," Swenson said. "It was just one of those normal races to 
see who would get there first." 
</P>
<P>
Swenson said he had hoped the moose would keep going, but it turned into his 
team, trampling some of the dogs and turning them back on the sled. 
</P>
<P>
While Swenson waited, the nine who set out included Runyan, Lavon Barve and 
three-time winner Susan Butcher. Runyan was first into the next checkpoint 23 
miles away at Takotna and headed on to Ophir, a ghost town left from 
turn-of-the-century gold mining days. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in McGrath rerouted the race through town because of deep snow along 
the usual Kuskokwim River route. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Butcher came upon seventh-placed Tim Osmar as he fired shots into 
the air to scare off a buffalo that would not leave the trail. 
</P>
<P>
"Susan Butcher showed up in her red (snow) suit and that's what did it," Osmar 
said. "She scared the buffalo right on." 
</P>
<P>
Mushers are encountering some of the 800 animals that freely roam Alaska in 
five herds. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 18 of the 68 teams still in the endurance run from Anchorage to Nome

   Strong winds and unseasonably warm
temperatures whittled a 70-year-old musher's lead in the 1,150-mile
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race to a matter of minutes, according to
standings this morning.
   At last report, Joe Redington, known as the ``Father of the
Iditarod'' because he helped organize the first race 16 years ago,
still was on the trail between Cripple and Sulatna Crossing today,
the seventh day of the race.
   It's only 47 miles between the two checkpoints, and the length
of time it was taking Redington to cover the distance was a
reflection of the weather. Normally, Iditarod teams average 8-10
mph.
   All 50 dog teams in the race from Anchorage to Nome were slowed
Thursday by temperatures that climbed into the 40s, turning the
trail soggy and overheating the cold-loving huskies who pull the
sleds.
   Redington waited 11 hours after reaching Cripple for more
favorable weather, and by the time he decided to move, second-place
Herbie Nayokpuk decided his team was rested enough to push on.
   Nayokpuk, known as the Shishmaref Cannonball, had arrived in
Cripple more than six hours behind Redington, but he left at 3:20
p.m., only five minutes after the leader.
   In third place was Martin Buser of Big Lake, who pulled into
Cripple at 2:50 p.m. He was followed by four-time Iditarod champion
Rick Swenson of Two Rivers at 3:20 p.m.; Joe Garnie of Teller at
3:22 p.m.; and defending champion Susan Butcher of Manley at 4:35
p.m.
   Redington, who arrived in Cripple, 525 miles from the start, at
4:50 a.m., tried leaving at 9 a.m. Thursday, but the sun-softened
snow turned him around.
   ``No use to fight that. Let it harden up a little bit,'' he said
just before leaving Thursday afternoon. ``The dogs were right up to
their bellies, going along about 4 to 5 miles an hour. I went out
about three miles and came back. Thought I'd wait a while.''
   The delay gave an advantage to teams that have been hounding
Redington since he took the lead 260 miles back in Rohn, but he
said there was little choice, given the soft trail.
   ``It doesn't hurt to give the dogs a little more rest,'' he said.
   From Cripple, the trail heads to Ruby, on the Yukon River, then
follows the frozen river to Kaltag and cuts over to Unalakleet on
the Bering Sea coast.
   The first musher to reach Nome will win $30,000. The next 19
finishers will split the rest of a $150,000 purse.
   Two teams have dropped out of the race, and two of the more than
800 dogs running have died, race officials said. Both deaths were
ruled accidental.

   Mushers in the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race traded rolling hills for the flat expanse of the
frozen Yukon River as they tried to catch 70-year-old Joe
Redington, who's led since Tuesday.
   Redington arrived at Ruby, a Yukon village 653 miles from the
race's start in Anchorage and the first checkpoint on the river, at
12:30 p.m. Friday and left six hours later.
   His closest rival, Martin Buser of Big Lake, pulled in at 5:05
p.m. In third was Herbie Nayokpuk of Shishmaref, who arrived in
Ruby at 6:20 p.m.
   Four-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers was
running fourth. He checked out of Cripple, 120 miles back, at 7:25
p.m. Thursday. Joe Garnie of Teller followed Swenson out at 8:45
p.m., and defending champion Susan Butcher of Manley left at 9:50
p.m.
   Jerry Austin of St. Michael, running in eighth place, said he
and several mushers near him are still strong contenders in a race
that won't reach the finish line in Nome until later next week.
   ``Don't write off anybody that's three or six hours off the pace
right now,'' he said in Cripple. ``We're just inching our way up.
We're steadily gaining on them.''
   Butcher noted that Redington and Nayokpuk took their mandatory
24-hour layovers early in the race, an advantage because the
leaders later got bogged down in new snow. But that advantage may
be wearing thin, she said.
   ``It was a break for them in the beginning, but now they've been
going with no real long rest for a while. I think our dogs are
fresher,'' she said.
   But Nayokpuk, who couldn't keep up with Redington between
Cripple and Ruby, said Butcher and Swenson may have trouble
catching Redington.
   ``I tried to travel with Joe Redington from Cripple, but he
disappeared in a hurry,'' a tired Nayokpuk said as he sat on the
porch of a house in Ruby and changed his boots. ``I never saw him
again. He has the dogs. If he gets those dogs running to Nome, he's
going to be a hard one to beat.''
   Redington is known as the Father of the Iditarod for helping
found the race 16 years ago.
   The race started March 5 in Anchorage. After Ruby, mushers race
146 miles downriver to the village of Kaltag, then cross to the
Bering Sea coast for a final dash to Nome.
   The winner will collect $30,000 of a $150,000 purse; the next 19
finishers will split the rest. Two of the 52 teams that started the
race have dropped out.

   Soviet mushers will compete for the
first time this winter in the 1,100-mile Iditarod sled dog race and
will get their training and equipment from three-time champion
Susan Butcher.
   Butcher is taking a crash course in Russian for the 1,100-mile
trek and provided dogs and sleds for the two Soviets, who arrive
Nov. 1 for four months of training with Butcher and her husband,
Dave Monson.
   ``They'll be using my dogs this year,'' she said Monday. ``In
subsequent races, they'll be bringing over their own.
   ``There's just not enough time to make a trained racing team out
of inexperienced racers. They know how to work dogs, but that's
quite different from racing. They're coming over with nothing but
their cold-weather gear.''
   In its 17 years, the Anchorage-to-Nome race has included mushers
from Japan, Italy, Norway and Australia, among other nations, but
none from the Soviet Union.
   Rosemary Phillips, Iditarod executive director, said the Soviets
also have agreed to help organize an invitational Alaska-Soviet
race in 1991. It would cover about 1,000 miles from Nome to the
Soviet port city of Anadyr.
   ``The Soviets are not familiar with sled dog racing as we know
it _ especially long-distance racing,'' Phillips said. ``They'll
train here, in Alaska, and then they'll return to train others.''
   One of the Soviets is Nicholai Yettiye, 25, a secondary school
physical education teacher and a member of an expedition that
traveled 1,000 miles last spring by sled dog and kayak from the
Soviet Far East to Alaska.
   The other is Alexander Reznyuk, 43, chairman of a regional
sports committee.
   Fifty-four mushers have signed up for the 1990 Iditarod,
scheduled to begin March 4 and pay out $275,000 in prize money.
   Butcher and Monson supplied a dog team for an Australian musher
in 1985 and for a Norwegian in 1986. The Norwegian, Rune
Hesthammer, came in 10th and was Rookie of the Year, Butcher said.
   Butcher has 130 dogs in her kennel, more than enough to go
around.

River to the Bering Sea Coast, setting up the final sprint to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
Runyan, a musher from Nenana, checked into this Norton Sound community just a 
minute ahead of Butcher. He logged in at 6:45 a.m. local time Monday, with the 
three-time champion in at 6:46 a.m., and Buser, from Big Lake, reporting in at

Butcher of Manley had left the Yukon River village of Kaltag at 6:55 p.m. 
Sunday, with Buser a minute behind her. Runyan, running 16 dogs to Butcher's 12 
and Buser's 11, pulled out at 7:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow, logging out at 9:13 p.m., four-time 
champion Rick Swenson of Manley, 9:14 p.m., and Lavon Barve of Wasilla leaving 
at 10:19 p.m.

The leaders -- Butcher, Buser, Runyan, Swenson, Barve and Jonrowe -- have been 
out front of the pack since they left the gold mining ghost town of Iditarod, 
558 miles into the race and its half-way point.

   When the first musher charges north in
the 16th annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Saturday,
organizers already will have their own victory, over Alaska's
economic bust and the race's $773,000 debt.
   Fifty-five mushers have signed up for the rugged 1,100-mile
contest billed as ``the Last Great Race on Earth.'' Last year, 63
teams signed up; the year before, 73.
   This year's field includes four-time champion Rick Swenson;
two-time winner Susan Butcher, whose $50,000 winner's check last
year bounced; 1983 champion Rick Mackey; and 16 rookies. Mushers
from Austria, Canada, France and Great Britain also have signed up.
   The race is named after the Iditarod Trail, an old gold rush and
mail route to Nome. This year's race takes mushers over the tougher
northern route, where temperatures, although moderate of late, can
reach minus 50 degrees.
   Starting in downtown Anchorage on trucked-in snow, racers must
cross over the Alaska Range, traverse frozen tundra and climb the
timbered Kuskokwim Mountains to reach the Yukon River at Ruby, an
old gold mining community.
   The mushers trek south on the Yukon and turn toward the coast at
Kaltag. At Unalakleet, the teams turn north and run along the
windblown coast and sea ice to Nome's Front Street.
   The trail became part of Alaska's legends in 1925, when 20
mushers pushed for 127{ hours to relay diphtheria serum 674 miles
from Nenana to Nome to save the city from an epidemic.
   After the check issued Butcher bounced, a special audit in April
found the race was $773,000 in debt, said Rosemary Phillips, the
race's executive director.
   ``I suppose the economy had a lot to do with it,'' she said.
``The Iditarod was caught up in the collapse. More was spent than
was taken in.''
   Oil prices peaked at about $30 a barrel in 1985 but plunged to
less than $10 by July 1986. About 85 percent of the state's
revenues come from royalties and taxes paid by the oil industry.
When oil prices fell, the state's economy, heavily dependent on
state expenditures, went into the abyss.
   Bankruptcies and foreclosures soared. Property values tumbled,
jobs dried up and businesses closed, but the Iditarod, which relies
on private contributions, did not get the message.
   ``We had a hard time seeing our problem,'' said Iditarod Trail
Committee President Lavon Barve. ``There was a budget, and the
money was spent for that budget, but the money didn't come in.''
   Joe Redington, an Iditarod board member and race founder, said
the race was spending money for things it did not need. ``We spent
a lot of money and didn't pay no bills,'' he said. ``It was spent
unwisely. We had too many employees. We had top salaries and all
the benefits. We had better insurance than General Motors.''
   When the race's financial problems became known, officials cut
the staff by two-thirds. ``We had 34 to start with. The rest took
pay cuts. We cut all benefits,'' Phillips said.
   Joanne Potts, race coordinator since 1983, said about 700
volunteers, such as pilots and ham radio operators, worked for the
race last year. She expected about 1,200 this year.
   While cutting expenses, the race also has found new sponsors. A
footwear manufacturer's four-year sponsorship could bring in more
than $500,000, Phillips said. A dog food manufacturer agreed to a
one-year contract worth more than $25,000. A television network has
offered $15,000 for coverage rights.
   Merchandising the Iditarod name on everything from beer steins
to buttons makes up as much as 40 percent of the race's revenues,
she said.
   ``As of right now, our outstanding debts are about $220,000. I
think it's fantastic,'' Phillips said. This year's purse will be at
least $125,000, still the largest purse in sled dog racing, she
said.
   Potts said she never doubted the race would continue.
   ``There were people last June who didn't think we were going to
have a race this year,'' she said. ``We fooled them. We're going to
have one. It's just bigger than all the little problems we had last
year.''

   The 70-year-old founder of the Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race surrendered the lead Saturday after setting the
pace for more than 400 miles, and the leaders raced down the frozen
Yukon River.
   Joe Redington lost the lead to Martin Buser, who left Galena
with his dogs about an hour ahead of Redington. They were still
about an hour apart when they reached Nulato, 52 miles downstream
and 400 miles from the finish in Nome.
   The race started in Anchorage on March 5. The first musher to
Nome will collect $30,000 of a $150,000 purse; the next 19
finishers will split the rest. Three of the 52 teams that started
the race have dropped out, including one Saturday.
   Redington, who founded the race in 1973, has never won, although
he has competed in all but two Iditarods.
   Redington had a 4{-hour lead when he left Ruby on Friday evening
but Buser, who moved to Alaska from Switzerland in 1979, made up
time during the night. Redington dropped one dog in Galena, leaving
him with just nine. Buser also dropped one, but still had 14 in
harness.
   ``I tried to travel with Joe Redington from Cripple, but he
disappeared in a hurry,'' said veteran Herbie Nayokpuk. ``I never
saw him again. He has the dogs. If he gets those dogs running to
Nome, he's going to be a hard one to beat.''
   Rick Swenson of Two Rivers and Susan Butcher of Manley, the only
mushers ever to win the marathon race more than once, arrived in
Galena about an hour before Buser left. Swenson, a four-time
winner, and Butcher, who won the last two races in record time,
each had 13 dogs.
   Nayokpuk, who had been near the lead throughout, checked in at
Galena at midmorning, and by afternoon, 10 mushers had reached
there.
   ``Don't write off anybody that's three or six hours off the pace
right now,'' said one of them, Jerry Austin of St. Michael. ``We're
just inching our way up. We're steadily gaining on them.''
   Jacques Philip, of Thomery, France, led the foreign mushers in
15th place. Horst Maas, of Lenz, Austria, was in 25th; Peter
Thomann of Tagish in Canada's Yukon Territory, was 31st; Ian
Mackenzie of Bruce Mines, Ontario, 41st; Brian Carver of Melbourne,
Australia, 46th; and Lesley Anne Monk of Worsthorne, England, 48th.
   American mushers from outside Alaska were paced by Robin
Jacobson of Minnetonka, Minn., in 19th place. John Patten of Grand
Marais, Minn., was 27th; Frank Teasley, Jackson, Wyo., 28th; Terry
Adkins, Mikado, Mich., 29th; Dan McEachen, Snowmass Village, Colo.,
32nd; and Stan Ferguson, Philadelphia, 47th.

   Throngs crowding a downtown street
covered with trucked-in snow cheered Saturday as 49 mushers and
hundreds of dogs charged off on the first leg of the 1,168-mile
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome.
   The 17th annual race over the Alaska Range, across desolate
stretches and along the storm-raked coast began in clear, windy
weather at 9 a.m., with veteran musher Jerry Austin of St. Michael
first out of the chute.
   Susan Butcher, aiming for her fourth consecutive win and the
$50,000 winner's share of the $250,000 purse, was 19th to leave in
the succession of departures spaced two minutes apart. Rival Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers, the only person to win the race four times,
was No. 22.
   ``I feel great! I feel great!'' Butcher, 33, of Manley said with
a laugh as she hugged a well-wisher before the start of her 12th
Iditarod. Last year, she finished in just under 11 days and 12 hours.
   ``I think that I can take the pressure,'' she said. ``I know that
everybody's gunning for me, I know that everybody's after me, but I
don't see how they can be more after me than they were last year.''
   A temperature of 13 degrees and winds gusting to 46 mph combined
for a wind chill of minus 22 degrees at the race's start. Stronger
wind and clear skies were reported along the first stretch of the
race route.
   The snow was trucked in because the streets had been swept.
   Some observers crowded into a fast-food restaurant to stay warm
while awaiting the start. Children outside hawked Iditarod
newspapers and a man wearing a sandwich sign advertised Iditarod
photographs.
   The race, inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to Nome for a
diptheria outbreak in 1925, began in 1973.
   The number of competitors dropped this year in part because the
record cold spell of January and February prevented mushers from
giving their dogs enough training, said race manager Jack Niggemyer.
There were 53 competitors last year.
   The racers will stop at 25 checkpoints along the route, where
they will get food for themselves and their dogs. Along the way,
they will camp out or stay in homes or lodges.
   Commercial subsidies for the race have grown substantially over
the years, with money coming from a variety of sources, including
television rights, dog-food companies and manufacturers of
cold-weather gear.
   Joe Redington, the 72-year-old ``Father of the Iditarod,'' stood
by his dogs early Saturday as he waited to compete for the 15th time.
   ``I'm a little more serious this year than I have been before,''
said Redington, who has never won the race. ``I usually go out and
have a good time. I'll be a little more serious now.''
   Libby Riddles, whose 1985 victory made her the first woman to win
the Iditarod, is back after missing two of the last three races and
dropping out of a third.
   ``I'm just real anxious to get on the trail,'' said Riddles, 32 ,
of Nome. ``I feel prepared for anything.''

   Seventy-year-old Joe Redington dashed out
of this checkpoint Wednesday in the 1,150-mile Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race, declaring, ``I feel like an old fox being chased by 50
young hounds.''
   The second-oldest racer in the Anchorage-to Nome mushing
marathon left this Kuskokwim River town after staying about four
hours to feed and rest his 14 dogs.
   Known as the Father of the Iditarod, the Wasilla resident helped
create the race 16 years ago but has never won, even though he has
competed nearly every year.
   Redington arrived in McGrath, 410 miles into the race, at 6:48
a.m. He was followed by Herbie Nayokpuk of Shishmaref at 10:26 a.m.
Behind them, in order, were Jan Masek of Anchorage and Joe Garnie
of Teller.
   Two other mushers _ Joe Runyan of Nenana and Ralph ``Babe''
Anderson of McGrath _ also arrived in the morning but were not
among the leaders because they had not yet taken their mandatory
24-hour layovers.
   Redington, Nayokpuk and Garnie took their layovers early in the
race, which began Saturday. That turned out to be a successful
strategy, because a pack of about 20 leading mushers later bogged
down in new snow. As those mushers took their 24-hour layover in
Rohn, they watched helplessly as Redington, Nayokpuk and Garnie
sailed past on the smooth trail they had packed.
   One of those was the defending champion, Susan Butcher of
Manley, who was in fifth place.
   Some racers said that despite Redington's lead, Nayokpuk is now
the musher to beat because his dogs are stronger.
   ``I think it's going to take us quite a while to gain that kind
of time back, unless he runs into some kind of situation up
ahead,'' four-time Iditarod champion Rick Swenson said in Rohn.
   Meanwhile, at the back of the pack, Norman Vaughan announced
Wednesday that he was dropping out. Vaughan, at 82 the oldest
Iditarod musher, was the only one left at the Puntilla Lake
checkpoint, 290 miles behind the leaders. Another musher also
dropped out, leaving the number of competitors at 50.
   A $30,000 first prize awaits the winner in Nome, with the rest
of the $150,000 purse to be split among the next 19 finishers.

   Greeted by sirens and shouts, Susan Butcher
stormed into this Gold Rush town Wednesday in sub-zero weather and
record time to rack up her fourth victory in five years in the
1,158 mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher, 33, of Manley, became only the second four-time winner
of the 18-year-old Anchorage-to-Nome marathon.
   Butcher was running about two hours ahead of defending champion
Joe Runyan of Nenana, a reversal of positions from the 1989 finish.
   Runyan won that race with a one-hour, five-minute cushion over
Butcher.
   Butcher finished with 11 dogs. During her 11 days on the trail
she had to drop three veteran dogs that pulled her to her previous
victories. She credited her unknown canines for the victory.
   ``This team has been absolutely incredible,'' Butcher said.
``I've never had a team go as strong as this.
   ``I don't know what's in that team that could do it, but it must
be the combination working together. There's been no strong dog
emerge from this group.''
   Her official time was 11 days, 1 hour, 53 minutes and 23
seconds. That is an all-time record, beating by more than 10
minutes her 1987 mark of 11 days, 2 hours and 5 minutes, which was
set on another route.
   The previous record for the northern route _ also set by Butcher
in 1986 _ was 11 days, 15 hours and 6 minutes.
   Butcher said it was extraordinary to break the record on the
slightly longer northern route.
   ``This team had power coming out of its ears,'' she said. ``Not
so much charging up hills, but stamina. It just had it.''
   She wins $50,000 in first-place money plus $25,000 from Purina
Pro Plan, one of her sponsors.
   The rest of the $200,000 purse will be split among the next 19
finishers.
   The record time came as a surprise this year. The 70 mushers who
began the race March 3 had to contend with the deepest snow in a
quarter-century, ash from Redoubt Volcano, some unseasonably warm
days that tired their dogs, buffalo on the trail and marauding
moose.
   Forced to forage in shoulder-deep snow, moose are especially
aggressive this winter. At least two mushers had run-ins with the
huge animals, with tangled their lines and stomped their dogs.
   The only other four-time winner is Rick Swenson, who was leading
out of McGrath near the halfway point. Swenson, of Trapper Creek,
had to turn back and have his team checked by a veterinarian after
one such encounter.
   That cost him the race. Swenson was running in sixth place
Wednesday.
   People emptied out of bars and stores as Butcher headed down
Front Street to cross under the large burl sign that symbolizes the
finish line.
   Nome's populaton of 3,000 roughly doubles during the Iditarod as
the community is host of an amateur basketball tournament involving
53 teams from more than a dozen villages in northern and western
Alaska.
   In addition to her four victories, Butcher has finished second
three times, and among the top 10 four other times.
   The only other woman to win the grueling race, Libby Riddles of
Nome, watched the finish on sunny streets in minus 10-degree
temperatures.
   ``She outraced these guys. She maintained her dog team better,''
Riddles said. ``You make your luck.''
   The Iditarod, named after an old supply route to the gold mining
districts of interior Alaska, draws its inspiration from a 1925
relay of diptheria serum from Nenana to Nome, which was hit hard by
an outbreak of the disease.
   Butcher began 68th of 70 mushers, but moved into the lead just
after the halfway point, and alternated with Runyan and Lavon Barve
of Wasilla as the teams reached the windblown Bering Sea coast near
the end.
   Breaking away from Runyan and Barve, she took the lead for good
Monday in the treacherous night-time crossing of 30 miles of ice
covering Norton Bay.
   Seven teams dropped out, and one team was disqualified.
   The remaining teams were strung out 600 miles back and will be
straggling into Nome for a week or more.

   Susan Butcher, bundled against biting winds
and subzero temperatures, widened her lead and seemed assured of an
unprecedented third straight victory in the 1,150-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher, who left this checkpoint just as her closest competitor
arrived Tuesday, was expected to cross the finish line in Nome
today.
   If Butcher wins, it will be the fourth consecutive year that a
woman has won the 16-year-old race. Libby Riddles of Teller won in
1985, and Butcher won in 1986 and 1987, setting a course record
each year.
   Butcher left Elim, 123 miles from Nome, at 5:11 p.m. Tuesday,
after stopping in the Eskimo village for two hours to feed and rest
her dog team. Martin Buser of Big Lake arrived two minutes before
she left.
   Butcher, a resident of Manley, took the lead early Tuesday and
has not yielded it. She left Elim with 10 of the 17 dogs she
started with March 5 in Anchorage; the others were dropped at
checkpoints along the trail.
   Buser was traveling with 12 of his original 20 dogs still in
harness.
   Subzero temperatures and biting winds continued to hinder the
leaders, and weather forecasters said the wind chill factor could
sink to minus 70 degrees along the trail's final miles.
   In each of her two previous victories, Butcher proved the
strength and endurance of her team in the final, windswept miles
along the barren Bering Sea coast. Her elapsed time last year was
11 days, 2 hours.
   Her closest rival last year was four-time Iditarod champion Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers, who ran neck-and-neck with Butcher until his
dogs refused to continue just 22 miles from the finish.
   This year, Swenson was about six hours behind Butcher at last
report, leaving Koyuk at 2 p.m. Tuesday in third place. Running in
fourth was Joe Garnie of Teller.
   Herbie Nayokpuk of Shishmaref was fifth. Seventy-year-old Joe
Redington of Knik, who took an early lead and held it for more than
400 miles, was sixth.
   Redington, known as the ``Father of the Iditarod'' for
organizing the first race in 1973, has run all but two races and
placed as high as fifth, but has yet to win.
   The first musher to Nome collects $30,000 of a $150,000 purse;
the next 19 finishers split the rest. Five of the 52 teams that
started the race have dropped out.

   Fighting warm temperatures and wet
snow, the leaders in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race were out of
Finger Lake and on their way to Rainy Pass early today.
   Thirteen teams left the Finger Lake checkpoint, 193 miles from
the 1,158-mile race's starting line, in one hour late Sunday.
Twenty-three other teams had arrived at the checkpoint.
   Lavon Barve of Wasilla and Jerry Austin of St. Michael pulled
out at 7:39 p.m. They were followed by DeeDee Jonrowe of Bethel,
1987 champion Susan Butcher of Manley, four-time champion Rick
Swenson of Two Rivers and Tim Moerlein of Kasilof.
   Barve and Swenson had declared their 24-hour layovers, then
canceled the layover. All mushers are required to halt for one full
24 hour period during the race to rest themselves and their dogs.
   Temperatures in the Rainy Pass area were in the high 20s early
today, the National Weather Service reported. Temperatures that
hovered around 32 degrees on Saturday took a toll on many of the
sled dogs, which are accustomed to running in much colder weather.
   Herbie Nayokpuk was 18th into Skwentna, a checkpoint 148 miles
from Anchorage, and notified officials he would take the race's
mandatory 24-hour layover in Skwentna.
   ``I've got to save some of my dogs,'' he said. ``I almost burned
them up. I'll have to rest them a little bit.''
   When the lead mushers reach Puntilla Lake in Rainy Pass, they
will have covered 223 miles of the 1,158-mile race.
   Fifty-two teams started the race early Saturday. Defending
champion Butcher finished last year's race in a record 11 days, two
hours.
   The race is inspired by a 1925 dog sled relay that rushed
diphtheria serum to Nome during an outbreak of the disease. The top
20 mushers will split a purse of $150,000. The winner will get
$30,000.
   U.S. mushers from outside Alaska, and their positions: Frank
Teasley of Jackson, Wyo., was 15th; Terry Adkins of Mikado, Mich.,
was 21st; Robin Jacobson of Minnetonka, Minn., was 27th; Dan
MacEachen of Snowmass Village, Colo., was 29th; John Patten of
Grand Marais, Minn., was 35st; and Stan Ferguson of Philadelphia
was 41th.

   Sirens wailed and hundreds of boisterous
fans jammed the street to cheer Susan Butcher as she coasted to an
unprecedented third straight victory in the 1,150-mile Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Bitterly cold winds raked Nome as the flushed and perspiring
33-year-old Alaskan cruised beneath the log-arch finish at 8:42
p.m. Wednesday.
   ``It means a lot to me to win three years in a row,'' said a
smiling Butcher, the only musher to win three consecutive
Iditarods, as she hugged her frosty-faced lead dogs, Granite and
Tolstoy.
   ``I very much want four,'' said Butcher, who has competed in 11
of the grueling races and earned $30,000 for Wednesday's victory.
``I guess I want five.''
   Although the weather ``was pretty nasty,'' Butcher said this
morning, it was to her advantage ``because my dogs are good in that
type of conditions.''
   Butcher, who appeared with Granite on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America,'' said the dog ``came through with flying colors. He's got
to get a good bone for this one.''
   Butcher finished after 11 days, 11 hours, and 41 minutes, a
record for the race's longer northern route from Anchorage to Nome.
Last year, her time of 11 days, 2 hours set a record for the
shorter southern route.
   Her closest rival, Martin Buser of Big Lake, trailed by 14 hours
Wednesday night.
   ``What gave me the jump on Martin was that storm we had last
night,'' Butcher said. ``I knew, when I heard we were going to have
winds, that was the best thing that could happen, because I knew
mine would pull through it.''
   Buser's team, she said, had balked in light winds earlier along
the coast. ``So I knew he couldn't make it through a storm,'' she
said. Wind and cold dropped the wind chill to minus 70 degrees.
   She said Buser, battling for second place with four-time
Iditarod champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, will be a strong
contender if he races next year.
   Joe Garnie of Teller was running fourth Wednesday. Joe
Redington, a 70-year-old Knik resident known as ``the father of the
Iditarod'' for helping in 1973 to found the race he has never won,
was fifth.
   After the winner's take, the next 19 finishers will split
$120,000 in prize money.
   People emptied out of bars and at least one church as Butcher
headed into this old gold-mining town, a regional hub for western
Alaska whose population roughly doubled in recent days because of
the race.
   Butcher has won the Iditarod three times, finished second twice,
and finished among the top 10 four other times. She is the second
woman to win the Iditarod. Libby Riddles of Teller won the contest
in 1985, the year Butcher was forced to drop out after an angry
moose stomped through her team.
   The Iditarod, named after an old supply route to the gold mining
districts of interior Alaska, draws its inspiration from a 1925
relay of diphtheria serum to Nome, which was hit hard by an
outbreak of the disease.
   The race started March 5 on trucked-in snow in downtown
Anchorage, and the temperature fluctuated around freezing the next
few days, which strained the cold-loving huskies. Then, fresh snow
slowed the leaders in the Alaska Range.
   Redington, who has entered all but two of the race's 16
runnings, has placed as high as fifth. For 400 miles, it seemed as
if he might finally win, but he lost the lead to Buser on the
frozen Yukon River.
   As the race reached the windblown Bering Sea coast, Butcher
quickly caught up. She passed Buser on Tuesday near Koyuk, 171
miles from the finish.
   Five of the 52 teams that started the race have dropped out. The
remaining teams were strung 500 miles back along the trail and will
be straggling into Nome for a week or more.

   Joe Redington couldn't run in the first
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 1973 because he was too busy
organizing the 1,100-mile marathon from Anchorage to Nome.
   He missed out again in 1983 when a run-in with an angry moose
during training left him with a few cracked ribs.
   But Redington, now 70, has run in every other Iditarod, a
torturous test of people and dogs billed as ``The Last Great
Race.'' And as this year's race approached the midpoint near the
frozen Yukon River, Redington was savoring the lead in a contest he
has never won.
   Redington, who has finished as high as fifth three times,
grabbed the lead Tuesday at Rohn, 271 miles from the start, and
held it until Saturday when he slipped into second place at the
Yukon River town of Galena, 452 miles from the finish.
   ``I feel like an old fox being chased by 50 young hounds,'' he
said.
   Redington earned the title ``Father of the Iditarod'' 16 years
ago when he spearheaded a movement to get Alaskans off snowmobiles
and back behind the dog teams that traditionally had provided
winter transportation across the vast state.
   To galvanize the mushing revival, he promoted an idea that many
thought impossible _ a race along the old Iditarod Trail, a supply
route used earlier this century to reach interior Alaska gold
mining districts.
   In 1925, dog teams relayed diphtheria serum along the trail to
the epidemic-stricken community of Nome on Norton Sound.
   Using that historic relay for inspiration, 36 wary mushers set
out from Anchorage in March 1973. For the next month, the dog teams
struggled up into the glacier-ribbed Alaska Range, dropped into the
timbered interior, mushed down the frozen Yukon, then crossed over
to the wind-blown Bering Sea coast for a final limp into Nome.
   It was a macho event full of the Alaska mystique, and the men
who finished _ no women raced until 1975 _ were instant heroes in
Alaska.
   Today, the race still bursts with a frontier aura. Rugged
mushers and their teams of 12 to 20 eager dogs brave blizzards,
wild animals, frostbite and 1,000 miles of sled-busting trail.
   But it's not quite so macho anymore.
   Since 1985, when Libby Riddles ventured into a howling gale and
left the men behind, women have dominated the race.
   Riddles won that race, and Susan Butcher has won the last two,
setting a course record each time. Last March, she finished in 11
days, 2 hours, about half the time it took in 1973.
   The fastest competitors have become mushing machines. Backed by
corporate sponsors and driving high-tech plastic sleds, they shave
hours from their race times by going without sleep for days. The
winner this year will get $30,000; the next 19 finishers will share
the rest of the $150,000 purse.
   But even some of the leaders refuse to take things too seriously.
   Duane ``Dewey'' Halverson, a perennial contender, remembers the
days when many mushers regarded the Iditarod as an extended camping
trip.
   ``I think the competition is a little stiffer than it used to
be,'' he said in McGrath while his dogs rested on straw laid down
in the snow.
   ``We'll make it and have fun and see where we finish, and I'll
get one of those little teeny trophies this year.''
   Then he grinned and pronounced his own philosophy of racing dogs
across the Alaska wilds:
   ``I'm going to have fun if it kills me.''

   Workers strung a finish-line banner above Front
Street and installed wiring for TV crews as leaders in the Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race pressed toward Nome.
   ``There is no month of March in Nome,'' said Howard Farley, the
finish coordinator who competed in the first race in 1973. ``It's
the month of Iditarod.''
   The annual 1,168-mile race brings excitement, attention and money
to this town of 4,300 people, and residents have been readying for
the onslaught of mushers, spectators and news teams since
competitors left Anchorage March 4.
   Susan Butcher, who has won the race the last three years, today
struggled to hold off Joe Runyan and Rick Swenson after regaining
the lead from Runyan late Monday.
   ``My dogs love it; they're getting stronger all the time,''
Butcher said in Kouyk, 171 miles from the finish line. She arrived
31 minutes ahead of Runyan but left with only a nine-minute lead.
Swenson left Koyuk 53 minutes behind Butcher.
   Barring a change in the calm weather that mushers have enjoyed
since the race began March 4, the winner should reach Nome sometime
early Wednesday _ perhaps in time to beat Butcher's record of
slightly more than 11 days.
   The progress has been charted by the community's two radio
stations, both of which sent reporters on the trail.
   ``We tend to go into overdrive about a week before the race
starts,'' said Tom Busch, manager of KNOM and a member of the
Iditarod Trail Committee's board of directors.
   Other workers have been busy with chores such as getting
permission to use the Volunteer Fire Department's Christmas lights
and testing the municipal siren that heralds the arrival of each
musher.
   ``Everybody's a hero when he finishes the Iditarod race here in
Nome,'' Farley said.
   Most of the work is carried out by volunteers, although inmates
from the Anvil Mountain Correctional Center have helped install the
sled chute at the finish, City manager Polly Prchal said.
   ``It's a very appreciated, welcome and needed break for us,''
said Patti James, operator of a downtown stoe. ``With the arrival of
the Iditarod and the Iditarod Basketball Tournament, the mood picks
up and the economy surges,'' she said.
   Tourism officials estimate the two events bring 2,000 people to
Nome.
   The city's two hotels and bed-and-breakfast facilities are
booked. Poeple who arrive without lodging are advised to check homes
where sleeping-bag space and the use of a bathroom cost $25 a night.
   ``We never turn people away,'' Farley said. ``If people ever get
the idea that we don't have room, they won't come up.''

<TEXT>
   Three-time Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race
winner Susan Butcher is shooting for a fourth victory next year,
saying she can whittle a day off her record time to cover the 1,150
mile-course in just 10 days.
   ``I think it can be done, and I want to be the one to do it,''
she said.
   Butcher left her nearest competitor miles behind on the
windblown Bering Sea coast Wednesday night to breeze into the
record books with her third straight victory.
   The 33-year-old musher charged down Front Street in this old
gold mining town at 8:42 p.m. (AST) Wednesday. She covered the
storm-wracked course from Anchorage to Nome in 11 days, 11 hours,
and 41 minutes.
   Her elapsed time _ the actual time on the course minus the time
spent on mandatory breaks _ set a record for the race's longer,
more arduous northern route. She broke her own record set in 1986.
And last year she set the record for the southern route.
   ``It means a lot to me to win three years in a row,'' said the
flushed and perspiring musher. ``But the win doesn't mean as much
to me as knowing the dogs were able to do it.''
   Race officials presented her dog team's leaders, Granite and
Tolstoy, with wreaths of plastic yellow roses. They said real roses
would have wilted quickly in the 10-degree temperature fanned by
30-mph winds.
   The dogs, ice hanging from their muzzles, appeared perplexed by
the glaring television lights and the press of the crowd chanting
``Susan, Susan.''
   She was met by her husband, Dave Monson, who won the 1,000-mile
Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race earlier this month.
   Butcher received $30,000 for winning, down from last year's top
prize of $50,000. The financial problems of the race committee
during the past year caused her winning check last year to bounce,
although she eventually collected all her money.
   Butcher held an unthreatened lead since Tuesday, when she blew
by Martin Buser 171 miles from Nome.
   She said she would be back for the 17th annual Iditarod next
year, but added she might give up the 200- and 300-mile
intermediate races she ran this year.
   ``It's been a long year,'' she said.
   Only one other musher, Rick Swenson, has ever won the race four
times. Butcher and Swenson are the only ones in 16 years ever to
win more than once.

<TEXT>     Attention centers on four contests.;    Two of the most prestigious and
accessible races start in mountain-and-sea-ringed Anchorage: the World
Championship Sled Dog Race (this weekend during the Fur Rendezvous or "Rondy,"
as Alaskans call it); and the world-famous Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race
(starting March 2 at 9 a.m.), a grueling 1,150-miler to Nome. The two events
attract 50,000 spectators.;    Fairbanks hosts two other sled dog contests,
the finish of the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race (March
8-11), which starts Feb. 24 in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada; and the
Alascom Open North American Championship Sled Dog Race (March 15-17 during the
annual Winter Carnival).;    Mushers get addicted to hanging on for dear life
as a team of 45-pound dogs streaks down streets lined with noisy onlookers or
through silent woods and around corners with only a "gee" or a "haw" to guide
them. Crowds love the excitement of photo finishes such as 1978's Iditarod,
when Dick Mackey came into Nome only one second ahead of Rich Swenson after 14
days, 18 hours, 52 minutes and 24 seconds on the trail.;    Fur Rendezvous; 
It was not the thrill of a photo finish that motivated organizers of the first
Fur Rendezvous in 1936. Back then, it was merely a cure for Alaskans' cabin
fever and, in addition to the fur auction, consisted only of a festival queen,
four or five sports events and a one-dog children's sled race. But in 1946,
Earl Norris, a Siberian husky breeder, had an adult open-class sled dog race
added. Only three teams entered, so they split the $170 purse three ways.;   
Since then the Rondy has grown, and this year, a small staff of paid workers
and about 5,000 volunteers put on a world-class, million-dollar celebration
and fur auction with 150 events.;    The World Championship Sled Dog Race is
one of three dog races run during the Rondy. It combines times of three
successive 25-mile heats for a $50,000 purse.;    Iditarod;  Trail manager
Jack Niggemyer says of the 4-foot-wide, 1,150-mile-long Iditarod Trail that
"it's my job to lay it down and maintain it with no sharp corners and no holes
in the ice.";    For "outsiders" -- what Alaskans call everybody else -- the
designated "Last Great Race on Earth" from Anchorage to Nome has become the
most prestigious and fascinating distance sled dog race in the world.;    It's
a far cry from 1964, when Wasilla, Alaska, historian Dorothy Page suggested
opening the old mail and supply route from Knik to Nome -- via the interior
towns of Flat, Ophir and Iditarod -- to mark the 100th anniversary of the
Alaska purchase from Russia in 1867. Page was asked a good question: Why would
anyone support an unknown race over a trail overgrown and unused for 50 years
through a town (Iditarod) that wasn't there anymore?;    Nonetheless, by the
centennial year, 1967, nine miles of trail had been opened from Knik to Big
Lake for the first Iditarod race. Fifty-eight mushers competed for a $25,000
purse, the largest in Alaska up to that time.;    It wasn't until 1973 that
the first Anchorage-to-Nome Iditarod race was run. Dick Wilmarth took 20 days
to beat 33 other mushers for his share of the $50,000 purse.;    Since then
the race time has been gradually whittled. Last year, Susan Butcher beat her
own 1987 record with a time of about 11 days and 1 hour to become the second
four-time winner in the Iditarod's history.;    The race runs south through
Iditarod in odd-numbered years and north through Ruby and Galena in
even-numbered years. Teams cross mountain ranges, frozen rivers and dense
forests, desolate tundra and miles of windswept coast on the Bering Sea.;   
The $250,000 purse awards $50,000 to first place and lesser amounts to the
next 19 finishers. Finishers from 20th on get $1,000 each. The entry fee is
$1,249, and close to 60 teams enter.;    Yukon Quest;  In seven years, the
Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race has earned a reputation as the
toughest race in the north. Fierce winds, steep summits, long distances
between checkpoints and a wilderness trail indistinct and easy to lose under
blizzardy drifts challenge the contestants. Mushers are required to take a
36-hour rest midway along the trail at Dawson.;    The quest, which runs from
Whitehorse to Fairbanks in odd-numbered years, got started because of the high
cost of running in the Iditarod. In 1984, 24 mushers competed for a $50,000
purse. Sonny Linder won in 12 days and 5 minutes and collected $15,000.;   
The race costs $650 to enter and is limited to 50 teams of 8-12 dogs so
smaller kennels can enter.;    Now, the $75,000 purse pays $20,000 to first
place and cash to the next 14 finishers. In 1990, Vern Halter's winning time
was 11 days, 17 hours and 9 minutes.;    The quest attracts mushers who laugh
at adversity. In 1989, the race achieved new infamy. Seven leader teams broke
through the Yukon River ice in 60 degrees below zero weather and were dubbed
the Yukon Quest Swim Team.;    Alascom Open;  The days will be longer March
15-17 for the Alascom Open North American Championship in Fairbanks. The
62-year-old speed race starts in town, drops down onto the frozen Chena River
and then loops north back to the starting line. The purse is $46,000, and
heats of 20, 20 and 30 miles run on successive days.;  If you go . . .;   
(check) Weather -- High temperatures in Fairbanks average minus 4 degrees in
February and 8.4 degrees in March, and in Anchorage 26 degrees in February and
34 degrees in March. Wear layers of clothing: longsleeve shirts, sweaters and
a winter coat, plus warm boots and gloves.;    (check) GETTING THERE --
Anchorage is served by 17 airlines with about 100 flights daily; Fairbanks has
direct flights from Seattle and Anchorage; Nome is served by Alaska Airlines
and several regional carriers and also is accessible by helicopter. You can
get to Whitehorse for the start of the Yukon Quest by car on the Alaska
Highway or by plane.;    (check) LODGING -- Anchorage has 5,500 rooms and
Fairbanks 1,000; Whitehorse has 373 rooms and Nome 144. Many hotels offer
reduced winter rates.;    (check) ACTIVITIES -- The Nome Convention and

   Lavon Barve won $3,000 in silver ingots
and the halfway trophy at this wilderness checkpoint, more than a
half-hour ahead of defending champion Joe Runyan in the 18th annual
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Barve arrived at the official halfway checkpoint at 10:57 p.m.
   Runyan was followed by three-time winner Susan Butcher, Dee Dee
Jonrowe, Robin Jacobson, Martin Buser, Rick Swenson, the Iditarod's
only four-time champion, and Tim Osmar.
   Seventy teams left Anchorage last Saturday to compete in the
1,160-mile endurance run across mountains, wind-swept rivers,
Arctic Ocean ice and treeless tundra.
   The silver ingots awarded the first musher to reach the official
halfway point have become something of a jinx. Only once since the
race was organized in 1973 has the winner of the halfway money held
on to win the race.
   The Iditarod, named for a tiny ghost town along the route,
commemorates the 1925 emergency delivery by dog teams of
life-saving diphtheria serum to Nome.
   The race in past years has taken from 11 to 18 days to complete.

   Three-time winner Susan Butcher pushed into
the lead of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race again today during the
treacherous crossing of ice-covered Norton Sound on the Bering Sea.
   And after a short rest she and her team took off on the final
171 miles of the 11,058-mile race from Anchorage to Nome.
   Race observers expect the winner to reach Nome on Wednesday
evening. Of the 70 teams that began the race in Anchorage on March
3, seven have scratched and another was disqualified because of
sick dogs.
   Butcher left the Shaktoolik checkpoint late Monday eight minutes
behind defending champion Joe Runyan, but had passed him by the end
of the nighttime 30-mile ice crossing today and had built a
55-minute lead.
   The mushers head out onto the ice of Norton Sound trying to save
time and miles, but it is one of the most dangerous segments of the
race. Open water leads in the ice can force time-consuming detours,
or swallow an unwary team.
   ``Once they get onto the (Bering Sea) ice, they can expect
sudden storms and an ample supply of wind,'' Gail Somerville, an
Iditarod spokeswoman in Anchorage, said Monday night.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the trail, the
Iditarod was started in 1973 to commemorate the 1925 emergency
delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from Anchorage to Nome by
sled dog teams.
   The winner will get $50,000 and the rest of a $200,000 purse
will be split among the next 19 finishers.
