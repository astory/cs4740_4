<HEAD>Tsutsumi Tops Forbes Billionaires List Third Straight Year</HEAD>

   Six of the 10 richest people in the world are
Japanese but the United States still leads the world in the total
number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes
magazine.
   For the third year running, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list of
private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much as
it had been 12 months earlier.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net
worth of at least $15 billion, over $3 billion less than estimated
last summer due mainly to a rise in the dollar against other major
currencies, Forbes said Sunday.
   The estimate was far greater than that made by Fortune magazine
in its September 1988 ranking of those it considered the world's
richest people _ which valued Tsutsumi's holdings at a mere $2.8
billion.
   In last year's list, Forbes estimated Tsutsumi's net worth was
$18.9 billion.
   The magazine reports in its July 24 issue that Tsutsumi edged out
second-ranked Taikichiro Mori by less than $1 billion.
   Mori, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings
in Tokyo, has an estimated net worth of $14.2 billion. In last
year's survey, Forbes placed Mori's worth at about $18 billion.
   The third-richest on the list was American Sam Moore Walton,
founder of the third largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. Walton and his family are worth an estimated $8.7
billion, up from Forbes' 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.
   After the Waltons came Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of the
Olympia &amp; York real estate empire, with a combined net worth of
about $8 billion.
   The rest of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and
industries, according to Forbes, were: Shin Kyuk-ho, South Korea,
candy, real estate; Hirotomo Takei and family, Japan, publishing,
real estate; Kitaro Watanabe, Japan, real estate, hotels; Haruhiko
Yoshimoto and family, Japan, real estate; Hans and Gad Rausing,
Sweden, liquids packaging; and Eitaro Itoyama, Japan, land.
   Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the
world with personal assets worth over $1 billion.
   The United States was the country with the most billionaires,
with 55 individuals qualifying for that title. Japan ranked second,
with 41, and West Germany was third with 20.
   American also accounted for the most billionaires in the 1988
survey, with 47 individuals, followed by Japan's 32 and West
Germany's 16.
   Among the richest of the world's rich were people who didn't
necessarily come by their money in an honest way.
   Colombia's cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away
piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit
margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years.
   Three of them made Forbes ``World Billionaires'' list including
Pablo Escobar Gaviria, leader of the notorious Medellin cocaine
cartel, with an estimated personal net worth of $3 billion. The
other cocaine kingpins on the list were the Ochoa family, worth more
than $2 billion, and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, with more than $1
billion.
   In compiling its list, Forbes does not consider royal families
and heads of state in compiling its list of wealthy people and
individuals ``because their wealth derives more from political
heritage than from economic effort _ theirs are feudal fortunes, not
capitalistic ones.''
   The magazine also excludes dictators, such as Cuba's Fidel Castro
or North Korea's Kim Il Sung.

of private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much

   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net

estimated last summer due mainly to a rise in the value of the
dollar against other major currencies, Forbes said Sunday.
   The estimate was far greater than the $2.8 billion that Fortune

   Yoshiaki Tsutsumi is a bit poorer than he was
last year _ make that less wealthy _ but the Japanese railroad
magnate still ranks as the world's richest person, according to
Forbes magazine.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal
net worth of at least $18.9 billion, making him the world's richest
person for the second straight year, Forbes said Thursday.
   The magazine, in a report on the richest people outside the
United States, estimated Tsutsumi's fortune at approximately $20
billion last fall in its first survey of the world's richest people.
   The story appears in the magazine's July 25 issue.
   The designation for Tsutsumi again puts Forbes at odds with
Fortune magazine. In its compilation of the world's billionaires
last October, Fortune estimated Tsutsumi's holdings in railroads,
hotels and golf clubs were worth a far smaller _ but still
substantial _ $2.5 billion.
   The second richest person on Forbes' list is also Japanese.
Taikichiro Mori, a former economics professor who owns 68 office
buildings in Tokyo, is worth $18 billion, the magazine estimated.
In the previous survey, Mori's fortune was put at $15 billion.
   Following the two Japanese are the Reichmann brothers of Canada,
who have built a $9 billion fortune in real estate, Forbes said.
   Shin Kyuk-ho, a South Korean with interests in candy making,
hotels and real estate, is ranked No. 4 ($8 billion-plus), and
Kenneth Cole Irving, a Canadian with interests in oil distribution,
paper and land, is No. 5 ($8 billion).
   The survey identifies 119 non-American individuals or families
around the world whose personal net assets are worth more than $1
billion, up from 90 in the previous list.
   The United States still accounts for more billionaires than any
other country, Forbes noted. The magazine said at least 47 American
individuals and 20 U.S. families are worth more than $1 billion,
compared with 32 individuals and families in second-place Japan and
16 in third-ranked West Germany.
   The leading American billionaire is Sam Walton, the head of
major retailer Wal-Mart Stores, who ranks seventh worldwide with a
net worth of $6.5 billion, Forbes estimates.
   Not all the fortunes listed in Forbes' list were amassed in a
respectable way.
   Three of them belong to people the magazine identified as
Colombian drug dealers, two individuals and one family, who are all
part of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Two of the Colombian cocaine fortunes, those of Pablo Escobar
Gaviria and the Ochoa family, are each more than $2 billion, Forbes
said. It estimated the third, amassed by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
at between $1.3 billion and $3 billion.

   A Japanese developer again topped a list of the
world's richest people, but the annual tally has one conspicuous
deletion this year: Donald J. Trump.
   Despite the financial troubles of the New York developer, the
United States continues to contain the world's largest number of
billionaires _ 62 _ according to estimates by Forbes magazine. In
addition, there are 37 U.S. families with fortunes over $1 billion,
Forbes says in its July 23 issue.
   Forbes, in estimates released Monday, says the world's
wealthiest person for the fourth straight year was Yoshiaki
Tsutsumi of Japan, whose railroad and real estate empire includes
golf courses, ski resorts and hotels. Forbes estimated his net
worth at $16 billion, up about $1 billion from last year.
   That estimate was far greater than that of rival business
magazine Fortune, which put Tsutsumi's net worth at $3.1 billion
last September.
   Fortune said the world's richest person is the Sultan of Brunei,
at $25 billion. Forbes excludes heads of state from consideration.
   Following the 56-year-old Tsutsumi on the Forbes list was
Japanese developer Taikichiro Mori, a former economics professor
who now owns 78 office buildings. Forbes put Mori's net worth at
$14.6 billion.
   Ranked third was the family of Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart,
the third-largest U.S.retail chain. Forbes estimates that the
Waltons, who also were third-ranked last year, are worth $13.3
billion, up from $8.7 billion in 1989.
   America's du Pont family was fourth, with a net worth estimated
at $10 billion. They were followed by Hans and Gad Rausing, two
Swedish brothers who control a packaging empire worth $9.6 billion.
   Kitaro Watanabe, a Japanese real estate owner, was sixth at $9.2
billion. He was followed by Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of
the Olympia &amp; York real estate company, at $9 billion.
   Kenkichi Nakajima and his family, founder of Japan's largest
maker of pachinko machines, a gambling game similar to pinball,
were eighth at $8.4 billion.
   South Korea's Shin Kyuk-ho, who owns a candy and real estate
empire, was ninth at $7 billion to $8 billion; and Forrest E. Mars
and family of the United States, of Mars candy fame, were 10th at
an estimated $6 billion.
   Other American families with net worth exceeding $3 billion
included the Newhouse, Hearst and Cox families, which derive their
fortunes from publishing and broadcasting; the Bass family of
Texas; the Mellon family of banking fame; the Dorrance family,
whose wealth comes from Campbell Soup Co.; and Bill Gates, founder
of the computer software company Microsoft Corp.
   John Werner Kluge remained the richest American individual,
according to Forbes. Kluge, founder of the media company
Metromedia, has an estimated net worth of $5.2 billion, placing him
in a tie for 12th place on the worldwide list with the Newhouses.
   As for Trump, Forbes put his net worth last year at $1.7
billion, but it dropped sharply this year as the value of his real
estate and airline empire plummeted. In April, the magazine said he
was worth about a half a billion dollars. Some sources peg it even
lower.
   Forbes says one trend it noticed in compiling this year's list
was the number of wealthy Germans. The magazine identified 38 West
German billionaire families _ far more per capita than in Japan or
the United States.
   The list includes 40 Japanese and 99 American individuals or
families with a net worth over $1 billion.
   Forbes says it identified 271 billionaire individuals or
families worldwide, up from 226 last year. The compilation is based
on recent stock valuations, comparable real estate valuations and
currency exchange rates, among other factors.
   The magazine says it excludes from consideration royal families
and heads of state because their wealth ``derives more from
political heritage than from economic effort.''
   But it doesn't exclude drug dealers. Among the billionaires it
lists are Colombia's Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the head of the
Medellin cocaine cartel, at about $3 billion, and Colombia's Ochoa
family, at about $2 billion.

A Japanese railway and real estate developer has earned the ranking of the 
world's richest businessman for the fourth straight year, according to Forbes' 
annual list of the world's billionaires released today. 
</P>
<P>
And American real estate tycoon Donald Trump, who suffered huge financial 
setbacks during the year, was dropped from the list. 
</P>
<P>

   The legion of American billionaires has
broadened to include 51 people, despite the 1987 stock market crash
that realigned the fortunes of many of the nation's wealthiest.
   Forbes magazine says its annual survey shows the net worth of
the ultra-affluent totaled $84.8 billion _ nearly $5 billion more
than the combined wealth of last year's 49 billionaires.
   The other 349 people who constitute Forbes' list of the 400
richest Americans were worth about $135.2 billion.The average
fortune is $551 million, up $1 million from last year.
   Topping the list released Monday is 70-year-old Sam Walton, who
held the No. 1 spot for the fourth straight year even though his
net worth shrank by $2 billion following the crash.
   Walton, head of the Arkansas-based Wal-Mart discount store
empire, scoffs at his $6.7 billion fortune. He calls it ``just
paper _ all I own is a pickup truck and a little Wal-Mart stock.''
   Forbes said Walton is the world's fifth-richest person after
Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, worth $18.9 billion; Taikichiro Mori,
$18 billion; and Haruhiko Yoshimoto, $7.8 billion; and Canada's
Kenneth Cole Irving, $8 billion.
   But last year's Oct. 19 financial market crash slashed fortunes
and caused 22 former members to be dropped from the list because
their fortunes slipped below Forbes' $225 million cutoff.
   The list appears in the Oct. 24 edition of Forbes and is based
on holdings as of Aug. 30.
   Runner-up to Walton on the U.S. billionaire list is John Werner
Kluge, the German-born head of Metromedia Co., with a net worth of
$3.2 billion. Kluge was followed by H. Ross Perot, founder of
Electronic Data Systems, with $3 billion; publishers Samuel I.
Newhouse Jr. and Donald Newhouse, $2.6 billion each; and Pittsburgh
industrialist Henry Lea Hillman, $2.5 billion.
   Underscoring the adage that the more you have, the more you can
lose, billionaires were among those hit hard by the crash.Among the
big losers were David Packard, founder of Hewlett-Packard, media
magnate Keith Rupert Murdoch and retailer Leslie Wexner, each of
whom lost up to 50 percent of their fortunes.
   Among those new to the billionaire club are flamboyant New York
real estate developer Donald Trump, who claims a net worth of $3.47
billion, though Forbes' estimate is in the $1 billion range.
   Joining Trump as list rookies are: Sumner Murray Redstone, who
boosted his balance sheet with the takeover of Viacom, $1.4
billion; press-shy Charles Feeney, who runs Duty-Free Shoppers at
airports, $1.3 billion; Charles Sammons, head of the privately held
Sammons Enterprises, the nation's 15th largest cable TV operator,
$1.3 billion; Charles de Ganahl Koch and David Hamilton Koch,
brothers involved in oil services, $1.1 billion each, and Ronald O.
Perelman, takeover strategist and head of Revlon, $1 billion.
   Four businessmen returned to the ranks of multimillionaire when
their fortunes sank below $1 billion: Laurence and Robert Tisch of
Loews Corp., each estimated at $850 million; Milton Petrie, the
philanthropist and head of Petrie Stores, $750 million; and
financier Carl Lindner II, $950 million.
   William Henry Gates III, who dropped out of Harvard and founded
the Microsoft software company, remained the youngest self-made
billionaire at age 32. His net worth is estimated at $1.1 billion.
   The oldest person new to the list is Mansfield Freeman, who
holds a stake in American International Group. With a fortune of
$240 million, he made the list for the first time at age 93.
   Among the 52 who disappeared from the list, 22 vanished because
of Black Monday-associated losses, 26 were surpassed by greater
fortunes and four died. Other Forbes standbys include: real estate
tycoon Harry Helmsley, $1.7 billion; takeover strategist Carl
Icahn, $940 million; brewer August Busch Jr., $1.1 billion;
designer Ralph Lauren, $450 million; cosmetics queen Estee Lauder,
$450 million; and vintners Ernest and Julio Gallo, $350 million
each.

   Charity began at home for Wal-Mart stores
founder Sam Walton, who ended a four-year reign as Forbes
magazine's richest American by sharing his $9 billion fortune with
his four children.
   Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge, with an estimated net
worth of $5.2 billion, climbed into first place on Forbes' annual
list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people.
   The prototypical member of Forbes' ultra-rich was a 63-year-old
male with 3.1 children working on his 1.4th marriage with a net
worth of $672 million last year, more than the gross national
product of Lesotho, Forbes said.
   The compilation contains 346 men and 54 women. Of those, 159
inherited their wealth. Eight states lack a resident on the list.
   Among alma mater represented, Yale educated 22 of the richest,
Harvard 17 and the University of Pennsylvania 12; the 45 with
master's degrees in business had an average net worth of $895
million, while the 10 high-school dropouts had an average of $854
million.
   Overall, Forbes' richest are worth an estimated total of about
$269 billion, up nearly $50 billion from last year, a 22 percent
increase that substantially outpaced last year's 4.4 percent
inflation rate.
   That total wealth would come just short of bailing out te
nation's failed savings and loans over the next 30 years, the cost
of which was estimated by Congress at $285 billion.
   The list, released Monday, appears in the Oct. 23 issue of
Forbes and is based on estimated holdings as of Sept. 8.
   At the pinnacle is Kluge, 75, of Charlottesville, Va., whose
holdings rose an estimated $2 billion from the previous year thanks
to a tripling in the value of his investment in cellular
telephones, Forbes said.
   Kluge moved up from the No. 2 spot. The magazine noted that
``klug'' in German means smart.
   Walton, 71, of Bentonville, Ark., who milked cows during the
Depression to support his family, split his Wal-Mart and other
assets equally with his four children. While the family's total
holdings increased from $6.7 bilion, the individual family members
tied for 20th on the list, each at $1.8 billion.
   Moving up to second from 12th place is investor Warren Buffett,
59, of Omaha, Neb., the head of Berkshire Hathaway, whose stock
market-based fortune nearly doubled, to $4.2 billion. Behind him is
Sumner M. Redstone, head of moviehouse operator National Amusements
Inc. and TV-cable giant Viacom, with $2.88 billion.
   The number of billionaires increased to 66 from 51. The minimum
net worth to make the list rose to $275 million from $225 million.
   America has more billionaires than any other nation _ Japan is
second with 41 _ but the richest of the world's rich are foreigners.
   Kluge's fortune makes him the ninth-wealthiest private
individual in the world, according to Forbes. He is topped by six
Japanese, a South Korean and Canadian publisher Kenneth Roy
Thompson. Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who made his money in land,
railroads and resorts, is worth about $15 billion, making him the
richest, Forbes said.
   Eighteen new billionaires joined the Forbes American list,
including Laurence and Robert Tisch of Loews Corp. at $1.36 billion
apiece, entertainment mogul Kirk Kerkorian at $1.29 billion,
indicted junk bond financier Michael Milken at $1.27 billion and
Trans World Airlines Inc. boss Carl Icahn at $1.2 billion.
   Donald Trump also is among the individual standouts, adding $700
million to his empire of hotels, casinos and an airline for a $1.7
billion total.
   For the second straight year, the youngest self-made billionaire
is 33-year-old William Gates III at $1.25 billion. Gates dropped
out of Harvard to found Microsoft, a computer software company, in
1972.
   St. Louis beer and baseball magnate August Anheuser Busch Jr.,
who died Sept. 29 at age 90, is included on the list with $1.5
billion. Forbes said it compiled its profiles before he died.
   The youngest person on the list is Caroline Marie Getty, 32,
daughter of the late George Getty, with her $330 million
inheritance. The oldest remained 94-year-old Mansfield Freeman of
Greensboro, Vt., whose $360 million worth includes a stake in
insurer American International Group.
   Among the losers were real estate investor and builder Fred
Trammell Crow, whose net worth, Forbes estimated, sank to $300
million from $775 million, thanks to softness in commercial real
estate. Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione slipped into something
less comfortable and dropped off the list.
   About 20 percent, or 82, of those listed live in or near New
York City; Los Angeles is second with 32 and San Francisco third at
19. Twenty-one people on the list own at least one-third of a major
league sports franchise.
   Publisher Malcolm Forbes included his own biographical data and
outside reported estimates of his net worth but refused, as usual,
to divulge his wealth. Forbes' sketch was included in the under
$500 million category. ``I'm solvent,'' he said.

Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge is worth an estimated $5.2 billion, 
but he had to back into first place on Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 
richest Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge displaced Sam Walton, head of the Wal-Mart stores discount chain, who 
divvied his $9-billion fortune among himself and his four children and ended a 
four-year reign as Forbes' wealthiest person. 
</P>
<P>
Among other notables on the list, developer Donald J. Trump compounded his 
already considerable fortune and financiers Michael Milken and Carl C. Icahn 
joined the billionaires club. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Forbes' richest are worth an estimated total of about $269 billion, up

By comparison, the total wealth of the richest would come just short of bailing

<P>
For the richest, the last year has been a very good one. Many of the wealthy 
rebounded nicely from the October, 1987, stock market crash.

<P>
America has more billionaires than any other nation -- Japan is second with 41

<HEAD>Wealthy Wal-Mart Founder Just Another Neighbor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER M. FULFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He's ranked as the richest man in the
nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville,
a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.
   ``He's just a part of the community,'' said Curt Loyd, executive
director of the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce. ``He's a neat
person. He calls Bentonville home, and that is special to us.''
   Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Mart
stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is again
shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the
world's top billionaires. According to Forbes magazine's July 24
edition, the Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, up
from its 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.
   ``He is unavailable,'' said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of the
silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain,
based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.
   Shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters Monday
morning, when the Forbes list appeared in newspapers. Shinkle said
news coverage about Walton ``usually sets off a press frenzy'' for
comments from him. But the 71-year-old businessman declined to
comment.
   ``He feels any attention to Sam Walton is to the individual and
he prefers attention to Sam Walton (the founder of) the company,''
Shinkle said.
   ``He very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings. It just
puts him in a position he doesn't want to be.''
   But Walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal
modesty. Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which Walton's
family-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lost millions in value, he
quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another
topic that it was only paper. Walton then changed the subject.
   Walton was first listed by Forbes as the nation's richest man in
October 1985. Three years ago, Forbes also began listing the world's
wealthiest people. Walton made that listing as the richest American
every year since. This year he ranks third, behind two Japanese
businessmen.
   Shinkle said Walton stays busy visiting many of the more than
1,400 stores operated by the company he started as a single
five-and-dime at Rogers more than two decades ago. He is out of the
office up to four days a week, the spokesman said.
   ``He spends most of his time talking to associates and
customers,'' Shinkle said, ``and he always comes back with many
ideas from them.''
   Wal-Mart calls its sales help associates instead of employees.
   When Walton first made the Forbes list of richest Americans,
recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, calls came in
from all over about the billionaire from the Ozarks.
   ``They wanted to know about the stock and the company,'' said
Simpson, who works for Stephens Inc. ``You'd think that he'd be
living in New York or LA, not Bentonville, Arkansas. But now people
just accept it.
   ``When it comes out now, it's just, `Yeah, he's still there,'''
Simpson said.

   Being a woman has not made it difficult to govern
Pakistan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto says, but it may have caused
some difficulties for her political opponents and Moslem
fundamentalists.
   ``I don't often think of myself as a woman prime minister,'' Ms.
Bhutto said in a televised interview Sunday with David Frost.
   ``I just think of myself as someone who's leading the government,
who's got a job to do, not an easy one, and who would like to have
the prayers of well-wishers everywhere in completing the task in
strengthening the rule of law and improving the quality of life for
the people of Pakistan.''
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, is the first woman in modern times to lead a
Moslem country and is the world's youngest prime minister.
   ``I think it may be a little difficult for my opponents or the
fundamentalists to have a woman prime minister,'' she said.
   ``Of course, it's different being a woman. There's a greater
formality or distance which must be followed so I try to make the
best of it.''
   Ms. Bhutto won power in November in Pakistan's first free
elections in more than a decade. She arrived in Britain on Wednesday
for a week's visit.

   A car dealer plunked down $25,000
for rock star Tina Turner's Mercedes-Benz, but a 1957 Porsche owned
by the late Roy Orbison failed to find a buyer.
   Bidders at Sunday's 13th Annual Newport Beach Collector Car
Auction, one of the nation's largest car auctions, spent $4 million
on 400 cars, the most expensive being a 1965 Ford Shelby 350
prototype that sold for $100,000.
   Miss Turner's 1984 Mercedes-Benz 280 GE wagon, which resembles a
Jeep, was purchased by an import car dealer in Springfield, Ill.,
said auction spokeswoman Christine Main.
   Among the celebrity cars that didn't sell were rock 'n' roll
singer Orbison's Porsche and a vintage Corvette belonging to
``Dynasty'' television star John James.

   Household hints columnist Heloise keeps
her larder stocked and has a maid to help clean up, but she doesn't
recommend that guests try to eat off the kitchen floor.
   The 38-year-old Heloise, whose real name is Ponce Kiah Marchelle
Heloise Cruse Evans, said she considers herself a good housekeeper,
but not a great one.
   The Dallas Morning News interviewed Heloise for its Sunday
editions to see if she follows her own ``helpful hints'' to good
housekeeping.
   ``If by your definition of good housekeeper _ can you eat off the
kitchen floor and are the baseboards clean and are the windows
shiny? _ then I'm probably not,'' she said.
   But, she added, ``we never run out of toilet paper and paper
towels in this house. There's always enough canned goods in there,
and bread and milk and butter and some fruit, so that no one's going
to starve.''
   Heloise lives with her husband and 14-year-old stepson.
   The columnist works out of her San Antonio home, but travels so
much that she needs a maid twice weekly to help with chores.

   Six of the world's 10 richest people are
Japanese, but the United States still leads in the number of
billionaires, according to Forbes magazine.
   For the third straight year, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list
of private billionaires, although his wealth shrank during the last
year.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, had a personal net
worth of at least $15 billion, down from $18.9 billion last summer.
The fall was attributed mainly to the rise in the value of the
dollar against other major currencies.
   In its July 24 issue, Forbes said second-ranked Taikichiro Mori,
a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings in Tokyo,
had an estimated net worth of $14.2 billion.
   Next was Sam Moore Walton, founder of the third-largest retailer
in the United States, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Walton and his family are
worth an estimated $8.7 billion.
   Others in the top 10 were: the Reichmann brothers, Canada, real
estate, more than $8 billion; Shin Kyuk-ho, South Korea, candy, real
estate, $8 billion; Hirotomo Takei and family, Japan, publishing,
real estate, $7.8 billion; Kitaro Watanabe, Japan, real estate,
hotels, $7 billion-plus; Haruhiko Yoshimoto and family, Japan, real
estate, $7 billion; Hans and Gad Rausing, Sweden, liquids packaging,
$7 billion; and Eitaro Itoyama, Japan, land, $6.6 billion.
   Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the
world with personal assets worth more than $1 billion. They included
55 Americans, 41 Japanese and 20 from West Germany.

   Martina Navratilova lost and laughed.
Steffi Graf won and cried. And about the only thing Boris Becker
fumbled at Wimbledon was the winner's trophy.
   ``I wanted it so badly that I put a little more pressure on
myself than usual,'' the 20-year-old Graf of West Germany said after
overpowering Navratilova in the final set to win her second straight
women's championship 6-2, 6-7, 6-1. ``It's an overwhelming feeling.''
   Also Sunday, Becker blasted passing shots down both lines to
defeat defending champion Stefan Edberg in straight sets in a
rematch of the 1988 final, claiming his third Wimbledon title in
five years.
   The 21-year-old West German, who regained the title he won in
1985 and 1986, defeated Edberg 6-0, 7-6, 6-4 in the most one-sided
final since John McEnroe allowed Jimmy Connors only four games in
1984.
   The championship trophy was the about only thing he couldn't
handle. As he strolled around Centre Court showing off the cup, he
light-heartedly juggled the trophy and fumbled it _ allowing the top
to pop off and onto the grass court.

is closing the gap, Forbes magazine said in its 10th annual ranking of the
richest.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans hit $288 billion -- the
highest ever recorded by Forbes. The list appears in the magazine's Oct. 21
issue.;   The recession made ex-moguls of some, mostly in real estate, where
values have dropped and vacancies skyrocketed, Forbes said in a report
released Sunday. A record 71 billionaires populate the list, up from 66 last
year and 13 in the magazine's first ranking in 1982.;   Fifty-eight of the 400
are women. The list's average age is 64.;   Amid the recession, Forbes
undertook something of an apology for wealth in America. The magazine, which
describes itself as a "capitalist tool," said in an essay that the rich are
having a tough time, too.;   "Since 1989 the economy has slowed -- for blacks,
for whites, for rich, for poor," Forbes said. "The median net worth of the
Forbes 400 has stagnated since 1989, not even keeping pace with inflation.";  
Forbes found that the fortune of Kluge, a 77-year-old German immigrant who
founded Metromedia Co., keeps growing. At an estimated $5.9 billion, it's up
$300 million from last year.;   No. 2 is William Henry Gates III, 35, a
Harvard dropout who in 1975 formed Microsoft, now the biggest computer
software maker. The bulk of his estimated worth of $4.8 billion comes from
company stock, Forbes said. Last year, he ranked 16th with $2.5 billion.;  
Gates replaces Warren Buffett, the Nebraska investor tapped to clean up
scandal-tainted Salomon Inc. Buffett's estimated stock-market fortune grew to
$4.2 billion from $3.3 billion, but he slipped to eighth on the list.;   Ahead
of him are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Sam Moore Walton and his family.
Walton divided his wealth equally among himself and his four children. Each is
estimated to be worth $4.4 billion.;   Next are industrialist Henry Lea
Hillman, $3.3 billion; Amway Corp. partners Richard Marvin DeVos and Jay Van
Andel, $2.9 billion each; and publishing brothers Samuel Newhouse Jr. and
Donald Newhouse, $2.8 billion apiece.;   The magazine said financier Michael
Milken's criminal guilty plea didn't erase his junk-bond driven fortune. He's
"making about 30 cents an hour at prison labor, to add to net worth estimated
over $700 million," Forbes said.;   Forbes said it bases the rankings on
inheritances, stock ownership and conservative estimates for private companies.  </TEXT>

   President Reagan's latest nominee for a seat
on the Federal Reserve Board has been accused of attempting to
dodge taxes in negotiating a $2.5-million ``golden parachute''
compensation agreement with the Boston bank holding company he
heads.
   John P. LaWare, chairman of Shawmut National Corp., said
Thursday he was not sure a tax dodge was involved in the agreement,
which he said was offered to assure him his $500,000 annual income
until he reaches age 65. He turned 60 on Feb. 20.
   Despite concern expressed by Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, there was no indication
the issue would affect LaWare's nomination.

   Retail sales rose between 3.5 percent and 4 percent in June,
helped by the hot weather and consumer purchases of summer
clothing, retailers have reported. For the year, sales were up 2.5
percent.
   Industry analysts remained cautious, however, about the outlook
for consumer spending. Some said the drought in the Midwest could
affect July sales.
   June sales also were aided by the markdowns retailers continued
to take to clear their inventories, the nation's largest retailers

   Last October's stock-market crash took its toll on U.S. fortunes, according to Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the 400 richest Americans. 

   Although Sam M. Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., remains the richest person in the U.S., the crash lopped off 31% of his fortune -- it fell to $5.9 billion from $8.5 billion. 
By August, Mr. Walton's fortune was back up to $6.7 billion, more than double that of second-ranked John Werner Kluge, principal owner of Metromedia Co. 

   Three others in the top 10 of last year's Forbes 400 watched their fortunes drop 32% to 50% in the week after the crash. 
Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate, who saw a 48% loss, to $1.1 billion from $2.1 billion, in the week after the crash, fell to 35th place from eighth with a net worth of $1.08 billion. 
Hewlett-Packard Co. Chairman David Packard, who had a 32% drop, to $1.9 billion from $2.87 billion after the crash, fell nine spots in the ranking to 13th with a fortune of $2 billion. 
Limited Inc. Chairman Leslie Wexner, who saw a 50% drop to $1.05 billion from $2.1 billion after the crash, fell to 49th place from 10th with $1 billion. 

   Of the 52 who dropped off the "Forbes 400" list, 22 fell because their stocks declined. 

   Although tops in the U.S., Mr. Walton is the sixth-richest person in the world. 
Above him on the list are three Japanese, a Korean and a Canadian.

   If you wondered why oil is worth fighting for,
take a look at Fortune magazine's latest ranking of the world's
billionaires.
   The two richest people on the face of the earth are oil barons,
the magazine reported Tuesday.
   Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, oil-rich leader of the tiny
Pacific sultanate of Brunei, retained Fortune's top title for the
fourth straight year with an estimated worth of $25 billion,
unchanged from 1989.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and clan, a focus of the Persian Gulf
crisis, ranked second with assets worth $18 billion, also unchanged
from last year.
   Fortune spokeswoman Emma Dockendorff said those estimates were
based partly on oil prices in mid-July, when one barrel of crude
fetched about $18.
   Prices have since surged to about $28 a barrel following Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the U.S. move to protect neighboring
Saudi Arabia. That price jump would make the sultan and the king
potentially even wealthier.
   The ranks of Fortune's richest _ bankrolled by assets ranging
from oil to sneakers to ball bearings _ swelled by 25 names this
year to 182 individuals and families, controlling a combined empire
worth $471.3 billion.
   That's up about 7 percent from last year and enough to erase the
U.S. budget deficit, trade deficit and a good chunk of the savings
&amp; loan bailout tab.
   Fortune released the fourth annual ranking in its Sept. 10
issue. It said the average entrant's wealth was only slightly
higher compared with last year after adjusting for inflation.
   But the average fortune was still worth about $2.6 billion,
which if invested in 7.5 percent U.S. Treasury bills would earn
$534,000 a day.
   ``True, you shouldn't feel too sorry for folks who have their
own islands and castles, use Reniors for wallpaper and control, in
the aggregate, $471.3 billion,'' Fortune said.
   As competitor Forbes magazine did in its annual list released
last month, Fortune ditched the Sultan of New York, Donald J.
Trump, whose real estate and casino empire is bogged down in debt.
The magazine had estimated his holdings at $1.7 billion last year.
   Fortune placed Trump in a separate category of fallen tycoons,
who also included troubled takeover strategist James Goldsmith and
convicted financier Michael Milken.
   Ranked third on Fortune's list was the reclusive Mars family of
the United States, whose holdings include Mars Inc. candy bars,
Uncle Ben's Rice and Kal-Kan pet food, worth $12.5 billion.
   Fourth was Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, the wealthiest woman,
with an untaxed personal fortune of $11.7 billion in riches ranging
from 267,000 acres of Royal real estate to racehorses, crown jewels
and a vast stock portfolio.
   Fifth was the Newhouse family of the United States, owners of a
large media empire, worth $11.5 billion; sixth was the Reichmann
family of Canada, with extensive real estate holdings valued at
$11.1 billion; tied for seventh were Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, Japan's
richest industrialist, and Arkansas retailing mogul Sam Walton,
both valued at $7.3 billion; eighth was John W. Kluge of the United
States, owner of media giant Metromedia Inc., valued at $7.0
billion; ninth was Tsai Wan-lin and family of Taiwan, owners of a
construction and insurance empire worth $6.5 billion; 10th was the
Thomson family, owners of Canada's biggest newspaper chain, at $6.2
billion.
   American newcomers included the Stephens family of Arkansas,
owners of investment banking, energy and real estate holdings worth
$1.7 billion; the Parfet family of Kalamazoo, Mich., owners of a
large stake in the Upjohn Co. drugmaker, worth $1.5 billion; and
Philip Knight, head of the Nike Inc. athletic footwear maker, $1.3
billion.
   Foreign newcomers included Alicia and Esther Koplovitz of Spain,
owners of a $2.2 billion construction and banking fortune; Hiroshi
Termachi, owner of a $1.8 billion Japanese ball bearing business;
and John Spyros Latsis, European head of a Saudi Arabian shipping
and oil-refinery network worth $1.8 billion.
   The magazine based estimates of net worth on what it called
``published information or appraisals of asset values.'' To
qualify, each prospect needed a net worth of $1 billion or more
after subtracting debt.
   Fortune said the United States remained home to the greatest
number of billionaires at 58. Twenty were from the Persian Gulf, 15
from West Germany, nine from Italy, and eight in Japan, down from
12 last year.

   Queen Elizabeth II, whose personal fortune is a
closely guarded secret, is Britain's richest person worth an
estimated $5.87 billion, according to a list of the nation's 200
richest people.
   The list was front-page news in London on Thursday, with racy
tabloid headlines ranging from ``Filthy Rich'' in the Sun to
``Millionaires Galore'' in the Daily Mail.
   Money Magazine, which complied the list, said the
second-wealthiest Briton as 92-year-old Sir John Moores, founder of
the Littlewoods soccer pools empire, a weekly game for small-time
gamblers based on soccer results. It estimated his fortune at $2.99
billion.
   It listed the third-wealthiest Briton as supermarket chain owner
Garfield Weston, 60, chairman of Associated British Foods, with an
estimated personal fortune at $2.64 billion.
   In fourth place is the 36-year-old Duke of Westminster. His
inherited holdings include large chunks of highly desireable real
estate in central London, huge tracts of farmland and sweeping
acres of remote northern moorland. The magazine said his personal
fortune was about $2.46 billion.
   Money Magazine says Britain has seven billionaires, 18 families
and individuals worth more than $440 million each, and 20,000
millionaires as measured in pounds.
   The magazine's estimate of the 61-year-old queen's wealth makes
her the world's eighth-richest individual. It said the world's
richest person is the Sultan of Brunei, with an estimated fortune
equivalent to $24.64 billion.
   The Guinness Book of Records lists the richest person in the
United States as Sam Moore Walton, founder of Wal-Mart discount
stores in Bentonville, Ark., whose personal wealth was estimated in
mid-1987 at $4.5 billion ``and rising.''
   Money Magazine said financier Sir James Goldsmith _ fifth in its
list of Britain's wealthiest 200 with an estimated $1.76 billion _
was the only British billionaire to have made all his money since
the end of World War II in 1945.
   The youngest person in the top 200 is 31-year-old Sophie Mirman,
with an estimated $52.8 million. She and her husband, Richard Ross,
created the popular Sock Shop chain.
   Among the 12 women in the top 200 list are ``Dynasty'' star Joan
Collins and her sister, Jackie Collins, the author of a string of
best-selling raunchy novels. It said they are worth an estimated
$26.4 million between them.
   Editor Sue Thomas said it took six months to compile the list,
``consulting public sources of information and talking extensively
to analysts in the City,'' London's financial district.
   ``The people we did not talk to were the 200 themselves because
we wanted to keep the list under wraps until the last possible
minute. Many of the super-rich are very secretive,'' she said.
   Asked how it estimated the queen's wealth in view of the secrecy
maintained by her London bankers, Coutts and Co., Mrs. Thomas said:
``We found out as much as we could about the different headings
under which her wealth falls _ her castles and other properties,
her land holdings, her vast share portfolio, her stamp collection,
her art collection, her jewelry collection and so forth and we
talked to a lot of people with information.
   ``We arrived at what we estimate to be a minimum net worth for
all the people on our list.''
   It said 53 of the 200 fortunes stemmed from property. Five
percent of those listed came from abroad and only 15 percent belong
to the British aristocracy. The self-made rich outnumbered those
who inherited their wealth by 2-1.

It will take a lot more than the collapse of the Japanese stock market to
knock Japan's Taikichiro Mori off his perch as the world's wealthiest
person.
Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the world's billionaires shows that
despite falling property prices the 88-year-old Japanese real estate tycoon
still boasted a personal fortune of Dollars 13bn. Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, 58, a
railway and golf course tycoon, remains the second richest with a Dollars
10bn fortune arising from a 40 per cent stake in the family-run company,
Kokudo.
By contrast, Bill Gates, the 36-year-old Harvard dropout and founder of
Microsoft, may be the richest American, but he is only worth Dollars 6.4bn.
But despite Japan's pole position, the US tops the list with 101 individuals
or families out of 291 worth Dollars 1bn or more. Germany is second with 44
billionaire fortunes and Japan comes in third with 34. For the first time,
Richard Branson joins the billionaires list; Forbes says he is worth about
Dollars 1.2bn.
But it is Latin America which has unearthed a surge of capitalist energy; up
from eight to 21 billionaires this year.

   The past year yielded a bumper crop of billionaires, according to Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the 400 richest Americans. 

   The number of billionaires on the Forbes list nearly doubled over the last year to 49, an increase of 23 from 1986. 
The magazine credited the rising stock and real estate markets for the swelling ranks of billionaires. 

   The richest person on the list remains Sam M. Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores, whose net worth was estimated at $8.5 billion. 

   Among the new billionaires were candy heiress Jacqueline Mars Vogel, brewer August A. Busch Jr., media magnate Rupert Murdoch, Microsoft Corp. Chairman William H. Gates, CBS Inc. Chairman Laurence Tisch, and Ted Arison, who took Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. public this year. 

   Some multimillionaires lost their slots on the Forbes list. 
Rock 'n' roll's Dick Clark and "Dynasty" producer Aaron Spelling slipped from the list because their newly public companies took downturns. 
Motown's Berry Gordy, Apple Computer Inc. founder Steven Jobs and oilman Armand Hammer were replaced by people with larger fortunes. 

   Another name missing from the list: Ivan Boesky, the Wall Street arbitrager who admitted insider-trading violations.

   The world has 32 new billionaires this year,
according to a list compiled by Fortune magazine, including indicted
junk-bond chieftan Michael R. Milken and a Taiwanese tycoon with
holdings in insurance, hotels and soy sauce companies.
   Meanwhile, the same five individuals or families who topped last
year's list also lead the 1989 ranking, the magazine reports in its
Sept. 11 edition, due on newsstands today.
   The list swelled to 157 members this year with the addition of 32
members, although five others fell off the ranking. The list
includes individuals and nuclear families with net worth Fortune
estimates at $1 billion or more.
   Taiwanese investor Tsai Wan-Lin, 64, joined the list at the No. 6
spot. The former poor farmer saw his 65 percent stake in Cathay Life
Insurance in Taipei skyrocket in value and his net worth increase to
$9 billion as the Taiwan stock market took off, Fortune said.
   Milken, 43, who faces trial on federal charges that he violated
securities laws, joined the list at No. 125, with an estimated
fortune of $1.2 billion.
   The Sultan of Brunei, who presides over the small oil-rich nation
near the South China Sea, is still the world's wealthiest man with
an estimated fortune of $25 billion, the magazine stated.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and his family are next with $18
billion, followed by Forrest E. Mars Sr. and the Mars candy-bar
clan, who are estimated to be worth $12.5 billion.
   Ranked fourth after the Mars family was the world's richest
woman, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, who is worth an estimated $10.9
billion compared with $8.7 billion last year, Fortune reported.
   Fifth on the list were New York-based publishing magnates Samuel
I. Newhouse Jr. and Donald E. Newhouse, worth an estimated $10
billion.
   Wal-Mart Stores mogul Sam Moore Walton, of Bentonville, Ark., was
seventh with $8.9 billion; the Reichmann brothers _ Albert, Paul and
Ralph _ whose Ontario-based Olympia &amp; York is the largest owner of
New York City commercial real estate, are eighth with $8.4 billion;
British real estate tycoon Gerald Grosvenor is ninth with $6.9
billion; and Kenneth Roy Thomson, who controls Canada's Thomson
Newspapers Ltd., was ranked No. 10 with estimated wealth of $6.9
billion.
   Among other newcomers are Carl C. Icahn, the takeover strategist
who also is chairman and chief stockholder of Trans World Airlines
Inc. and worth an estimated $1.2 billion; Turner Broadcasting System
Chairman Ted Turner, $1.3 billion; Kirk Kerkorian, helped by the
sale this year of MGM-UA Communications Co., $1.1 billion; and
Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon Inc., $3.2 billion.
   Of those on the list, there are 58 in the United States, 54 in
Europe, 23 in Asia, including 11 Japanese, and 22 others.

   John Werner Kluge, founder of Metromedia Inc., jumped to No. 1 on Forbes magazine's list of the richest Americans. 

   Mr. Kluge, who Forbes said has a net worth of more than $5.2 billion, succeeds Sam Walton, the former chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
The list is in the Oct. 23 issue. 

   Mr. Walton dropped to 20th, because he split his fortune among himself and his four children and quit as chief executive of Wal-Mart, which operates more than 1,300 stores. 
Mr. Walton has a net worth of $1.8 billion, as currently do each of his children. 

   An owner of cellular-telephone franchises, Mr. Kluge added about $2 billion to his net worth from a recent agreement to sell Metromedia's New York City franchise to McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. 

   Warren Buffett, head of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. investment company, jumped from 12th place to second. 
Sumner M. Redstone, chief executive of National Amusements and Viacom International Inc. leapt 19 spots to third. 

   New York was the home state of 80 of those named on the list, 25% more than any other state.

Metromedia Co. founder John Werner Kluge topped Fortune magazine's list of the 
400 richest people in America today, unseating Sam Walton who held the honor 
for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
The Wal-Mart Stores fortune was divided this year among Walton and his four 
children, sending each of them, with $1.8 billion each, to share the No. 17 
spot on the magazine's annual list. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge, who placed second in 1988, has an estimated net worth of more than $5.2 
billion, adding about $2 billion to last year's coffers with lucrative sales of 
cellular phone licenses, Forbes said. The Charlottesville, Va., and New York 
City resident also launched a computerized billboard painting company and holds 
a majority stake in Orion Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Earning second place this year was investor Warren Edward Buffett, of Omaha, 
Neb., whose worth was placed at more than $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Third place went to National Amusements Inc. founder Sumner Murray Redstone, 
who earned part of his $2.88 billion by purchasing and taking public Viacom 
Inc. and also battling Kluge for control of Orion. 
</P>
<P>
Placing fourth was Ted Arison of Miami Beach, founder of Carnival Cruise Lines. 
Leveraged buyout artist Ronald Perelman earned fifth place, while publishers 
Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr. and his brother, Donald, shared sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the top 10 were media owners Barbara Cox Anthony and sister Anne Cox 
Chambers, Texas businessman H. Ross Perot, financier brothers Jay Arthur and 
Robert Alan Pritzker, and real estate magnate A. Alfred Taubman. 
</P>
<P>
Seven out of the top 10 had significant interests in media and communications, 
while two of the biggest casualties this year were in real estate, Forbes said. 
Trammell Crow's fortune slipped to $300 million from $775 million, while 
Dallas' Alfred Mack Pogue slipped off the list altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Squeaking by at No. 400, with an estimated $275 million or more, was Nan Tucker 
McEvoy, granddaughter of San Francisco Chronicle founder Michael H. de Young. 
Her wealth beats out more than three-quarters of the people on Forbes' first 
list in 1982, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six people are newcomers this year, 15 of whom owe their new-found 
status to inheritances, Forbes said. They include the Waltons; the Dorrance 
family, founders of Campbell Soup Co., and the granddaughters of the late J. 
Paul Getty. 
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of those on the list inherited their wealth, the magazine said. 
Among the 60 from last year's list who failed to make this year's cut were 
Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, New York Times publisher Arthur Ochs 
Sulzberger and turnaround artist Bennett Lebow, undone in part by a takeover 
attempt of Prime Computer, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six people on the list are billionaires, while just 54 of the 400 are 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Others on the 1989 list include media mogul Ted Turner, No. 18; publisher 
Rupert Murdoch, No. 26, and indicted junk bond king Michael Milken No. 38 with 
an estimated $1.27 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Among the real estate magnates were developer Donald Trump, No. 19, Harry 
Helmsley, No. 22, and Samuel LeFrak, No. 24.

<HEAD>Attorney For Nation's Richest Man Appealing $11.5 Million Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for Sam Walton, the nation's
richest man and chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., on Tuesday sought
to repeal an $11.5 million fine against his client in connection
with a personal injury suit.
   The motion filed in 352nd District Court argues that the
sanctions violated a stay issued by the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals
and Walton's constitutional rights of appeal.
   ``This unreasonable ruling must be reversed. When a judge enters
an order so patently wrong, the party suffereing the abuse should be
vindicated at the very first opportunity,'' attorney Vic Anderson
said in the motion.
   The issue surfaced this summer when Walton was asked to give a
deposition in a lawsuit filed by Andrew Carrizales of Houston
against Wal-Mart and manager Jerry Rand. Carrizales claims that
while shopping at the company's Sulphur Springs store in 1986 he
slipped and fell on clear oil spilled on the floor.
   When Walton failed to provide testimony, former 352nd District
Court Judge John Street ordered him to appear in Fort Worth for a
deposition. But the Texas Supreme Court said Street's ruling was a
clear abuse of discretion.
   Street modified his order and required Walton to submit to a
videotape deposition at the company's headquarters in Bentonville,
Ark. Walton refused and Street imposed sanctions against him for
violating the modified order.
   Fines began at $10,000 on Nov. 28 and reached $1.28 million
before dropping back to $1 million a day. Walton eventually showed
up for a deposition in Fort Worth on Dec. 15.
   However, Anderson says the 2nd Court of Appeals in Fort Worth
granted a stay of Street's order five days after it was issued Nov.
18. The stay dissolved on Dec. 12 and Walton showed up two days
later.
   Walton is currently listed as the nation's richest man by Forbes
magazine, with a net worth of about $6.7 billion.

   Wal-Mart Stores founder Sam Walton and family
remained the wealthiest people in the United States last year even
though the value of their stock lost more than $135 million, U.S.
News &amp; World Report says.
   The Waltons of Bentonville, Ark., whose stores are fixtures in
small-town America, held $6.13 billion worth of stock in Wal-Mart,
keeping them atop the magazine's Richest 100 list for the third
straight time since the rankings began three years ago, U.S. News
said in its Aug. 1 editions.
   To make the list, an individual or family must own at least 5
percent of the shares of a publicly traded company. This is the
level the government considers large enough to influence management.
   In second spot again were Irenee and Edward du Pont and family
of Wilmington, Del., with $3.38 billion worth of the giant chemical
firm. U.S. News said the du Ponts kept the ranking despite a $1.3
billion loss in stock value in the 12 months ending in Marchy.
   David Packard, the computer pioneer from Los Altos Hills,
Calif., jumped from seventh spot in 1987 to third this year, with
$2.56 billion worth of holdings in Hewlett-Packard Co.
   No. 4 in the latest list were Carl Lindner and family of
Cincinnati, with $2.3 billion worth of holdings in food, financial
services, retailing and electronics firms. The Lindners were not in
the Top 10 last year.
   In fifth spot, up one from 1987, were John Dorrance Jr. and
family of Gladwyne, Pa., with $2.05 billion worth of the Campbell
Soup Co.
   Others in the Top 10 were Edgar and Charles Bronfman and family
of New York and Montreal, Seagram Co. Ltd., $1.88 billion; Sid,
Lee, Robert and Edward Bass of Ft. Worth, Texas, a variety of
holdings, $1.75 billion; Warren Buffett of Omaha, Neb., Berkshire
Hathaway, $1.64 billion; William Ford and family of Grosse Point
Shores, Mich., Ford Motor Co., $1.62 billion; and the Bancroft
family of New York, Dow Jones &amp; Co., $1.61 billion.
   U.S. News said the Bancrofts fell from third position in 1987
because of a $1.19 billion loss in stock value last year. It said
other stock-value losses included $859 million for the Bronfmans,
$510 million for the Dorrances and $320 million for the Lindners.
   U.S. News said the year's biggest money loser was Leslie Wexner
of Columbus Ohio, whose holdings in The Limited clothing stores
fell in value by $1.4 billion, or nearly 55 percent. Wexner was
ranked 17th among 18 billionaires on the list.

and considerably richer than he was last year, says Fortune
magazine.
   The sultan, whose wealth is mainly in oil and gas reserves
and real estate, now has $31 billion, up from $25 billion in
1990, according to Fortune's annual survey of billionaires.

   This year, there are 202 billionaires on Fortune's list,
up from 182 in 1990, with 41 new billionaires added and 26
delisted. Average net worth is $2.7 billion, up $100 million

   The U.S. has 60 billionaires, the most of any country,
including the second-biggest billionaire, Sam Walton, who is
worth, along with his family, $21.1 billion. Germany has 23
billionaires, including Prince Albert von Thurn und Taxis; at
eight years old, he is the youngest billionaire on Fortune's
list. Switzerland, the U.K. and Japan have 23, 14 and 12,
respectively.
   Newcomers to the list are Donald and Doris Fisher, $1.9
billion, who founded the GAP Inc. clothing chain; and Samuel
Heyman, $1.5 billion, who owns most of chemical maker GAF.
Among the fallen are Rupert Murdoch and Harold Simmons, both
victims of wilting stocks.
   The magazine also profiled 13 billionairesses. Leading the
pack was Queen Elizabeth II, whose net worth was reported at
$10.7 billion. New York cosmetics queen Estee Lauder and
family are second, with $5.2 billion.

   The legion of American billionaires has grown to
51 people, despite the 1987 stock market crash that realigned the
fortunes of many of the nation's wealthiest.
   Forbes magazine says its annual survey shows the net worth of
the ultra-affluent totaled $84.8 billion _ nearly $5 billion more
than the combined wealth of last year's 49 billionaires.
   The 349 others in Forbes' list of the 400 richest Americans were
worth about $135.2 billion.The average fortune is $551 million, up
$1 million from last year.
   Topping the list released Monday is 70-year-old Sam Walton, who
held the No. 1 spot for the fourth straight year even though his
net worth shrank by $2 billion following the Oct. 19 stock market
crash.
   But Walton, head of the Arkansas-based Wal-Mart discount store
empire, scoffs at his $6.7 billion fortune, calling it ``just paper
_ all I own is a pickup truck and a little Wal-Mart stock.''

   Iranians involved in the Iran-Contra affair
thought George Bush was the ``most powerful man in the world'' and
the person pulling the strings from behind the scenes, according to
a new book.
   The book is written by Michael A. Ledeen, a former consultant to
the National Security Council who played a role in the earliest
stages of the affair. He says the Iranians overestimated Bush's
importance because the vice president was a former director of the
CIA, which they considered to be the root of ultimate power in the
United States.
   Ledeen says his book is an attempt to shed light on how the
Iran-Contra affair happened and ``set the record straight about
myself and my role in the affair.''
   ``Perilous Statecraft: An Insider's Account of the Iran-Contra
Affair'' is published by Charles Scribner's Sons. The book mixes
Ledeen's firsthand view of certain events, his opinions and his
interpretation of material that was uncovered during congressional
hearings in the summer of 1987.

   Texas Democrats watched in dismay the past
several weeks as Republican presidential nominee George Bush
pounded rival Michael Dukakis on gun control, crime and the Pledge
of Allegiance.
   But in the wake of vice presidential nominee and Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen's debate success, Democrats say the Lone Star state _
and its third largest Election Day prize of 29 electoral votes _
once again is up for grabs.
   ``I was kind of down in the dumps a couple of weeks ago. We were
pinned down on the beach for a while. But now we're getting air
support and we're going to drive those folks back,'' said Ed
Martin, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party.
   Hours after last week's vice presidential debate, Dukakis and
Bentsen campaigned in East Texas while the Democratic ticket
unleashed new ads rebutting Bush's claim that Dukakis is soft on
crime.

   Hobbled by an independent challenge that
has siphoned off some of his conservative support, Republican Gov.
Norm Bangerter is a distinct underdog in his bid for a second term.
   Democrat Ted Wilson holds a double-digit lead in the polls, and
independent Merrill Cook commands the loyality of Republicans who
blame the governor for the biggest tax increase in Utah history.
   However, Bangerter and his supporters contend there is time
before November's election to reclaim the support that swept him
into office four years ago as Utah's first Republican governor in
two decades.
   ``The polls are tightening and I think Norm could pull this
out,'' Charles Akerlow, former state GOP chairman, said recently.
``He's running hard and running scared and, consequently, running
very well.''

   Lax security at Energy Department nuclear
weapons laboratories has allowed agents from the Soviet bloc and
other countries to gain access to sensitive research facilities,
congressional investigators reported today.
   The visits took place at the national laboratories at Los Alamos
and Sandia in New Mexico and Livermore in California, where
scientists conduct advanced research on nuclear weapons and the
Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars, according to a
congressional report.
   The foreign visitors included specialists from the Soviet bloc,
China and nations which are believed either to have nuclear weapons
or are seeking to develop them, including India, Pakistan, Israel,
Brazil and Argentina.
   Officials at the FBI and CIA declined to discuss possible
espionage investigations stemming from the incidents and it was not
clear whether any secrets had been lost, according to the report by
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

   When Richard Wagner put him on the operatic stage
in 1845, Tannhauser was a noble knight with one girlfriend too many
_ the pagan goddess of love. Now, he's a television evangelist with
the same problem.
   The goddess in Peter Sellars' production of ``Tannhauser,''
which premiered Monday evening at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, lives
in a sleazy Las Vegas motel and is attended by nymphs wearing only
their bikini tops for the first 90 seconds of Act 1.
   Tannhauser himself, sung by tenor Richard Cassilly, bears a
certain resemblance to the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart.
   Tannhauser confesses to his sins of the flesh during a ceremony
at a crystal cathedral clearly modeled on the Rev. Robert
Schuller's headquarters in California. In February, Swaggart
confessed to committing unspecified sins against his family and
God, while a prostitute maintained he had paid her to pose nude in
a motel room.

   In all, there are 161 recipes in the revised publication,
``Quantity Recipes for Type A School Lunches,'' the first new model
since 1971.
   School meals are served to 24 million children in 90,000 schools

   Babe Ruth drank here, between innings. Bill Veeck

And future baseball legends, it now appears, will get a chance to
become part of the lore at McCuddy's saloon.
   The tavern is one of 11 businesses scheduled for demolition as
the state clears the area around ancient Comiskey Park for a new
stadium for Chicago's White Sox by 1991.
   But Gov. James R. Thompson has promised that McCuddy's, with a
little help from the state, will rise from those ashes like a
phoenix in the same spot it has occupied for 78 years _ directly
across the street from Comiskey Park.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Pat Senese, the bar's 65-year-old owner, said
Monday. ``My wife is the third generation of the McCuddy family to
have a stake in this and now we know it'll go on beyond that.''

<HEAD>Magazine Says Mars Candy Bar Family Richest in America</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mars candy-bar clan is worth $12.5 billion,
surpassing the Newhouse publishing dynasty as the richest family in
America, Fortune magazine reports.
   If Fortune's estimate is correct, the worth of the Marses could
buy about 25 billion regular-size Snickers bars, which if laid end
to end would circle the planet Mars nearly 32 times.
   The magazine's calculation is more than any previous estimate of
the wealth of the secretive family, which shuns publicity about
itself and its candy bar company, maker of Snickers and M&amp;Ms.
   ``Mars's assets are often underestimated because the company is
as loose with information as its McLean, Va., neighbor, the CIA,''
Fortune said Wednesday in an advance press release about its 1988
Billionaires List, to be carried in the Sept. 12 issue available on
newsstands next Monday.
   The magazine said it based the estimate of the Marses' wealth on
what comparable food concerns have sold for recently.
   ``Thus, Forrest Mars and his three children, Forrest Jr., John
and Jacqueline, overtake the Newhouse publishing magnates as the
richest Americans,'' Fortune said.
   Still, the Marses rank No. 3 on Fortune's worldwide list. The
richest remains the Sultan of Brunei, whose oil wealth makes him
worth $25 billion. Next is King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and family,
worth $18 billion.
   Fourth is Britain's Queen Elizabeth II with $8.7 billion; next
is the Newhouses, whose communications holdings are worth $8
billion; in sixth place is retail king Sam Walton, founder of
Wal-Mart stores, and family, worth $7.4 billion; seventh is
Canada's Reichmann family, with $6.3 billion in assets that range
from swank New York real estate to interests in railroads and
utilities.
   Eighth is Kenneth Irving and family, a Canadian clan that owns
400 companies worth $6.2 billion; ninth is Kenneth Thomson and
family, Canadian owners of a publishing, retailing, energy and real
estate empire worth $6 billion; and in 10th place is Gerald
Grosvenor and family, British land barons worth $5.4 billion.
   Of the 129 individuals and nuclear families that comprise this
year's list, there are 51 in the United States, 38 in Europe, 19 in
Asia _ including 12 Japanese _ 13 Arabs and eight others, Fortune
said.

   The Communist Party has changed its
name and embraced democratic aspirations, but its members on Monday
retained the head of the old party in a compromise vote.
   Delegates to the closed session said Rezsoe Nyers was chosen as
head of the Hungarian Socialist Party's collective presidency after
dissatisfied reformers reluctantly agreed to support him.
   Hours before beginning the closed session, the party congress
adopted a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a break
with the Marxist-Leninist orientation of its Communist predecessor.
   Despite the stated commitment to democracy, reformist delegates
have expressed concern that the new party does not differ
sufficiently from its predecessor. The choice of Nyers to continue
as leader was expected to increase the anxiety of some who wanted a
clean break with the past.

   Two University of California cancer
researchers won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday and immediately
reaped the perquisites of success: box seats at the National League
baseball playoffs.
   ``We're off to the game _ just got tickets,'' a jubilant J.
Michael Bishop said shortly after he and Harold E. Varmus learned
that they had won this year's prize.
   The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute,
Sweden's largest and oldest medical university, cited Bishop and
Varmus for their discovery that cancer genes in certain viruses are
altered forms of normal animal genes.
   The research helped scientists understand how cancer begins, and
it ``widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which
govern the normal growth of cells,'' the assembly said.

   The operator of the Rocky Flats nuclear arms
plant knew as early as 1984 that dangerous amounts of radioactive
plutonium may have accumulated in building air ducts but failed to
act on the information, a former employee said Monday.
   James Stone, a utility design engineer at the site from 1980 to
1986, said he raised the probability of such plutonium deposits _
and the safety hazard they would pose _ with Rockwell International
Corp., which operates the plant near Denver under an Energy
Department contract.
   ``They said we cannot afford to clean it,'' Stone said in a
telephone interview.
   Stone's suspicion of a buildup of plutonium residue in the
ventilation system at Rocky Flats was borne out by a team of
independent investigators who disclosed in a report to the Energy
Department last week that such plutonium deposits raised ``a real
possibility'' of an accidental nuclear chain reaction at Rocky
Flats.

   Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge is

place on Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 richest Americans.
   Kluge displaced Sam Walton, head of the Wal-Mart stores discount
chain, who divided his $9 billion fortune among himself and his
four children and ended a four-year reign as Forbes's wealthiest
person.
   Among other notables on the list released Monday, developer
Donald Trump compounded his already considerable fortune and
financiers Michael Milken and Carl Icahn joined the billionaires
club.
   Overall, Forbes' richest are worth an estimated total of about
$269 billion, up nearly $50 billion from the previous year, a 22
percent increase that substantially outpaced last year's 4.4
percent inflation rate.

   Some might think a television show about
home renovation would be as exciting as watching paint dry. But
PBS' ``This Old House'' has long since proved that Americans love
to watch other people fix up fixer-uppers.
   Now ``This Old House'' has this new host: Steve Thomas, an
eclectic blend of Thor Heyerdahl, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Robert
Redford.
   PBS officials hope that Thomas, 36, an expert sailor, carpenter,
world traveler and writer, will dispel the whiff of scandal that
hovered over the show when its original host, Bob Vila, left over a
conflict of interest.
   The popular Vila began as co-host of the show with master
carpenter Norm Abram 11 years ago. He left after last season when
an underwriter withdrew funding in a dispute over Vila's commercial
endorsements.

   The wealthy are getting a dose of what many
Americans already know: rougher economic times.
   Forbes reported Monday that the nation's 400 richest individuals
suffered a decline in net worth this year for the first time since
the magazine began compiling the list eight years ago.
   Fifty-three of the Forbes 400 list lost anywhere from $100
million to $880 million, the magazine said in its Oct. 22 edition.
The minimum net worth required to join the elite ranking, which had
risen steadily from 1982 to 1989, dropped from $275 million last
year to $260 million this year.
   Some names such as casino monger Donald J. Trump were evicted,
another symbolic boot to the 1980s era of living on borrowed money.
Forbes said Trump's fortune, estimated at $1.7 billion in 1989, was
possibly within ``hailing distance of zero'' because of looming
loans and a slow economy.
   Trump, who previously has denounced Forbes for downgrading his
ranking on the list, did not return a telephone call for comment.
   ``It's not just the year Donald Trump's and some other
overleveraged fortunes hit the wall,'' the magazine said. ``This
year the entire Forbes 400 list seemed to stop going up and, on
balance, start going down.''
   ``This year all kinds of things went down: real estate, media,
banks, public stocks, private companies, you name it,'' Forbes
said.
   It said the declines ``reflected a general scaling down of
capital values, brought about in good part by a worldwide shrinkage
of credit and sinking stock markets.''
   That's not to say the wealthiest are hurting unbearably. The
estimated worth of the Forbes 400 totals $272.5 billion. That's
actually up $3.5 billion over last year's total, but the magazine
said the reason was its discovery of previously hidden sources of
wealth among some members of the list.
   Forty-three names were added to the list this year, meaning 43
old names came off. Six died, including the magazine's own namesake
Malcolm Forbes. The fortunes of 35 fell too far to be included.
   In addition, Alfred Dreyfus Goldman, Oklahoma City, with a 1989
real estate fortune estimated at $400 million, was removed from the
list because of an inheritance dispute with his brother. William
Barron Hilton was dropped because part of his 1989 total of $1.25
billion actually belongs to a foundation.
   As in 1989, the richest person on the list was John Werner
Kluge, 76, thrice-married entertainment entrepreneur who made his
$5.6 billion fortune by building up Metromedia Co., a wide-ranging
telecommunications company.
   No. 2 is Omaha investor Warren Buffett, 60, who bought his first
stock at age 11 and parlayed a savvy for picking stocks into a $3.3
billion fortune.
   Third is debt-financed takeover specialist Ronald O. Perelman,
47, a Wharton business school alumnus who borrowed money to build
an empire that ranges from the Revlon cosmetics company to Coleman
camping products to savings &amp; loans. Forbes pegged his worth at
$2.87 billion.
   More notable, however, were the people whose net worth tumbled.
The biggest victim was Sumner Murray Redstone, owner of the
entertainment giant Viacom International Inc., whose fortune
dropped from $2.88 billion to $2 billion.
   Others in the big-loser category included
publishing-entertainment baron Rupert Murdoch, whose fortune fell
by $600 million to $1.1 billion; cable TV mogul Ted Turner, whose
worth fell $460 million to $1.3 billion; and convicted Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond pioneer Milken, whose worth plunged
by $570 million to $700 million, largely because of $600 million in
criminal penalties and losses from Drexel's collapse early this
year.
   Among new names on the list, the wealthiest was Fred A. Lennon,
a highly secretive Ohio industrialist who made his $600 million
fortune selling valves and pipe fittings.
   The magazine said it based the figures on intensive research
into inheritances, stock ownership and what it called conservative,
common-sense estimates.
   Forbes has sought to make the 400 ranking its trademark, much
like arch-rival Fortune magazine has done with its annual ranking
of the 500 biggest U.S. industrial companies.

executive depicted here, but the author's rose-colored perspective is a bit 
hard to take. Trimble, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, often places 
problematic details in a positive light. He is little troubled, for example, by 
the tendency of new Wal-Marts to drive existing mom-and-pop stores out of 
business. It should be noted, too, that Walton never was America's richest man, 
Forbes magazine having failed for years to separate Sam's fortune from that of 
his family -- a fact this book's publisher conveniently glosses over. Chris

   Publisher Malcolm Stevenson Forbes, as
usual, made Forbes Magazine's list of the 400 richest people in
America, and as usual, he chose not to disclose his own wealth.
   Forbes has kept his net worth a closely guarded secret, and
aides to the publishing mogul contend that he may not even know
where he falls on the list.
   Saying no official wealth estimate is available, the magazine
has made him No. 113 on the list, between Laszlo Nandor Tauber,
worth $500 million, and John Thomas Lupton, worth $480 million.
   But really, how much is he worth?
   ``One thing I can say for sure, he's definitely worth between
$225 million and $6 billion,'' said Harold Seneker, a Forbes editor.
   Being publisher has its privileges for the Far Hills
million-or-billionaire. In short, he doesn't publish how much he's
worth because he doesn't have to.
   ``There is no (dollar figure) for him simply because he feels
it's his prerogative as owner of the magazine not to release his
net worth,'' said Forbes spokesman Ray Healey. ``He just chooses to
keep it to himself.''
   But really, how much is he worth?
   ``I don't think he even knows what it is and I don't think he's
in any hurry to have it figured out,'' said Don Garson, director of
corporate communications for Forbes.
   It would be unfair to Forbes to print his worth, Garson said,
because the dollar figures for the other 399 people listed are
presumed estimated, and Forbes' would be presumed factual since it
is his magazine.
   While the Oct. 24 issue includes outsiders' estimates of Forbes'
worth, they range dramatically. The London Daily Mail guesses $400
million, Newsday estimates his worth between $400 million and $700
million, and New York's Daily News simply says he's a
``billionaire.''
   In addition to Forbes Magazine, which his father launched in
1917, Forbes, 69, owns American Heritage magazine, Somerset Press,
a 400-square-mile Colorado ranch, a South Sea island, a London
mansion and a French chateau, among other holdings.

   Actor Robert Duvall has prepared himself for
roles by hanging out with bums on the Bowery, riding horses with
the Texas Rangers and tramping through a Louisiana swamp with an
alligator hunter.
   He's not sure if it was all worth it.
   ``You could do all the research in the world _ sometimes it pays
off, sometimes it doesn't,'' Duvall says in the March issue of
Smart magazine. ``Sometimes you don't have time. You got to be a
human being up there. That's the most important thing.''
   Duvall, who won an Oscar for ``Tender Mercies'' and starred in
``The Godfather'' and ``The Great Santini,'' says he's a stickler
for detail in his characters and in films in general.
   ``When actors start acting bigger than life, bigger than the
people they play, then they're in trouble,'' Duvall said. ``For
example, I can't even talk about `Gone With the Wind.' You don't
see people in the South like that. It's a joke.''

   Two queens, Elizabeth II and Beatrix, are Europe's
wealthiest women, although the English monarch with an estimated
personal fortune of $8.9 billion far outranks her Dutch
counterpart, a magazine said Sunday.
   Britian's Queen Elizabeth is the fourth richest person and the
richest woman in the world, reported Harpers and Queen magazine.
She has a jewelery collection including 25 crowns and tiaras,
racing horses, a valuable art collection and thousands of acres of
land and mineral rights worldwide.
   Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands weighed in at an estimated $4.7
billion.
   Johanna Quandt, who owns 66 percent of the West German
automotive company BMW, is Europe's third richest woman, the
magazine said. It estimated Ms. Quandt's fortune at $3.5 billion.
   Another German, Grete Schickedanz, owner of Quelle, Europe's
largest mail order company, is Europe's fourth wealthiest woman at
$2 billion, the magazine said.
   Athina Roussel, the 5-year-old daughter of the late shipping
heiress Christina Onassis and French pharmaceutical heir Thierry
Roussel, is No. 7 on the list, although Harpers and Queen said she
will not take control of her $840 million fortune until her 18th
birthday, in 2003.
   Forbes' list of the world's richest people published in October
listed Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who made his money in land,
railroads and resorts, as the world's richest individual worth
about $15 billion.
   The Sultan of Brunei and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia have been
reported by Fortune magazine to have more money at their personal
disposal because of the oil riches of their countries. Estimates of
the sultan's wealth have ranged up to $30 billion and Fahd's is
said to be in the $18 billion range.

   Comedian Milton Berle is selling his
longtime home here because it contains too many memories of his
late wife.
   ``I didn't have to sell the house,'' Berle said. ``But there are
too many memories there, you know, after being married 36 years.''
   The 81-year-old comic is negotiating to lease a penthouse on
Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles for $12,000 a month. The house
sold for more than $3 million cash to the owners of a mortgage
company.
   The 60-year-old home went on the block in October following the
death of Berle's wife, Ruth, in April. They had lived in the house
for 19 years.
   Berle had asked $3.65 million, but apparently the property needs
work.
   ``It has a lot of character but needs updating, and that's what
the buyers plan to do,'' said Yaffa Lerner, who sold the house.

   Pulitzer Prize winning author James
Michener has bought a summer home in Brunswick, and plans to move
there late this spring, a real estate broker says.
   ``He wanted to have access to a college library for research and
where it would be cool in the summer,'' said Brunswick broker
Deborah Morton.
   Michener, who has written such books as ``Hawaii,'' ``Alaska,''
``Caribbean'' and ``Space,'' began house hunting last fall and
found a condominium unit, but the deal was not closed until
Thursday, Ms. Morton said. She would not disclose the price.
   The 82-year-old author is known for his historical novels, which
combine history, geography and cultures of different regions. While
researching his books, Michener often moves to the area he is
writing about.

   Journalist Tony Brown told a
predominantly black audience that American blacks are crippled by a
self-imposed ``psychological slavery'' that keeps them from
achieving success.
   Brown said blacks are held captive by a myth: ``If white America
doesn't provide an opportunity for them, they won't have one.''
   ``You are psychologically dependent on someone else,'' Brown
told about 500 people at the annual fund-raising dinner of the
state chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People on Saturday night.
   Brown, host of the black affairs television series ``Tony
Brown's Journal,'' said the civil rights movement has brought
changes in laws that were needed to give blacks an equal footing.
   But it takes more than legislation to reverse a 200-year-old
mind-set of inferiority that plagues many in the black community,
Brown said. He urged blacks to take pride in their African identity
and not wait for others to help them reach their economic and
social goals.
   ``If we want to be equal, let's be equal,'' he said. ``We don't
need anybody to give us freedom.''
   Brown also writes a column that appears in 150 black newspapers,
publishes a quarterly magazine, and produces documentary films.

   In a state that has no limits on political
contributions, Douglas Wilder's campaign for governor of Virginia
is happy to have the support of John W. Kluge, named by Forbes
Magazine as the richest man in America.
   ``It's great,'' B.J. Northington, a Wilder campaign aide, said
Tuesday. ``He's given us, what, $200,000?'' Indeed, he has, in two
checks so far this year of $100,000 each. Kluge raised an
additional $500,000 for Wilder at a $5,000-a-couple get together at
his Charlottesville estate.
   But Northington was quick to say that Wilder's Republican
opponent, J. Marshall Coleman, has received more than $900,000 in
campaign contributions from McLean, Va., developer Dwight Schar and
his family.
   Big money is a hallmark of the campaign to succeed Virginia's
Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles, who cannot run for re-election.
   Coleman has raised more than $8 million and Wilder, bidding to
become the first black elected governor of any state, has taken in
close to $5 million. The election is Nov. 7.
   Money can be easy to raise in Virginia, too easy, according to
Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.
   ``We have no limitations in Virginia,'' he said. ``People can
give millions if they want.''
   Sabato defends political action committees as a preferred
alternative to individual contributions in the range of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
   ``They're making an investment,'' he said of such contributors.
``I've yet to find a person who believes the line they're doing it
for good government.''
   Alson Smith, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates who is
one of the state's premier political fund-raisers, said he
supported efforts to limit individual contributions to $1,000.
   ``We couldn't get that to fly,'' he said, adding that attempts
to set the limit at $5,000 and $10,000 were no more successful.
   Smith described Kluge as ``a good friend of mine'' and said,
``I've never asked him for a dime for anybody.''
   He said he thought Kluge was ``basically a Republican.''
   The 75-year-old Kluge is described as a self-made man who
parlayed a Maryland radio station into the Metromedia radio and
television empire.
   Forbes estimated his fortune at $5.2 billion and said his
holdings rose about $2 billion from the previous year thanks to a
tripling in the value of his investment in cellular telephones.
   He took the role of richest man in America from Sam Walton, head
of the Wal-Mart stores discount chain who dropped down on the
individual list because he divided his $9 billion fortune among
himself and his four children.
   Smith said Kluge and Wilder met when the billionaire had ``a
little mixer'' on his yacht.
   ``He started off without a dime,'' Smith said of Kluge. ``He
felt Doug Wilder had brought himself up by his bootstraps.''
   That prompted the first $100,000 check from Kluge to the Wilder
campaign. The story of the second check was told by Patricia Kluge
at the fund-raising reception at their estate.
   According to Mrs. Kluge, Coleman called her husband and said he
was aware of his support for Wilder but ``I'm going to win and I
think we should get to know each other.''
   Mrs. Kluge said that after that conversation her husband wrote
another $100,000 check to the Wilder campaign.
   What would Kluge's money buy if Wilder is elected governor?
   There has been widespread speculation that the billionaire's
wife yearns to sit on the University of Virginia Board of Visitors.
   Smith brushed off such suggestions, saying that given Kluge's
wealth, ``There's nothing Doug Wilder can do for John Kluge. What
can anybody do for John Kluge?''

   Wal-Mart Stores founder Sam Walton and family
saw the value of their stock lose more than $135 million last year
but they remained the wealthiest people in the United States, U.S.
News says.
   The Waltons of Bentonville, Ark., whose stores are fixtures in
small-town America, held $6.13 billion worth of stock in Wal-Mart,
keeping them atop the magazine's Richest 100 list for the third
time since the rankings began three years ago, U.S. News said in
its Aug. 1 editions.
   To make the list, an individual or family must own at least 5
percent of the shares of a publicly traded company. This is the
level the government considers large enough to influence management.
   In second spot again were Irenee and Edward du Pont and family
of Wilmington, Del., with $3.38 billion worth of the giant chemical
firm. U.S. News said the du Ponts kept the ranking despite a $1.3
billion loss in stock value in the year ending last March.
   David Packard, the computer pioneer from Los Altos Hills,
Calif., jumped from seventh spot in 1987 to third this year, with
$2.56 billion worth of holdings in Hewlett-Packard Co.
   No. 4 in the latest list were Carl Lindner and family of
Cincinnati, with $2.3 billion worth of holdings in food, financial
services, retailing and electronics firms. The Lindners were not in
the Top 10 last year.
   In fifth spot, up one from 1987, were John Dorrance Jr. and
family of Gladwyne, Pa., with $2.05 billion worth of the Campbell
Soup Co.
   Others in the Top 10 were Edgar and Charles Bronfman and family
of New York and Montreal, Seagram Co. Ltd., $1.88 billion; Sid,
Lee, Robert and Edward Bass of Ft. Worth, Texas, a variety of
holdings, $1.75 billion; Warren Buffett of Omaha, Neb., Berkshire
Hathaway, $1.64 billion; William Ford and family of Grosse Point
Shores, Mich., Ford Motor Co., $1.62 billion; and the Bancroft
family of New York, Dow Jones &amp; Co., $1.61 billion.
   U.S. News said the Bancrofts fell from third position in 1987
because of a $1.19 billion loss in stock value last year. It said
other stock-value losses included $859 million for the Bronfmans,
$510 million for the Dorrances and $320 million for the Lindners.
   U.S. News said the year's biggest money loser was Leslie Wexner
of Columbus Ohio, whose holdings in The Limited clothing stores
fell in value by $1.4 billion, or nearly 55 percent. Wexner was
ranked 17th among 18 billionaires on the list.

<HEAD>Discount Chain's Founder Undergoes Cancer Therapy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sam Walton, the 71-year-old founder of
the Wal-Mart discount chain empire, has undergone treatment for
bone-marrow cancer, a company spokesman said Thursday.
   Walton, once the richest person in America, has received two
sessions of chemotherapy and some radiation therapy since Sunday
for multiple myeloma, said Don Shinkle, a Wal-mart spokesman.
   Myeloma is a malignant tumor in the bone marrow. It is generally
made up of abnormal plasma cells.
   A Wal-Mart statement said Walton was expected to recover fully
from treatment he underwent in Houston at M.D. Anderson Hospital.
   It is the second time Walton has faced cancer. In 1982, he was
diagnosed as having leukemia and also was treated at M.D. Anderson.
The leukemia has been in remission for several years.
   ``Along with Mr. Sam's doctors, we are very encouraged that
because of early detection and treatment a full recovery is
expected,'' the statement said.
   ``His doctors have advised him that they have had good success
treating this type of cancer if it's detected in time,'' Shinkle
said. ``He's in very good spirits.''
   Shinkle said Walton probably would spend another couple of weeks
in Houston. ``The bottom line, we hear from the doctors, is that
they caught this in time, in the early stages,'' he said.
   Walton had experienced aches and pains for several months, but
felt better after the therapy, Shinkle said.
   ``I feel so much better already,'' Walton said in a two-page
memo to Wal-Mart employees.
   Shinkle said the memo was issued because Walton wanted employees
to hear news of his illness from him, ``rather than have them to
hear a lot of rumors, because many might be exaggerated or untrue.''
   Shinkle said Walton may be initially slowed down, but that he
expects to resume visiting outlets in a few weeks, a common Walton
practice. After this week's treatments, Walton visited a Sam's
Wholesale Club in Houston.
   Walton has been known to drop in on local Wal-Mart managers with
little advance notice to stay in touch with the retail business at
the customer level.
   The memo also described Wal-Mart accomplishments during the
1980s, which Walton credited to the employees of the chain's 1,300
stores. It said Walton looked forward to more success.
   Based on his holdings of Wal-Mart stock, Walton has been listed
for the past several years by Forbes magazine as one of the
wealthiest men in the nation. He was the wealthiest until he split
his stock among family members.
   Walton stepped down as chief executive officer of the retail
chain in 1988, and chose David Glass to oversee the chain.
   The chain blossomed under Walton's philosophy of tight
management and general marketing principles that the customer is
always right.
   Born in Kingfisher, Okla., Walton grew up as the son of a
farm-mortgage banker. He graduated from the University of Missouri
with an economics degree in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a
management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa. After serving three years
in the Army, he went to Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin
five-and-dime. In 1962, Sam and his brother James L. Walton, opened
the first Wal-Mart Discount City.
   Three of his four grown children are involved with the company
in various capacities.

MADE IN AMERICA: MY STORY
By Sam Walton
Doubleday, Dollars 22.50. 269 pages
Being an American folk hero is a tricky assignment, as Ross Perot found out.
The problem is that the great American public likes its boot-strap
entrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright. In a country where business
practices are not overly genteel, this is a tough combination to achieve. A
vast media circus, meanwhile, is quick to expose any flaws.
Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart chain of discount supermarkets who died
of cancer in April, negotiated these pitfalls much better than most. When,
in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, the
paparazzi descended on the obscure corner of Arkansas, mainly occupied by
chicken farmers, where Walton made his home. What they found was a happily
married, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted at
the local Holiday Inn, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus two
hub-caps. Folksy was an understatement.
Since then, some aspects of Wal-Mart's business - its anti-union policies,
the impact of its Dollars 40bn annual sales on hundreds of Mom-and-Pop shops
 -have been subject to critical scrutiny. So, to an extent, have the less
wholesome adventures of the four Walton children. But no one has ever been
able to make Sam himself look bad. The worst that has been said is that he
was rather dull.
Walton is not about to dash anyone's illusions. Readers will either find his
autobiography lashed with 'good ol'' common-sense and a lot of harmless, if
charming, anecdotes. Or they will find it dreary and downbeat. Walton makes
no excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring to most you,' he writes at one
stage, 'but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate .
. . .'
A few snippets are more revealing about the character. There cannot be many
billionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - and
have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point.
Meanwhile, the competitive energy which Sam Walton applied to his business
is inescapable. In one of many contributions from friends and family, Don
Soderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tells of finding Sam one
Saturday morning on his hand and knees at the local Kmart store, analysing
his rival's stock. And his wife, in a casual aside, notes that when the
couple was on holiday in Italy their luggage vanished while her husband was
off on a similar scouting mission.
But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhaps
captures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best. Explaining the annual
contest in which Wal-Mart executives choose one 'volume producing item' to
promote, he recalls the time Sam (who usually won) selected minnow buckets
for carrying bait. Glass was more happily teamed with apple juice. 'So I
would go down to the stores, and get them to take that minnow bucket . . .
put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnow
bucket. I particularly did it in stores I knew (Sam) was going to visit. It
drove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'
But the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the
truth. Sam Walton was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packaged
himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern
sweet called Moon Pies.
For the most part, this makes for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.
Occasionally, it just grates. 'I had bought a bank in Bentonville, for about
about Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, for example, 'just a little old bank
with only about Dollars 3.5m in deposits. But it helped me learn a lot about
financing things.' Oh, come on Sam, is that the whole story?
The real truth, one suspects, comes right at the end of the book - when
Walton admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have written
this book'. Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday paid about Dollars
4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he
can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it. But these are unlikely to be
circumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis. At the end of
the day, Sam Walton's heritage is in the shopping malls, not the bookstores.

<TEXT>
   The store manager of the Wal-Mart in this
community on the outskirts of Dallas tells a story that gives an
insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing
phenomenon.
   Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary
telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters in
Bentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton was about to land at a nearby
airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring
him to the De Soto store.
   Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in
close touch with everyday goings-on. His example is followed by
other Wal-Mart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of
time in the field.
   Says Ed Nagy, district manager for 9 stores in the Dallas
metropolitan area, ``It's not like `Uh-oh, someone's coming,'
because they're always out.''
   By all accounts, Sam Walton's personality permeates operations
throughout the company.
   Everyone, from Wal-Mart President and Chief Operating Officer
David Glass down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the
gospel according to Sam, as he is called.
   To paraphrase Sam's primary rules of retailing, ``Rule No.1 is
the customer is always right. Rule No.2 says just in case the
customer's wrong, revert to rule No.1.''
   If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they are
because that's the way Sam is, people who know him say.
   He shuns the limelight that his company's success has shed on him
and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews.
   He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though.
   He also regularly reminds Wal-Mart ``associates'' that
hospitality to customers is crucial. He preaches it in person or via
high-tech satellite hookup with his stores.
   Wal-Mart employees became known as associates under a company
effort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a union
organizing effort in the late 1960s.
   One of the most sensitive subjects for Walton is the fortune he's
amassed.
   A close associate says Sam would ``probably give anything'' not
to be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiest
people. The magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stake
in Wal-Mart stock is worth about $6.8 billion.
   ``Sam Walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in his
bank account,'' says Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart spokesman.
   Samuel Moore Walton turns 71 on March 29. He was born in
Kingfisher, Okla., and grew up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker.
   He graduated from the University of Missouri with an economics
degree in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a management trainee in
Des Moines, Iowa. After serving three years in the Army, he went to
Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventually
becoming the company's biggest franchisee.
   The seeds of the Wal-Mart empire were sown when Sam and his
brother James L., or Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in
1962. The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of U.S.
retail trade.
   Bud is a senior vice president and board member of Wal-Mart.
Three of the four grown children Sam and his wife Helen had are
involved with the company in various capacities.
   Sam hasn't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much as
ever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with
leukemia, now in remission. He spends less time in the office since
handing over most responsiblities to David Glass. Sam is still
chairman of the board.
   Glass doesn't hesitate when asked if Wal-Mart can flourish
without Sam. The answer is an emphatic yes because, he says, ``We
have great people.'' The Walton family will always be involved, he
adds.
   Commenting on the future, Glass says: ``We'll be judged on what
we produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done in the past won't
matter.''

AMERICA'S RICH GETTING POORER IN 1990

Forbes magazine released its annual list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people 
today, spelling out what some have suspected with glee for months: Donald Trump 
has hit very hard times, and he's not the only high-flier who crashed with the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
While the flashy developer was dropped right off the Forbes 400 list, 
Metromedia founder John Kluge grew even richer. 
</P>
<P>
The rags-to-riches German expanded his fortune by $400 million, to a staggering 
$5.6 billion, enough to retain his crown as the richest of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the top 400 saw their net worth dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
"With the end of the great 1980s credit binge, capital values almost everywhere 
are being marked down. Just as homeowners feel less wealthy than a year ago, so 
do most of the nations' rich," the magazine said. "In 1990 the rich have been 
getting poorer. 
</P>
<P>
"Trump is the most noteworthy loser," it said. "Once a billionaire, Trump's net 
worth may actually have dropped to zero." 
</P>
<P>
Another loser is Merv Griffin, whose Resorts International, which owns the 
struggling casino next door to Trump's struggling Taj Mahal, went bankrupt.
