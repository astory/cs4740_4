In the World Series of Birding, people do the migrating. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to identify as many birds as possible in 24 hours, five-person teams 
came to New Jersey for a weekend in May to cough like a clapper rail and squint 
through binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
A team sponsored by Carl Zeiss Optical in Alexandria, Va., captured the seventh 
annual birdwatching title by identifying 210 birds after racing over 490 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop! Please stop! Please stop the van!" shouted Julie Zickefoose, a bird 
illustrator from Hadlyme, Conn. "There's a tern hovering." 
</P>
<P>
The group identified the bird within 10 seconds and shouted: "Drive on." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have time to enjoy the bird," said Rick Radis, a writer from 
Denville, N.J., who was on the winning team. "It was: 'There's a stilt 
sandpiper. Let's get back in the car.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the New Jersey Audubon Society, the contest began at 12:01 a.m. 
and ended the following midnight. The teams frantically crisscrossed hundreds 
of miles of New Jersey from pinelands to shore marsh. 
</P>
<P>
Most started in northwestern New Jersey, relying on their ability to hear birds 
in the morning darkness. With daylight came a southward migration of 
birdwatchers, who hit the New Jersey shore tired but eager by midday. The 
competition ended on the tip of New Jersey's southern shore in Cape May, a 
haven for migratory birds on their Atlantic flyway. 
</P>
<P>
The state attracts a variety of birds because of its varying terrain of 
coastline, small mountains and pinelands. Its location between Canada and the 
southern United States also makes it possible to find birds from those areas. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny and windy afternoon -- wind hampers birdcalls -- the "birders" 
descended on the Edwin Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge in Oceanville, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The vans make their own formation by rumbling slowly along a dirt road until 
someone sights or hears a new bird species. 
</P>
<P>
Teams operate on the honor system, and all members are required to have seen or 
heard the bird for it to be marked off. Five percent of the birds do not have 
to be identified by all members. This year, 253 birds were identified by the 35 
teams. The clapper rail was heard but not seen. 
</P>
<P>
Would a birder lie? 
</P>
<P>
"It's the last of the honor sports," said Peter Alden, a tour group leader from 
New York City who has visited more than 100 countries and seen more than 5,000 
bird species. "But you could have lied through your teeth, gotten up at 11 in 
the morning and figured out what you could have seen." 
</P>
<P>
Alden and Zickefoose's group, which also included actress Jane Alexander, 
didn't seem like the lying kind. Bird identification books littered their van, 
and three hours of travel with them showed their love for mastering the coughs 
that will draw out a clapper rail and for whipping out binoculars fast enough 
to spot a snowy egret. 
</P>
<P>
The team ended up counting 168 birds, finishing 18th. 
</P>
<P>
For the weekend at least, the camaraderie disappeared between birders who 
ordinarily would gladly show another that barn owl in the refuge's 
pewter-colored waters set against the casino skyline of Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, everybody kind of laughs at the bird you didn't get," 
said Alf Wilson, co-owner of a Walpole, Mass.-based company putting out a bird 
identification video. 
</P>
<P>
Then he grew silent and cupped his ears while his teammates coughed, trying to 
attract the elusive clapper rail. 
</P>
<P>
As for the winners, they credited their victory to 500 hours of advance 
scouting and simple birders' luck at bird-spotting or "getting on the bird." 
</P>
<P>
For example, they found a red crossbill in northern New Jersey even though the 
migratory bird is not usually found in the state in spring or summer. 
</P>
<P>
And members of the winning team -- who got a team trophy and a pair of 
binoculars apiece -- said they celebrated their victory by getting a jump on 
next year's scouting. They got up early the next day and spotted a Mississippi 
kite. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for enjoyment, but it's more of a game," Radis said.

FREMONT FLYWAY; An elegant blue heron takes off from Duck Island in Lake
Elizabeth, home to more than 125 species of birds and mammals. The lake draws
birds because it lies along the Pacific flyway. But lately, politics are
ruffling the waters. The Bay Area Rapid Transit District plans to build a rail
extension either over the lake or near it. The Fremont City Council is urging
BART to change its route, but so far BART has refused.(color); PHOTO:

<LEADPARA>  As a blustery wind pelted rain against her face, Judy Felber navigated the
small powerboat around the back of Duck Island in Lake Elizabeth. She cut the
motor, and as the boat rocked through the choppy water, pointed to the birds
on shore.;    "There's a black crown night heron," Felber said, gesturing
toward a large bird hidden in the bushes. "They are nocturnal, so they don't
do a lot in the daylight. At night they go to the edge of the shore and feed
on fish or frogs or whatever they can find."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AT TIMES, FREMONT LAKE IS FOR THE BIRDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     As a park and animal services officer for the city of Fremont, Felber makes
trips around the lake frequently. She and members of her staff go out at least
once a day to check the water level and make sure the birds are not disturbed.
They also count the birds on the lake once a week.;    But lately, politics
has disturbed the lake's tranquility. The Bay Area Rapid Transit District
plans to build a rail extension from downtown Fremont to Warm Springs, and the
plans call for the trains to run either over the lake or near it. The Fremont
City Council is urging BART to tunnel trains under Lake Elizabeth, but so far
BART has refused.;    As part of its strategy to show BART that trains will
damage Lake Elizabeth and Central Park, the city council is emphasizing the
area's wildlife. When the BART Board of Directors came to Fremont recently to
tour the park, they saw a professionally produced video commercial for the
lake. Felber was featured prominently in the video, giving a tour of the
wildlife.;    Since the 80-acre lake sits in a major metropolitan area, many
people aren't aware it is home to more than 125 species of birds and mammals,
Felber said. Yet birds flock to the lake because it lies along the Pacific
flyway, and it is one of the few open bodies of fresh water around.;    Winter
is a particularly good time to see birds because there are few people around,
Felber said. And since no one is allowed on Duck Island, the birds tend to
congregate there to nest and eat.;    In the winter, "there are less people in
the park, " Felber said. "There's less danger for the birds. It's quiet, it's
protected. There's plenty of food here.";    As soon as Felber spotted one
black crowned night heron, she began to see more crouched among the branches
of barren trees, their feathers fluffed to keep warm. There are about 26
herons in the park, out of a bird population of about 2,500.;    Suddenly, a
great blue heron walked into a small clearing on the island. It lifted its
feet one at a time to its chest, as if trying to keep them warm. But as
Felber's boat drew closer, the blue heron spooked and flew into the air. With
its six-foot wingspan, the bird was gone in a few seconds.;    No one knows
exactly how BART trains might affect the bird habitat. There are railroad cars
that run near the lake, but their noise is muffled. In the video, Felber
pointed out that birds do not like loud noises, and expressed concern that
BART trains might scare them away.  </TEXT>

   Health officials are employing
psychological warfare in a nearly decade-long battle against
thousands of noisy starlings that descend in dense flocks each
summer in certain elm-lined neighborhoods.
   The birds keep people awake, coat cars in messy droppings and
make Bob Mathis' life miserable each summer.
   Mathis, the village's environmental health supervisor, has tried
everything over the years from wind machines to huge balloons
painted with ``terror eyes'' to resemble owls.
   He had limited success until he hit on a promising combination
two or three years ago of high-intensity search lights and a taped
starling distress call that fills the evening air with screeching
to scare away the birds.
   ``We use a physical assault and psychological warfare,'' he
said. ``The lights unsettle their environment and the starling
distress call is an eerie sound, like a bird being strangled.''
   For seven years or more in the warmer months, the birds in
flocks of 3,000 to 5,000 seem to favor the cathedral-arch canopies
of elms on two usually quiet blocks in this Chicago suburb.
   The birds feast on beetles and caterpillars by day and head for
the trees at dusk for their evening shut-eye.
   Residents call the kids inside and park their cars down the
block, away from the splatter of bird droppings.
   ``It's a real mess here,'' one resident, Ken Radnitzer, said
Wednesday night, during one of Mathis' regular trips to the
neighborhood with the lights and distress call.
   ``It's a health hazard,'' said another, Kathleen Dawson. ``The
droppings get so bad that if you're out in the evening and your kid
is in bare feet you're forever running after him. Or in the back
yard, the droppings get on the toys.''
   John Jones said he doesn't need an alarm clock in the summer.
   ``At 4, 5, 6 o'clock in the morning the birds start up,'' he
said. ``They'll take care of waking you up.''
   When the village first went after the birds, it suspended
balloons 6 feet around above trees. The balloons had reflective
``terror eyes'' stuck on, but the balloons blew away in wind storms
and the approach was abandoned.
   Wind machines were tried with little success. Ultimately,
Mathis, who doesn't want to kill the birds or tamper with the
trees, settled on the lights and taped screeches.
   The method chases the birds off the blocks under siege, but they
come back eventually or bother some other block. But Mathis isn't
ready to give up on the technique.
   ``You just have to be persistent,'' he said. ``It's a question
of who can last the longest and the Health Department so far is
keeping up with the birds.''
   Starlings, native to Europe, were first released in New York's
Central Park in 1890. Two earlier attempts to introduce the birds
to North America failed, but this one succeeded in a big way.
   Like the settlers before them, the starlings headed west and
reached the Pacific in 60 years. Now they occupy nearly every nook
and cranny of North America, numbering an estimated 200 million.

   La Canada Flintridge, Calif., might gladly trade its peacocks for a few New York pigeons. 

   The birds of beautiful plumage are Public Enemy No. 1 in the fashionable residential community in the hills northeast of Los Angeles. 
At a City Council meeting earlier this week, many of the 100 citizens present were there to demand that something be done about the wild fowl. 

   The birds, which bred in the wild after escaping captivity years ago, are charged with damaging property, creating a public nuisance, and other behavior unbecoming to a peacock. 

   Peacocks, native to India, were originally brought to Southern California to decorate the estates of the rich and famous. 
La Canadans say the particular birds in their community are descendants of peacocks imported mainly to help rid a local ranch of rattlesnakes. 

   Generally the La Canadans and peacocks got along until 1984, when a brush fire drove away the wild birds' primary predators, coyotes. 
As the peacock population grew, however -- to an estimated 100 to 150 in La Canada today -- their popularity plummeted. 

   Virginia M. Gram, 49 years old, says the birds continually wreak havoc in her back yard. 
"They eat everything and drop messes like a small dog," says the lifelong resident. 
Their daily diet: Mrs. Gram's lobelias, sweet williams and alyssums. 

   Donald B. Moser, 68, adds that the birds' crowing sounds "like a woman screaming, but only 10 times louder." 

   The birds also set off burglar alarms on occasion by pecking at their reflections in glass doors, says La Canada Mayor Joan C. Feehan. 

   Several suggestions surfaced at the City Council meeting on how to resolve the problem. 
Walter R. Brant, a retired mechanical engineer, had a simple plan: "Just trap 'em with a snare, chop their head off, pluck 'em, clean 'em and stuff 'em." 

   Some compassion for the birds also was voiced. 
One resident suggested the peacock be named the official town bird to protect it from harm. 
And Susan Myers, identifying herself as "pro-peacock," recommended that residents put the birds to use by serving peacock eggs for breakfast. 
"I hear they're delicious," she said. 

   After more than two hours of discussion, the council instead decided to provide residents with live traps and to help relocate the birds to a nearby animal refuge.

<TEXT>     She called the Humane Society of Santa Clara Valley to come and take the
peacock away, but it only rescues sick or injured animals or accepts them if
someone brings them in.;    The peacock showed up Wednesday morning on Ariel
Drive near Snell Avenue, hopping from roof to roof and from car to car.
There's no evidence it is related to the peahen that has taken up residence
around Third and San Carlos streets in downtown San Jose.;    Flock at
cemetery;  Pollard thought her neighborhood bird might have wandered away from
Oak Hill Cemetery, where a flock of about 100 peacocks live, and used the
right of way for Highways 87 and 85 to get to South San Jose.;    But Doris
Bowdle, a spokeswoman for Oak Hill, doesn't think it's one of theirs.;    The
cemetery's peacocks usually just hop the fence and wander onto Curtner Avenue
or into a nearby mobile home park, she said. "They do come back or someone
brings them back," she said.;    Oak Hill's peacocks, descendents of a pair
given to the cemetery nearly half a century ago, are fed by cemetery employees
and are "pretty tame," Bowdle said.;    The peahen who lives downtown seems to
have adapted well to the busy intersection she has called home for about five
months.;    After a story about her appeared in the Mercury News a month ago,
Diane McCown, manager of a nearby Kinko's, received some calls suggesting
places the peahen could live -- but someone would have to get her there. No
one has explained just how that might be done -- they are large birds -- so
the peahen continues to live in her adopted home.;    Peacocks love to preen;
Pollard, worried about the children who will be playing outdoors now that the
weather is warmer, hopes her visitor won't be quite so flexible.;    The birds
love reflection, and spend a lot of time preening in front of anything that
they can see an image of themselves in.;    Sue Howell, a wildlife specialist
with the Youth Science Institute, said peacocks are not native to the Santa
Clara Valley and any of the birds wandering around probably are someone's
pet.;    The recent storms disrupted a lot of animals, she said. And, it's the
mating season, a time when animals and birds might be expected to wander.;   
In any case, she said, peacocks "are very difficult to capture."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Mystery Solved: The Wishbone Is a Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard scientist wanting to know why birds have
wishbones believes he has found the answer.
   ``The wishbone turns out to be a spring,'' said Farish A.
Jenkins, of Harvard's biology department.
   In a report published today in the journal Science, Jenkins
described a new way of studying the inner mechanics of birds in
flight by taking movies of them with X-ray cameras. And he detailed
his first discovery with this tool _ the function of the wishbone.
   At the University of Pittsburgh, researcher Robert Raikow was as
impressed by the possibilities of X-ray movies as he was by their
initial revelation.
   ``It's a pioneering new method of studying birds,'' he said.
``We can actually see the movement of the skeletal elements during
flight. That's pretty exciting.''
   Jenkins and two colleagues, Kenneth P. Dial of Harvard and
George E. Goslow Jr. of Northern Arizona University, took X-ray
films of starlings flying in place against 20-45 mph winds in a
wind tunnel.
   The movies allowed the scientist to look at the birds' insides
and see how the various bones work during flight.
   Until now, researchers have tried to figure out such functions
by looking at the skeletons of dead birds or the outsides of live
ones.
   In their report, the researchers described the way the wishbone
bends each time a bird flaps its wings. At rest, the upper ends of
the starling's wishbone are 11 or 12 millimeters apart. But when
the wings descend, that distance stretches to 18 to 20 millimeters.
   Just why it bends this way is not clear. Jenkins said the spring
doesn't seem to help the bird beat its wings more efficiently.
Instead, he theorized that it helps the bird breathe in more air
during flight so it can burn the extra energy it needs to stay
aloft.
   When a bird breathes, air flows first into air sacs scattered
throughout its body and then into its lungs. Among these sacs is
one between the two arms of the wishbone.
   The researchers speculate that as the bird beats its wings
downward, the wishbone spreads apart, opening the air sac so it
fills with air. Then, on the upswing, the bird's sternum squeezes
the air out again.
   ``What we suspect is that there is an alternating bellows
mechanism drawing air in and out of the sac and possibly in and out
of the lung,'' said Jenkins.
   Not all birds have wishbones _ hummingbirds and some parrots are
among the exceptions _ but Jenkins believes that the starling's
wishbone spring is typical of most feathered creatures, including
the turkey.
   Until now, scientists had assumed that the bone was simply a
strut between the bird's shoulders. However, Jenkins conceded that
the wishbone's springiness is obvious to Thanksgiving Day wish
makers.
   ``This is well known to everybody in the world,'' he said.
``It's only scientists who discover the obvious.''

NESTING PLATFORMS: For more than 10 years, great blue herons have nested in 
eucalyptus trees at the Santa Ana River Lakes in Anaheim. The "lakes," site of 
a fishing concession, are recharge basins controlled by the Orange County Water 
District near where Tustin Avenue crosses the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 14 nests produced 12 great blue heron chicks. And once the herons 
finished nesting, double-crested cormorants used the same nests and 
successfully raised young. Five nests produced 11 cormorant chicks, the first 
time the birds are known to have nested in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, increased nesting activity and perhaps other environmental factors 
have damaged the trees. In an effort to protect the bird habitat, artificial 
nesting structures will be built at the site by the County Environmental 
Management Agency, with advice from the state Fish and Game Department. 
</P>
<P>
Erection of four nesting poles, each with three platforms, was to be completed 
in February but was delayed by a paper-work mix-up, according to Dale Dillon of 
the county environmental agency. His agency could put up the poles within two 
weeks, but that may be too late: herons at the site have already started to 
collect materials to reinforce nests from past seasons and will be laying eggs 
in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Burkett, a biologist for Fish and Game who is advising on the project, 
said erection of the poles may have to wait until next year if she decides the 
project will disturb the nesting birds too much. Whether the poles go up or not 
this year, the damaged trees will remain for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
Burkett believes this is the first time in California that nesting structures 
of this type will be tried for great blue herons, although they have been used 
successfully in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana River Lakes site is the largest of several known great blue heron 
rookeries in the county (the rookeries are small, with only 24 to 30 total 
nests known in the county). Others include a few nests on an island in Anaheim 
Lake, some at undeveloped Wagon Wheel Regional Park, and at Irvine Lake. 
</P>
<P>
SPEAKING OF BIRDS: Among the rare bird-sightings reported in January by Doug 
Willick, who compiles the sightings for American Bird magazine, is a pine 
warbler spotted at Yorba Regional Park on Jan. 14 and presumed to be wintering 
there. A common bird of the Eastern pine forests, this marks the first time the 
pine warbler has been recorded in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
An immature bald eagle spotted flying through Upper Newport Bay on Jan. 29 was 
only the second recorded sighting in the county in more than 10 years. 
Historically, the bird wintered in the county in small numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The American white pelicans that descended on the east Anaheim area in 
unprecedented numbers (several hundred were counted) peaked in December and 
have been gradually leaving the area. Several dozen of the impressive birds 
remain and are often seen in the Santa Ana River Lakes area.

BREEDING BIRD: WHITE-THROATED SWIFT (AERONAUTES SAXATALIS) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Description: Easily recognizable from other North American swifts by its white 
underparts and contrasting black side patches below the wings. Length is six to 
seven inches. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Breeds mainly on coastal cliffs and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Aerial foraging, captures flying insects. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Mate in flight; pairs tumble together end-over-end as they copulate. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Built deep inside crack or crevice of a canyon wall; feathers glued 
together and to wall with saliva. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Creamy white, unmarked; four-fifths of an inch in length. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation: Site tenacity (a tendency to return to nest site or breeding 
colony) has been disrupted by increased housing development on coastal cliffs 
and canyon areas, forcing swifts to nest in cracks of building walls. 
</P>
<P>
Voice: High-pitched jejejejejeje, in descending tones. 
</P>
<P>

FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: A beautiful swamp - James Henderson enjoys the
wildlife of Trinidad's Caroni mangrove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took some persuasion to convince me that a trip to a swamp would be the
highlight of my visit to Trinidad. What do you do in 40 square miles of
mangrove and sumptuous black mud? But James Madoo was a salesman who loved
his subject, and I did not reckon with the depth of mystery and the variety
of the Caroni swamp.
Trinidad has an extraordinary variety of birdlife (more than 400 species) in
its 1,800 square miles of coastal swamps, plains and forested mountains.
'Iere,' the old Indian name for Trinidad, meant 'Land of the Hummingbird,'
and there are 16 species on the island.
Aerodynamically they have about as much chance of flying as a helicopter. In
their efforts to keep airborne they must beat their wings about 50 times a
second. Their metabolic rate is so high that they must constantly top up
with nectar. At night, hummingbirds switch off and become stiff as a wooden
board.
Trinidad lies on a migratory route and so, not unlike the tourists,
thousands of birds flock there from the US and Canada each year to avoid the
northern winter. Many other species have spilled over from South America,
just seven miles away. These are truly exotic, adorned with bright tropical
colours and quirks of nature that only their mates could possibly find
attractive.
Some are designed for perfect flying, with built-in aerofoils and spoilers;
others are lumbered with ridiculous encumbrances. The poor wattled jacana
has silly-looking, overlong toes and an embarrassing red splurge on its
face. And just imagine having the bill of a toucan.
The diminutive male white bearded mannikin spends 90 per cent of its waking
hours displaying itself. It flits backwards and forwards, all to entice
female mannikins to its court. Deeper in the rain forest there is a bird
that strikes up chucka-chucka-chucka-chucka, like an unsuccessful
starter-motor, and another that calls boing, boing . . . boing. Heaven knows
what a violaceous trogon does back at the nest.
Of all the mournful, sceptical, quizzical-looking birds you see on the
island, the most majestic is the scarlet ibis, and it was this I went to see
in Caroni swamp. I travelled by mini-bus, or, as the contrary Trinidadians
prefer to call it, a maxi-taxi - more a mobile discotheque than a bus. The
carnival rhythms pumped relentlessly on, but soon the bustle of Port of
Spain receded and the overwhelming greens of the Trinidad countryside loomed
around us.
At the swamp I met Winston Nanan, a stocky and quietly-spoken man. His
knowledge of Trinidadian wildlife is encyclopaedic. He began by telling us
of the swamp and its fragile ecosystem, of the 168 species of bird that can
be seen there and of the efforts being made to protect them. Anecdotes,
including hair-raising stories of disturbing armed poachers, were drawn from
30 years of swamp life.
We set off into the mangroves. James Madoo accelerated the outboard for a
moment and then left the boat to cruise as we listened. Suddenly, with a
splash, a spectacled cayman pushed off into the water and cruised away with
lazy movements of its tail.
A mangrove tree can cover whole acres. It is an endless tangle of brown
roots, sprouting willy-nilly from the mud, miniature flying buttresses run
riot topped with bushy leaves.
As we crept into each new spot, the favoured haunt of a particular species,
the peace would take a moment to return, but soon the birds would appear.
With a cock of the head the guides held our attention.
The swamp started to come alive. A white-necked heron stood perched on one
foot in a stretch of open water, shoulders hunched and immobile, as it had
been for hours (except occasionally to change legs), waiting to strike for
food. Skulking around the edge, a green-backed heron preferred to stalk,
holding its body horizontal over the water.
A lonesome boop-boop-boop rang out - a clapper rail - and a second later a
little character with a spiked haircut (called topknot) flitted past with a
grating hiss: a yellow-bellied elaenia. It fled shamelessly at the
appearance of a fearsome tiger heron. Suddenly, the wattled jacana's
rebellious toes made sense - they were perfect for keeping balance over
lilies.
As evening drew in we made our way to the scarlet ibis sanctuary. Moments
later the first pair breezed in, a flash of red as they flapped and landed.
Scarlet ibises are gregarious creatures, and as many as 5,000 return
nightly, after feeding in Venezuela, to roost in the mangroves.
The ibises are impossibly red, the strongest scarlet, like a British
postbox. The colour derives from the chemical carotin, which they find in
the little crustaceans in the swamp. They stand about 3ft high, with wings
3ft when outstretched; their 8in bills curve downwards.
For a while, as well as being Trinidad's national bird, the scarlet ibis was
also something of a national dish, and in the 1960s numbers were dangerously
low (they were also hunted for their feathers). Away from their own
environment, or in captivity, ibis fade to a dull pink, a wan reminder of
the real thing. Now that they have some protection in the sanctuary, they
have returned to the swamp to roost and have started to breed again.
The mating season lasts from the end of April into June, when you will see
pairs flying high, descending in ever- decreasing circles before they
disappear behind a curtain of mangrove leaves. Nesting lasts until August.
Soon there were 50 ibis in the air at a time, gliding in above us.
Momentarily a tree would burst aflame as they stretched their wings to the
full, flapping and settling. In the golden evening light the mangroves,
flecked white with the cattle egrets, took on a deep scarlet glow.
But it faded with the dusk. The oysters on the mangrove roots snapped shut
for the night and we returned home.

<HEAD>Birdwatchers Begin Holiday Bird Tally Of Western Hemisphere</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three ruddy-cheeked people - burs stuck
in their clothes, snorting steam in the cold dawn - come hissing
and warbling out of the woods.
   But there's no need to flee - they're part of the National
Audubon Society's 91st annual Christmas Bird Count, in which bird
watchers across North and South America began their tallies
Saturday.
   When it ends Jan. 2, 42,000 birdwatchers will have counted
upwards of 100 million birds.
   It doesn't seem so large when you watch a tiny piece of it, such
as the count along the Hudson River in the hamlet of Newton Hook,
about 100 miles north of New York City.
   ``Robins, four robins across the river,'' calls Becky Holberton,
one of three counters scanning the river with telescopes and
binoculars.
   ``Waterfowl on the flat!'' she cries moments later.
   ``Good spotting,'' answers her companion, Richard Guthrie.
``Canada geese.''
   Earlier, Guthrie stood in a barn tugging on a rope from the
roof, trying to flush out roosting birds.
   ``I see rock doves,'' called Kathy Schneider, the third counter,
waiting outside to see what birds flew out. ``And you're scaring
the daylights out of them.''
   The annual count ``is a good indicator of the health of our
environment,'' said Holberton, an ornithology student at the State
University of New York at Albany.
   When populations dwindle, it generally means human development
is destroying birds' habitats, as in the destruction of tropical
rain forests in South America, she said.
   ``We'd all like to point our fingers at South and Central
America without worrying about the destruction in our own
backyards,'' Holberton said. ``But we really can't do that anymore.
It's a global problem.''
   Birdwatching teams will cover birds in about 1,600 zones, each
15 miles in diameter, counting as many birds as they can in one
day. The results will be published next year in American Birds, a
National Audubon journal.
   The counts began in 1900, when environmentalists rebelled
against Christmas hunting competitions, said Geoff LeBaron,
Christmas Bird Count editor at American Birds. Conservationist
Frank Chapman countered with a plan to ``count the birds rather
than try to shoot them,'' LeBaron said.

BIRDERS TALLY TEALS, LOONS AND THE LIKE IN ANNUAL RITUAL

Loren Hays had been in bed for hours when most people were just starting to 
celebrate New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
His sleep was important. He got up in the darkness Sunday morning, made his way 
toward the coastal wetlands and waited for the sun to rise so he could look 
through a telescope and spot such species as the double-crested cormorant, 
northern shoveler, blue-winged teal, common loon and the long-billed dowitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Hays, a biologist at Cal State Long Beach and for the federal government, 
gathered with his wife, Debra, and five others, including Department of Fish 
and Game wildlife biologist Esther Burkett, for an annual bird count in a 
small, rain-soaked parking lot at the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve near 
Pacific Coast Highway just south of Huntington Harbour. 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas season count, conducted throughout the country by members of the 
Audubon Society, collects valuable data on bird numbers and habitats. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun made its first appearance of the day, about the time many New Year's 
Eve revelers went to bed, Hays' group fanned out over the state Department of 
Fish and Game's wetland reserve to count birds. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups met at other places along the coast to count birds and gather 
information about species. One group group went by boat to make its count 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to have bird shoots around Christmas," Hays said. "They would go out 
and blast everything in sight. In the late '40s or early '50s, someone decided 
that counting the birds might be a better alternative than shooting them." 
</P>
<P>
So each year, members of the Audubon Society and others, who like to call 
themselves birders, go out and count the birds. There are two counts each year, 
one inland and one along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the information that is gathered during the counts is now used as a 
scientific database," Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
The counters carry official tally sheets that list about 180 species of birds. 
</P>
<P>
The advanced birder in each counting group -- in this case Hays -- peers 
through a telescope scanning the wetlands for the birds. Hays called out their 
names as he found them. 
</P>
<P>
It went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
"Five northern harriers. Thirty-five long-billed dowitchers. Thirty-five common 
loon. One bufflehead and twelve northern pintail." 
</P>
<P>
As Hays rattled off the names, Debbie Hays thumbed through the pages to find 
the species and note the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"A red-breasted merganser. A pied-billed grebe. Two surf scoters and an 
American coot." 
</P>
<P>
Then the group moved to a new position. Hays began his search again. He looked 
around the estuary for birds. When he found them, he called out their species 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Hays did not need a book to identify the birds found Sunday. Asked how many 
species he could identify by sight, he modestly replied, "Less than a 
thousand." 
</P>
<P>
Last year was a particularly good one for the coastal counters. They spotted 
214 species, the second highest count in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll come close to that this year," Hays said. "Many of the 
mountain birds are not here this year." 
</P>
<P>
Counting birds is not an easy job, and prospective counters are warned ahead of 
time about the long hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, every daylight hour counts," warned a newsletter for the Sea &amp; 
Sage Audubon Society, a local chapter. "One year, rough-winged swallows, 
northern water thrushes, lesser nighthawks and western screech owls were all 
found as the sun was setting or later. That means four species would have been 
missed if counters had quit early." 
</P>
<P>
"It is the world's greatest hobby, and I've tried about everything," Hays said 
of birding. "No day is ever the same. There's always a surprise. It's the 
thrill of seeing something new or rare, the number of species or the numbers in 
a particular species." 
</P>
<P>
Other birds spotted Sunday included some song sparrows, a black-billed plover, 
a Belding's Savannah sparrow, a great blue heron, ruddy ducks and a brown 
pelican. 
</P>
<P>
Also spotted waddling along the water was one large, white, domestic goose. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the goose, which looked out of place surrounded by the smaller wild 
birds, Hays noted that people who abandon domestic birds in wildlife reserves 
can be arrested by a game warden.

EUROPEAN STARLING 
</P>
<P>
(Sturnus vulgaris) 
</P>
<P>
Description: Adult in breeding plumage is iridescent black with a yellow bill. 
In fresh fall plumage, feathers are tipped with white and buff, giving an 
overall speckled appearance; bill becomes brownish. Short, square tail, stocky 
body, and short, broad-based pointed wings that appear pale gray from below. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Mostly open fields, woodland, suburbia and cities. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Other inverts and berries. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Courting male 
</P>
<P>
adopts variety of postures while vocalizing; highest intensity includes 
flailing wings in hunched stance. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: In any handy cavity; slovenly cup of grass, twigs, forbs, rootlets and 
straw. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Pale bluish or greenish white, marked with browns. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Starlings were introduced in New York City's Central 
Park one hundred years ago and quickly spread across the continent. Bold and 
aggressive, it often competes successfully with native species for nest holes. 
Varied call notes include squeaks, warbles, chirps and twittering; also 
imitates the songs of other species. Outside of nesting season, starlings are 
usually seen in large flocks, sometimes in company with grackles and 
blackbirds. Within one century, the 60 starlings introduced to North America 
have increased to over 200 million. 
</P>
<P>

LONG-EARED OWL (Asio otus) 
</P>
<P>
Description: Slender with long, close-set ear tufts. Boldly streaked and barred 
on breast and belly; facial disk is rusty. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Conifer and mixed conifer- deciduous forest, especially near water, 
parks, orchards and farm woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Mostly rodents; rarely amphibians, reptiles, fish and insects. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: The courting male flies erratic and zigzags with deep, slow 
wingbeats, occasionally gliding and clapping wings together beneath his body. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Usually in abandoned nests (especially those of crow, also squirrel, 
hawk, magpie, heron, raven). Built of small sticks, inner bark strips and pine 
needles. Female selects the site. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: White, 1.6 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: This owl is a night hunter and is able to locate even 
faint sounds with remarkable accuracy. At night it flies over open fields and 
marshes, during the day it roosts in trees, close to the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
Familiarity with the environment, especially such things as the heights of 
favorite perches above the ground, seems to be essential to the owl's ability 
to pounce on prey. Hearing helps replace the absence of sight, but intimate 
knowledge of the habitat completes the job. 
</P>
<P>
Is more gregarious in winter; flocks may roost together. Generally a silent 
bird, except during breeding season. His common call is one or more long 
hooo's. 
</P>
<P>

Peter Bloom used to watch the great blue herons on Irvine Lake when he played 
there as a child. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bloom is vice president of the Sea and Sage chapter of the Audubon 
Society and he is working with the Irvine Co. on a plan to build new homes in 
his childhood playground without disturbing the county's largest colony of the 
giant, graceful birds. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom and Ginny Chester, also of the Audubon Society, helped negotiate the East 
Orange General Plan, which was approved by the Orange City Council in December, 
so that the Irvine Co.'s development plans would not endanger the heron. 
</P>
<P>
At Bloom's suggestion, the company agreed to relocate two housing tracts and 
preserve 200 acres of wild oak groves near the proposed Limestone Canyon 
Regional Park. It also agreed to a five-year study and relocation plan for a 
colony of great blue herons that nest on the north shore of the lake where the 
company wants to build a road. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 pairs of herons nest in sycamore and oak trees along the shore of the 
Irvine Lake, also known as Santiago Reservoir. The Irvine Co. has agreed to 
either get the birds to move to new nests or abandon its plans to build a road 
there, said Lee Jones, resource specialist for Michael Brandman Associates, 
which prepared the environmental impact report for the development. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, biologists will determine where the herons eat, how many are 
breeding successfully and where they go in the winter. They will also 
coordinate the study with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and the state 
Department of Fish and Game, Jones said. Leg bands will be placed on the young 
birds to keep track of them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After studying the birds, the biologists hope to encourage the herons to nest 
somewhere else, either along the southwest edge of the lake, on an island in 
the lake or elsewhere in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, herons are found along the Santa Ana River, Bolsa Chica 
Reserve, Upper Newport Bay, San Joaquin Marsh, Anaheim Lake and Dana Point 
Harbor. Bloom said the Irvine Lake rookery is the largest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the relocation program might include the planting of vegetation at 
other sites and the use of nesting platforms or heron decoys to encourage the 
birds to breed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
After monitoring the new nesting site for three years and conducting annual 
counts of the breeding colonies, biologists will decide whether they can 
develop in the area without damaging the heron colony. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the Audubon Society and the Irvine Co., the road 
could be built if at least 50% of the birds from the Irvine Lake rookery are 
nesting elsewhere. If not, the company could continue the relocation program or 
abandon its plans to build the road. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Irvine Co. does this right, meaning funding the study properly, this 
could be a one-of-a-kind study," Bloom said. Not much is known about the habits 
of great blue herons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Adult great blue herons stand three to four feet high, with a wing span of 
about six feet. Sometimes mistaken for cranes, herons can be distinguished from 
other birds by the U-shape of their neck in flight. 
</P>
<P>
Although they were hunted for their colorful blue-gray plumage earlier in the 
century, great blue herons are not now listed as endangered or threatened. But 
biologists say that development has reduced the habitat of herons, putting them 
at risk. SHANNON SANDS

   Flying Rat Trap Finds Home in Central Park
   ----
   By Marie Winn

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12
</SO>
<LP>
   New York -- It was around 7 a.m. on Sept. 24, that Dorothy
Poole, a Manhattan market researcher and a passionate bird
watcher, first saw the Central Park barn owl. A bird class
under the aegis of the American Museum of Natural History had
made its way to the Ramble, a little wilderness in the heart
of Central Park, when a sudden commotion arose. "Those
bluejays are mobbing something," said Steve Quinn, the
group's leader. "It might be a hawk or an owl." A moment
later Ms. Poole saw the barn owl sitting in plain sight on a
horizontal branch of a sweetgum tree. It was asleep.
   Accompanying Ms. Poole's group that morning was police
Officer Daniel Delia of the Central Park precinct. Though he
was there in the line of duty (the Ramble is not always a
safe place), he, too, was excited about the owl. Indeed,
Officer Delia was the first to find an owl pellet at the base
of the sweetgum tree. An owl pellet is not an appetizing
concept. Owls eat their prey whole. Then they regurgitate the
stuff they cannot digest -- fur, bones, claws, teeth and the
like -- in the form of a cylindrical mass called a pellet.
Officer Delia's find contained a recognizable rat skull and
some bones.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A few days later the owl moved to a nearby paulownia tree.
There it sat day after day for almost two months, always on
the same branch some 30 feet off the ground. "Roost
fidelity," the bird books call such behavior. It means that
the bird has found a favorable hunting spot.
   The barn owl, Tyto alba, is easily distinguished from all
other owls by its long, heart-shaped white or golden facial
mask, which gives it a rather simian aspect. This has led to
one of its vernacular names, the monkey-faced owl. It has "a
slightly creepy expression," according to the Birdwatcher's
Companion, an encyclopedic handbook. Nevertheless it is
considered a beautiful bird. It is also an exceptionally
useful bird: In a life span of about 10 years, a single barn
owl can consume something like 11,000 rodents, according to
Paul Johnsgard, the author of "North American Owls."
   Indeed, the barn owl's entire evolutionary history has
designed it for catching rodents -- a flying rat-trap,
someone once called it. Its eyesight and hearing are
particularly adapted for hunting small prey in the dark. Its
wing design enables it to hover for over a minute without
stalling, as it homes in on its prey. And thanks to a special
layer of soft velvety feathers, the barn owl's flight, like
that of most other owls, is completely silent. This is bad
news for the hapless rodent in its path.
   The word "owl," by the way, is onomatopoeic in origin, and
descends from the same root as the word "ululate" which means
to howl. Most owls do howl, in some form or another. Some
give off the traditional "whoo, whoo" that owls are known
for. The barn owl's howl, however, is closer to a
bone-chilling shriek, according to Julio de la Torre, author
of "Owls: Their Life and Behavior."
   By now, the Central Park barn owl has become something of
a celebrity. Barn owls, after all, are rare visitors to the
park. Little crowds congregate in the clearing where the owl
is roosting. Passers-by observe people looking up into a
tree. They inquire, look up in turn, and suddenly exclaim "I
see it] My God] It's really an owl]" Joseph DiConstanza, a
research and field biologist at the natural history museum,
often "nips over" during his lunch break. His friend Sandy
Faison, a vice president at J.P. Morgan Securities, followed
his directions to the owl on Nov. 3. "I've been looking for a
barn owl for 14 years," he said with considerable feeling, as
he stood before the paulownia tree and gazed at the sleeping
raptor.
   Because the owl sits and sleeps quietly on its preferred
roost for most of the day, some people contend that it is a
fake, a cardboard decoy. But on one occasion a bird watcher
made mouse-like squeaking noises and suddenly the owl opened
its dark eyes. It looked from side to side several times,
swaying weirdly. Then it went back to sleep. So far, no one
has heard it utter a sound. Not a long-drawn scream, nor a
loud raspy hiss, sss-ksch, nor even the chuckling note which
is like a snore -- as its various utterances are described in
the Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds.
   No one has seen it glide silently from its perch after
dark to go a-hunting. No one has seen it raise its wings
suddenly, then plummet down to grasp a doomed rat in its
cruel talons. No one has seen it return triumphantly to its
branch and swallow its prey whole, head first, tail
disappearing last. But serious victims of owl fever find
themselves imagining such events at odd moments, especially
after nightfall. That's the best they can do, for certainly
no one with any sense would enter the lawless Ramble at
night, not even the growing coterie of visitors captivated by
the owl's beauty and mystery.
   But love is inevitably accompanied by anxiety. Nearby
signs proclaiming "Caution: Rat Poison," cause many an owl
idolater to fear that the great winged ratter might eat a
tainted rodent and die. Not to worry, says Marc Matsil of the
Parks Department. Precisely to protect owl and hawk visitors
to the park, the department recently switched from a
decoagulant type of poison to a substance called Quintox that
is not toxic to birds. Yet all is not well for the barn owl,
according to Todd Culver of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.
The species is declining across its entire range, due to
habitat loss and to farmers' increasing use of rodenticides
(rather than barn owls).
   By the second week of November the paulownia tree was
almost bare. Most of its large heart-shaped leaves lay on the
ground and only scattered clusters of its pecan-shaped fruit
remained. I knew perfectly well that the owl could not stay
there much longer -- it had lost its cover. Yet when I
arrived one day for my daily visit and found the owl missing
I couldn't accept the idea that it had gone for good. I
continued to check the clearing day after day, hoping against
hope that the bird would return.
   On Nov. 16, a Saturday, I had gone to look for the owl one
last time. As I was leaving, I ran into a man with
binoculars, the badge of the bird fraternity. "You haven't
seen the owl?" I asked without much hope. "Oh, yes, I just
found its new tree," he answered, explaining his success in
this way: "I asked myself: `If I were an owl, where would I
go?' Then I looked for the most foliated tree near its old
roost."
   The man turned out to be Curtis Berger, a law professor at
the Columbia Law School and a bird watcher with more than 600
birds on his life list. This, however, was his first barn
owl. He led me to a large Norway maple not far from the owl's
original roost. And there was my barn owl, sitting on a high
branch. Framed with dark green foliage, it was beautifully
visible. The sun glistened on its spotted golden breast and I
must admit that my heart actually jumped for joy at the
sight.

<LEADPARA>  IF YOU hear the words "National Audubon Society," birds and bird-watchers
probably come to mind. It's an identity any environmental group would covet.
But to Peter A.A. Berle, the lawyer who took over the venerable conservation
organization in the mid-1980s, it's all wrong.;   "The bird image hurts us,"
declares one Berle associate. "The old school of conservationists, who were
interested in wildlife for wildlife's sake, are dying out. We're left with a
populace that is interested in the environment to the degree that it touches
their private lives, i.e., waste disposal."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A HARD LOOK AT AUDUBON SOCIETY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Magazines  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     However that may be, reporter Dyan Zaslowsky makes a persuasive case in the
September-October Harrowsmith Country Life that the changes Berle is carrying
out at the National Audubon Society court its self-destruction. As prominent
an old friend of the society as Roger Tory Peterson told Zaslowsky that John
James Audubon would be "absolutely bewildered" by the changes.;   Zaslowsky
acknowledges that Berle put a financially messy house in order. But she
wonders openly about his wisdom in spending members' contributions on a brand
new headquarters building, expensive image consultants and protracted legal
wrangling with the New York State Audubon Society. Critics charge Berle with
empire building and Greenpeace envy (Audubon claims 600,000 members to
Greenpeace's 2 million).;   "We like birds," says Berle. "We just don't think
birds are the end of it." As part of his effort to broaden the appeal and
build the society membership, Berle recently abandoned its emblem. The
graceful egret in flight gave way to a corporate-style logo with a flag motif
that puts Les Line, whom Berle removed last spring after 25 years of editing
Audubon magazine, in mind of "a certain brand of roach killer.";   As a
casualty in Berle's drive to remake the society's image through its most
visible platform, Line is not impartial. But his analysis of larger forces at
work in the environmental movement has a compelling ring: "The naturalists
have been replaced by ecocrats who are more comfortable on Capitol Hill than
in the woods, fields, meadows, mountains and swamps. You can certainly argue
that garbage and other issues are related, but there are organizations already
addressing those things. . . . Environmentalists have grown so homogenized
that there are fewer and fewer of them who want to place birds and wildlife
first.";   Souls for sale in Hollywood; An award-winning short story writer,
who also chooses to remain anonymous, sold her soul -- admittedly for lots of
money -- to create scripts for a TV sitcom with her friend Maxine. Her diary
of a descent into inanity is in the September-October Buzz: "I'm numb. I can't
tell any more if this script is any good; I can't even tell if it makes sense.
Why are we doing this? I think of a story Maxine told me about how her husband
spent hours pitching jokes to an impatient producer. " 'Yeah, yeah,' the
producer kept saying. "Like that. But funny.' Who knows what's funny any more?
In a world where everything's supposed to be ridiculous, can anything really
seem ridiculous?";   Compelling story of abuse; Yet another writer has reason
to remain anonymous. He's telling the painful story of his 7-year-old son's
sexual abuse by a trusted teacher's aide. Such stories are becoming
commonplace, regrettably. This one, in the September-October Mother Jones, is
different, and compelling, in at least two respects: The little boy's
agonizing experience of abuse triggers the father's memory of his own abuse as
a child -- by an older friend he still knows and sees regularly. And the
experience of bringing the boy's abuser to justice proves nearly as
destructive, in the hands of insensitive prosecutors and counselors, as the
abuse itself.;   The laws of reality; Now that computers have been able to
give us a plausibly pregnant Bruce Willis, and a good laugh, it's worth
wondering again -- as Marshall Blonsky does in the September Allure -- about
the implications of manipulating images of presumed reality. One professional
photographer quoted here, Barry Blackman, feels liberated by the technology:
"I am no longer hindered by the laws of physics and the laws of reality." Fred
Ritchin, a critic, worries: "If the photograph is thought of as a plaything to
be retouched, then when real photographs tell us something serious in the
future, who's going to believe them?" (box)  </TEXT>

BREEDING BIRD: GREEN-BACKED HERON (BUTORIDES STRIATUS) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Description: Small, stocky heron with short yellow legs (males' legs are bright 
orange during high mating plumage); glossy blue-green back; neck is deep 
chestnut. The immature heron is browner above, white chest and neck streaked 
with brown. 
</P>
<P>
Average length is 18 inches, wing span is 26 inches. Formerly called the Little 
Green Heron. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Marshes, ponds, wetlands; often perch in tops of eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Fish, insects, snails, crayfish, shrimp and small amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Male raises crest and neck plumes, swells throat and calls while 
hopping from foot to foot in front of female. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Woven twigs and branches near or over water. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Light green with bluish hue. Length is 1 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Notes: Green-backed herons have been observed using insects, berries or twigs 
(which are often trimmed to size) for bait. After casting the lures onto the 
water, the herons crouch and wait for curious or hungry fish to inspect the 
bait. This is a rare case of tool use and, especially, tool manufacturing in 
ornithology. 
</P>
<P>
Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding bird atlas, call Sea and Sage Audubon 
Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 
786-3160.

TRAIL RUNS DOWNHILL FROM MOUNTAINS TO BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skyline to the Sea Trail, as its name suggests, drops from the crest of the 
Santa Cruz Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, it runs downhill on its scenic 35-mile journey from Castle 
Rock State Park to Big Basin Redwoods State Park to Waddell Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Views from the Skyline -- redwood-forested slopes, fern-smothered canyons and 
the great blue Pacific -- are superb. 
</P>
<P>
This gem of a trail has many friends. During one weekend in 1969, dedicated 
members of the Sempervirens Fund and the Santa Cruz Trails Assn. turned out 
more than 2,000 volunteers to dig, clear, prune and otherwise improve the 
trail. Area volunteers put together an annual Trails Day that is now a model 
for trails organizations throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
A fine backpack for a three-day weekend would be to trek the 35 miles of 
Skyline from Castle Rock State Park to Big Basin, then onward to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Rock, perched on the western ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains, is in 
turn connected by trails to parks and open-space preserves in the Santa Clara 
Valley. With judicious use of a map, a longer backpacking trip could be 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
The wildest and most beautiful part of the Skyline stretches from park 
headquarters at Big Basin to Waddell Creek Beach and Marsh. It winds through 
deep woods and explores the moist environments of Waddell and Berry creeks. 
</P>
<P>
Springtime, when the creeks are frothy torrents and Berry Creek Falls cascades 
at full vigor, is a particularly dramatic time to walk the Skyline to the Sea 
Trail; during summer, the cool world of the redwood canyons is a great place to 
escape the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Big Basin -- California's first state park, set aside in 1902 -- survived last 
October's Santa Cruz earthquake in pretty good shape. Park roads were cracked, 
electric lines went down and pipes ruptured. The park was closed immediately 
after the quake, but was soon reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers believe that few, if any, of the tall redwoods toppled because of the 
quake, though many trees lost heavy branches. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From Santa Cruz, drive 12 miles north on Highway 9. 
Turn west on Highway 236 and proceed nine miles to Big Basin Redwoods State 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
If you're hiking from Big Basin to the sea, you'll need to arrange a car 
shuttle. Waddell Beach, at trail's end, is 18 miles upcoast from Santa Cruz on 
Highway 1. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, take the bus, which stops at both the state park and Waddell Beach. 
One suggestion: Leave your car at the Santa Cruz bus station (920 Pacific Ave.) 
and take the 7:45 a.m. (weekends) bus bound for the state park. You'll arrive 
about 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Hit the trail and take the 5:15 p.m. bus from Waddell Beach back to Santa Cruz. 
Schedules are different on weekends and weekdays and change frequently. Call 
the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District at (408) 425-8600 for the latest 
bus schedule. The $2 daily ride pass is a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: The trail begins in the nucleus of the park on Opal Creek flatlands 
at the bottom of the basin. From park headquarters, join Redwood Trail, which 
crosses a bridge and travels a few hundred yards to a signed junction with 
Skyline to the Sea Trail. You'll turn toward the sea and begin a stiff climb 
out of the basin, passing junctions with other park trails. 
</P>
<P>
After climbing, the trail descends through deep and dark woods, first with 
Kelly Creek, then along the west fork of Waddell Creek. Ferns and mushrooms, 
salamanders and banana slugs occupy the wet world of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
Some four miles from the trailhead, just short of the confluence of Waddell 
Creek and Berry Creek, you'll intersect Berry Creek Falls Trail. The falls 
cascade over fern-covered cliffs into a frothy pool. 
</P>
<P>
An ideal lunch stop, or turnaround spot, is Sunset Trail Camp, located a mile 
up Berry Creek Falls Trail and near another falls -- Golden Falls. 
</P>
<P>
Skyline to the Sea Trail descends with Waddell Creek and passes through the 
heart of the beautiful Waddell Valley. Rancho del Oso, "Ranch of the Bears," as 
this region is known, has second-generation redwoods, Douglas fir and Monterey 
pine, as well as lush meadows. 
</P>
<P>
A mile and a half from the ocean, you'll reach Twin Redwoods Camp. As you near 
the sea, the redwoods give way to laurel groves and meadow land. Near trail's 
end is a freshwater marsh, a favorite stopping place for migratory birds on the 
Pacific flyway. 
</P>
<P>
A wildlife sanctuary, Theodore J. Hoover Natural Preserve, has been established 
in the heart of the marsh area for more than 200 kinds of native and migratory 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
The trail ends at Highway 1. West of the highway is a bus stop and wind-swept 
Waddell Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Maps detailing the Skyline to the Sea Trail are available at park headquarters 
or by mail. 
</P>

<TEXT>     Wyatt, meanwhile, has trained her high-powered telescope, called simply a
"scope" by birders, on a hummingbird singing loudly at Charleston Slough on
the Palo Alto/Mountain View border.;    "He's the only North American
hummingbird that sings," Wyatt remarks. "Oh, you are pretty," she tells the
bird.;    Stoye immediately drops the story of what happened 12 years ago in
Fremont.;    "Isn't he pretty?" she says, training her binoculars on the tiny
bird.;    Wyatt takes her eye from the scope, leans toward her listener and
lowers her voice. "They're very, you'll pardon the expression, randy," she
says.;    It's just another day in the marsh for Stoye and Wyatt, co-editors
of a guide to bird-watching hot spots in the Silicon Valley and two of an
estimated 61 million Americans who spend their leisure time sloshing through
marshes and beating up and down trails to catch a glimpse of an animal that
flies away when it notices them.;    "I'd say there are two birders now for
every bird," Wyatt says dryly, commenting on how fashionable bird watching has
become since she first got interested some 40 years ago. At that time, she
told everyone that her binoculars were for use in the cheap seats at sporting
events. In reality, she was a "closet birder.";    That has all changed. "It's
an acceptable thing to do now," Wyatt insists, adjusting the cap covered with
bird pins she wears in the field. Later, though, she admits that birders are
"a shade eccentric," especially when a rare bird is spotted.;    Then, she
says, the sighting will be announced on a recorded rare bird hot line
(415-524-5592) and the chase is on. When a wood stork was spotted in the delta
last year, for example, hundreds of birders ran for the levees until one
overzealous observer got too close and scared the bird away. He was very
unpopular in birding circles for a time.;    Eccentric behavior aside, looking
at birds is now so acceptable that the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society
(which has 5,000 paying members) usually schedules two birding field trips
each weekend, along with a Wednesday morning trip twice a month and a bird
discussion group that meets monthly. The field trips lately have been
attracting as many as 40 birders.;    "I don't know if it's from Earth Day or
what," says Cecily Harris, director of the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society
and the third co-editor of "Birding at the Bottom of the Bay." "But it keeps
getting more and more popular.";    "People are more in tune with the
environment," says Jean Dobbins, a staff member in the American Birds
Department of the National Audubon Society. "They're more interested in
activities that go along with conservation.";    Wyatt and Stoye have other
ideas.;    "You think there's a lot wrong with the world, but there must be
something right if these birds keep coming back," says Stoye as she tries to
coax a sora rail out of some cattails. "Pssh, pssh, pssh," she hisses at the
elusive bird.;    "I think it's partly to do with TV," adds Wyatt. "People see
these nature specials and they think, 'I'll go out for a bird walk.' ";    "It
has great appeal," Stoye says, unable to get the rail to show itself. "So many
things in life are predictable. This is unpredictable.";    "It's part of the
Protestant work ethic," Wyatt continues. "You can't just go and do something
because it's fun. You have to have an excuse.";    Which is why birders keep
lists, lots and lots of lists of the types of birds they've seen, where
they've seen them and when the bird appeared.;    "Usually you have a day list
and a year list," says Stoye. "Lots of people have a county list and a state
list.";    Almost everybody has a life list, a roster of all the species
they've seen since they started birding seriously. Wyatt's has about 695
species of birds on it. She's shooting for 700, which she calls "a
respectable" number.;    "It's just a form of discipline," Stoye says of the
lists. "It makes you really look at the bird and identify it." At the moment,
Stoye is identifying an Audubon's warbler.;    "Actually, they're really
called yellow-rumped warblers," says Stoye, explaining that the name was
changed recently in the United States to conform with the bird's name in other
countries.;    "But we just call them butter butts," Wyatt adds.;    Both
Stoye and Wyatt are at the point in their birding careers at which they are
searching for "life birds" -- the few they've chosen that will make their life
lists complete, or as complete as these things get.;    Luckily, they live in
an area that just might make the sightings possible. Although the drought in
California and in bird breeding areas in Canada and the United States has had
an effect on bird populations, the San Francisco Bay Area is still known
internationally as a birding hot spot. The varied habitats of the bay and the
hills support more than 300 avian species. That's more than some entire
regions of the country, says Wyatt.;    "I just don't know what I'd do if I
lived somewhere like Iowa," she says.;    Wyatt and Stoye's "Birding at the
Bottom of the Bay" was written, in part, for frustrated birders from out of
state who find themselves in the promised land of the Silicon Valley and don't
know where to find a Eurasian widgeon or ferruginous hawk. It's also good for
birding beginners, who may have lived in bird heaven all their lives and never
realized it.;    The book is divided into five sections corresponding to five
different habitats in the Silicon Valley. About 50 members of the Santa Clara
Valley Audubon Society helped write the guide, which lists 40 different spots
for birding within the county and gives lots of advice on day trips outside
Santa Clara County.  </TEXT>

   Preservation of Matagorda Island, habitat for
wintering whooping cranes and other endangered species of birds,
entered the home stretch when a Senate committee approved
legislation to buy the last bit of privately held land on the
barrier island, officials said Tuesday.
   ``This is important not only for whooping cranes, but for water
fowl, shore birds, and herons, egrets and song birds,'' said Brent
Giezentanner, manager of the nearby Aransas Pass National Wildlife
Refuge.
   A Senate appropriations subcommittee late Monday approved
spending $5.5 million to purchase 5,017 acres at the southern tip
of the Texas Gulf Coast island.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will buy the land at cost
from the Texas Nature Conservancy, and when the deal goes through
all the land on the island will be in either federal or state
ownership, according to the office of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   But a Gramm staffer said it still is unclear how the land will
be managed, with debate centering on whether it should be the state
or federal government or both. The state controls 24,893 acres, and
when the final purchase goes through, the federal government will
control 30,502 acres.
   As the whooping crane flock grows, some of the endangered birds
have wintered on Matagorda Island rather than at the Aransas refuge.
   ``This is going to preserve and protect their habitat from
development,'' said Giezentanner. ``There are only two barrier
islands in Texas that are not developed to some degree _ Matagorda
and (adjacent) San Jose.''
   More than 230 species of birds can be found on Matagorda Island,
including endangered song birds who make the island their first
landfall upon their northern spring migration from South America,
Giezentanner said. A total of 20 endangered species of birds use
the island.
   He said 132 whooping cranes wintered last year at the Aransas
refuge or nearby, including Matagorda Island. Two other members of
the flock also spent the winter in Texas _ a record high since the
early 1930s.
   The record low was in 1941, when 15 of the birds spent the
winter in Texas and six others in Louisiana, he said.
   Of the 134 whooping cranes that left Wood Buffalo National Park
in the Northwest Terrorities, Canada, for Texas last fall, 25 were
fledged birds _ those just able to fly _ and all made the 2,500 to
2,800-mile journey.

<DATELINE> Snake River Canyon, Idaho  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is as close to paradise as a bird of prey can get. 
Five-hundred-foot-high canyon walls are honeycombed with niches, cavities, ledges and crevices that make perfect aeries. 
Canyon winds create drafts the birds ride up to their hunting grounds. 
They descend easily to their nests with their prey. (Most cliff dwellers have to carry their prey up 200 feet or more to their nests.) The sagebrush and winterfat growing on the sandy plateau soil provide food and cover for Townsend ground squirrels and jackrabbits, among the most important prey in this prey-rich landscape. 
Nesting prairie falcons alone consume 60,000 ground squirrels in six or seven weeks. 
The world's greatest concentration of nesting prairie falcons lives here, part of the densest nesting population of raptors in North America, and one of the densest in the world. 

   Each spring between 600 and 800 pairs of raptors nest here. 
They always have. 
For most of history nobody paid them much attention until a young soil scientist named Morley Nelson noticed their extraordinary numbers in the late '30s. 
Aware of how easily wildlife habitat disappears, he began lobbying for some kind of protection for the region. 

   In 1971, the cliff nesting areas received protected status. 
In 1980 The Snake River Birds of Prey Area was established under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) -- 482,640 acres along an approximately 80-mile stretch of the Snake River. 
At last, hunting grounds on the plateaus above the canyon, vital to the survival of 15 species of falcons, eagles, hawks, owls and vultures, would be preserved. 

   I spent a few days in the Birds of Prey Area in late May. 
Arriving one hot afternoon, I drove the long, dusty road that crosses the plateau and twists steeply down to the canyon floor. 
The road ends at the Swan Falls Dam, erected by Idaho Power in 1901. 
From the dam I followed a primitive sandy road a short way along the Snake River. 
Shimmering sun on the calm, green water echoed the flittering movement of swifts and swallows above it. 
Two marmots scurried across the road. 
A prairie falcon screamed, but I could not locate it, although, in the hot silence, the cry seemed as visible as movement. 
A redtailed hawk circled above the plateau, then back, out of view. 
Most birds roosted unseen in the coolness of shadows, their presence announced only by splashes of whitewash on the walls, but a couple of pigeons strutted around a little cavelike niche. 

   The best way to see birds here is from the river. 
This strip of the Snake is easy, the kind of river you can drift lazily down, taking your time to scan the cliffs for birds. 
Usually. 

   The day I had arranged to meet BLM biologist Randy Trujillo and BLM Public Affairs Officer Barry Rose for a ride upriver in the BLM jet boat was gray from the start. (The jet boat seemed less ideal than the two-day canoe trip required to cover the distance, but spending time with a biologist whose territory this was was too good a chance to pass up.) A cold, damp wind swept across the plateau and funneled through the canyon. 
On the choppy, white-capped river, the boat fairly leapt from wave crest to wave crest, or landed hard in the trough between. 
We sat huddled in all the clothes we had brought. 
Where the canyon opened into riparian areas, high grasses bowed in the wind. 
A great blue heron, flying along the water's edge, seemed, in this forbidding light, an ominous bird. 
When you put binoculars to your eyes, you risked knocking yourself out as the boat's movement jolted them into your forehead. 

   Planning to drift downriver to the dam, Randy cut the motor at our turning point. 
Carried to shallow water by wind and waves, the boat hit bottom. 
The motor, having ingested pebbles, became useless as an aid in getting out. 
We pushed with oars but the boat would not budge. 
Randy jumped into the river to push, while we continued from the boat. 
Nothing happened. 
Barry jumped in as well. 
The boat moved. 
A smaller, auxiliary motor was attached and used for the trip back. 
The sky threatened with darker clouds. 
Two prairie falcons flew over, and afterward, two vultures. 
The men, wet to their waists, must have been freezing. 

   In a moment of relative calm, we found a golden eagle's nest in a niche on a south cliff, the eagle's head visible above the nest sticks. 
The eagle did not move. 

   I find it hard to call a place with eagles in it desolate, but because this area looked desolate to many people for so long, it seemed a good place to practice war. 
The army used it as a bombing range during World War II. 
Since 1953, the Idaho National Guard has used it as a tank-training ground. 
In 1986, the Guard proposed expanding and upgrading facilities on its Orchard Training Ground, 138,000 acres more or less in the middle of the BOPA. When the National Wildlife Federation responded in 1988 with a release about the potential danger to the birds through a loss of prey because of lost habitat, the national outcry was greater than anyone expected. 
The BLM and the National Guard had some serious, and fast, moving to do. 

   The two agencies framed a policy to develop a joint research project. 
To be funded by the Departments of Interior and Defense, it will focus on past and present impacts of military training in the BOPA. 
In other words, can eagles and tanks use the same desert? 
For the duration of the study, current environmental-awareness briefing of troops, revegetation programs and firefighting efforts will continue and/or be expanded. 
Firefighting is everybody's top priority. 
Maj. Richard Sheehan, the Guard's environmental engineer; Mike Kokert, BLM research leader in the BOPA; and Bill Burnham, director of the World Center for Birds of Prey, all told me fire is the gravest danger here. 
This land burns fast in the dry summer, partly because cheatgrass, an exotic introduced to improve grazing (although the cattle would rather eat something else) burns fast. 
Thriving on fire, it usurps the place of sagebrush and winterfat, destroying habitat that the raptor's prey requires. 
Most fires are started by lightning. 
Some are sparked by ammunition. 
The Guard has firefighters on the spot the minute a fire is sighted. 

   When the study is finished in 1992, a National Environmental Policy Act review will be conducted to consider mitigation, and possible modification of future military training in the Orchard Training Area, as well as the impacts of recreational, commercial, grazing and other activities in this multiple-use area. 

   Morley Nelson (who has meanwhile become one of the world's foremost raptor authorities, and a cinematographer responsible for bringing astonishing views of raptors to millions of people) is willing to trust this process. 
"I believe that the Guard intends to do it right, technically," he says, adding, "If they don't, I'll be right back there fussing with them. 
The next time I fuss with them, I'm going all the way to the nation. 
It was the nation that set the Snake River Birds of Prey Area, and it should be the nation that decides what happens in the end. 
It's a national treasure, an international treasure, not a state treasure." 

   Behind Mr. Nelson's house is an array of cages and enclosures for a variety of raptors. 
An eagle sits on a high roost. 
A hawk flaps its wings as one of the raptor biology students comes by with food. 
A sick baby owl, found the previous day by a neighbor boy, sits bewildered but calm, as Mr. Nelson examines it. 
A gyrfalcon who believes Mr. Nelson is his mate screams at him to come sit on an egg that has been placed in his cage. 
The bird calms down as soon as Mr. Nelson enters the cage. 

   At the World Center for Birds of Prey, I saw newly hatched peregrines, peregrine eggs about to hatch, and rare tropical raptors housed in a state-of-the art climate-controlled building. 
One-way windows allowed me a closeup view of some of the most endangered birds on Earth, caged so that future generations might fly free. 

   I left the World Center and drove back to the Birds of Prey Area to watch birds that have always been free. 
Hunting the plateau, they circled over the brush, searching, diving, soaring, floating on the air above this dry land that seems to stretch forever. 
Wild things, they live as they have for thousands of years. 
There is a reasonable chance they'll go on for thousands more.

<LEADPARA>  If Fremont's picturesque Lake Elizabeth looks at times like a scene out of an
Alfred Hitchcock movie, with birds and waterfowl covering lawns and walkways,
it may be in part the doing of people who visit the park.;    Ducks, geese and
other birds are hatching their babies right now at Lake Elizabeth, a place
they call home because it's got what they need: a big body of water in an era
of dwindling wetlands, grass, shade, nesting spots -- and lots of Fremont
residents who bring leftover bread and crackers to feed the web-footed
critters.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GEESE SETTLE IN AT LAKE ELIZABETH
TAKE A GANDER AT THIS CROWD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Those benefiting most from the benign setting appear to be the Canada
geese. The population of the big brown geese with the sleek black necks has
soared in the past several years, ranger supervisor Judy Felber said.;   
Canada geese usually migrate, but have made Lake Elizabeth their home because
of the ideal conditions. Now they are considered true residents, just like
taxpayers.;    But there is trouble at the lake.;    About 50 of the 90
domestic geese at the park have been found dead over the past two months. A
few of the Canada geese have also died. U.C. Davis veterinarians said two
Central Park geese died from an infection called Fowl Cholera, a bacteria
common in the wild. Public health officials at U.C. Davis said the bacteria is
not a public health threat. It does not appear to extend to wild and domestic
ducks at Lake Elizabeth.;    The goose culture started about 15 years ago when
four of the migratory fowl settled in Fremont, Felber said. A fifth goose
joined them about a year later. They liked what they saw. They multiplied --
exponentially. Today, Felber estimates, there are about 400 descendents of the
original five, though only about 200 to 300 remain at the lake.;    This year,
they hatched 92 goslings who have thrilled young and old alike as the chicks
grow up before their eyes. The mom-and-pop geese teach the young'uns to swim,
walk and forage for food in the hedges and brush beside the lake.;    Joshua
Reese, a 7-year-old Fremont resident, likes to chase the goslings across the
lawn. "Excuse me! Excuse me!" he shouts to them. "Look at all the gooses.";   
Why are their numbers so high? Felber says the geese are more aggressive than
ducks, so they hog many good nesting spots on "Bird Island," the patch of land
in the middle of the lake. But even more important, Canada geese are a
"protected" species under the United States' Migratory Bird Treaty Act with
Mexico, Canada and other nations. That means that it's illegal for the rangers
to try to reduce or control their population.;    The rangers at Lake
Elizabeth do "control" the domestic bird population -- that is, of mallards
and snow geese and other fowl, by taking eggs out of some nests on Bird Island
while the mother is off doing something else.;    "The mother will come back
and look like (she's saying) 'gee where did they go?' " said Judy Morris,
another park ranger.;    The officials also have reduced the amount of bird
food they sell to the public at the ranger station, hoping birds will find the
place less appealing if they get less to eat.;    This may seem unkind, but
Morris says without population controls, the 80-acre lake would be overrun
with feathered creatures. Not only would it be impossible to traverse the
pathways, it would mean the end of windsurfing at Lake Elizabeth: the
waterfowl feces can build up harmful bacteria, and too much makes lake water
unsafe for human contact.;    In 1987, the city closed Lake Elizabeth to water
sports for eight months because of a hazardous buildup of the bacteria, which
can cause digestive problems.;    Right now, geese and ducks are laying and
hatching like crazy. Around the perimeter of the lake, male mallards, known
for their shiny green heads and colorful plumage, stand guard while the
duller-colored, brown females incubate their eggs in the shade by the lake
shore.;    But many of the mallard eggs, if not taken by rangers, get eaten,
and chicks often are killed by cats, dogs, foxes or other animals, Morris
says. She's seen only a few of the fuzzy chicks actually grow up this year.;  
 Somehow, perhaps because of the more aggressive and protective nature of the
geese, their babies are living longer, Morris says.;    Though the place seems
teeming now, there are far fewer birds in summer than winter. Right now,
there's about 600 of the animals at the lake, compared with about 3,000 in
winter, when birds fly down here from the north.;    "It's more fun in
springtime," said park visitor Janet Whisman as she threw bird seed to a group
of goslings. "I love seeing the little ones just out of the eggs. I'm going to
keep feeding them -- even if this place gets taken over by birds."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Scores of workers toiled Tuesday to
rescue waterfowl from a 21,000-gallon oil spill that officials say
could leave a major wildlife area damaged for years and cost at
least $1 million to clean.
   ``Now we're looking at a dead marsh,'' said Neal Welsh, an
officer of the Audubon Society. ``Don't get your hopes up for the
next few decades.''
   The oil caused the greatest damage to a marsh area in Suisun
Bay, although a lighter slick extended about 10 miles west through
the Carquinez Strait into San Pablo Bay.
   The marsh area, 35 to 40 miles northeast of San Francisco, is
the most prized wetland of Northern California and a major stopover
along the migratory bird route that extends virtually the length of
California.
   Directed by a Coast Guard helicopter, six oil skimmers were
deployed to the worst oil slicks, and vacuum pumps worked day and
night to suck oil out of the marshes.
   The unrefined crude oil leaked from a storage tank Saturday at
Shell Oil Co.'s Martinez refinery. The company has acknowledged
responsibility for the spill.
   Shell's tab for cleanup costs could exceed $1 million, said
Larry Kolb, the Water Qaulity Control Board's regional assistant
executive. In addition, the company also is likely to face
penalties and other costs, including damage to bottoms of numerous
pleasure boats, he said.
   Under state law, Shell could face $210,000 in fines _ $10 a
gallon _ and more if the state attorney general's office files a
successful lawsuit.
   ``The cleanup could continue for days to weeks,'' said Kolb.
``The damage may be there for years.''
   State Department of Fish and Game official Brian Hunter said
about 200 soiled but living birds have been collected for
treatment, and some 75 birds have been found dead. Biologists said
the spill also threatened nests.
   The marshes are home to dozens of species of birds including
egrets, avocets, grebes, sandpipers, ducks, herons, teals and the
endangered clapper rail bird, as well as salt marsh harvest mice,
tortoises, muskrats and otters.

   A posse armed with shotguns killed about
50 pigeons after changing from lighter ammunition that was ``pretty
much bouncing off'' the birds, police said.
   A one-block area was sealed off and police authorized eight
people to shoot the pigeons, which had been damaging buildings and
posing a health hazard to the community, said Police Chief Elliot
Arens.
   ``Last week we used 8-shot and it was pretty much bouncing off.
We were hitting them and the feathers would fly and they just kept
going,'' Arens said. ``This time we used 4-shot and were knocking
them out pretty good.''
   The group bagged about 50 birds Thursday night. An earlier
outing claimed only 15, Arens said.
   The City Council approved the pigeon shoot, Arens said, after
getting a letter from a doctor and the city attorney confirming the
need to eradicate the birds.
   The pigeon plague descended on this northeastern Nebraska
community after the razing of an old bank building, which they used
as a roost.

Bolsa Chica Field Trip -- The Sea and Sage Chapter of the National Audubon 
Society is sponsoring a field trip to the Bolsa Chica wetlands on Sunday, Nov. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
It is a good time for birders to visit the wetlands, according to field-trip 
chairwoman Nancy Kenyon, because "all the birds that winter here will have 
arrived." 
</P>
<P>
These birds include many shore birds and waterfowl, including ducks, gulls, 
grebes, willets, dowitchers, killdeers and black skimmers. 
</P>
<P>
"The skimmers are pretty spectacular," Kenyon said. "They are fairly large, 
black and white, with bright orange beaks, and skim for their food along the 
top of the water. Other birds, like terns, will be flying and diving." 
</P>
<P>
Those wishing to take part in the field trip should bring binoculars, any bird 
books they might have, and a jacket. Local bird expert Doug Willick will be the 
trip leader. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be about a 2-mile loop of the wetlands, all on flat ground," Kenyon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that a special session during the trip will be devoted to beginning 
birders. 
</P>
<P>
"When we do a field trip to a very popular area like Bolsa Chica, we try to 
include something for all levels," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The public is welcome. Those wanting to participate should meet at the 
ecological reserve parking lot, on the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway 
between Golden West Street and Warner Avenue, directly across from Bolsa Chica 
State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bay Bugs -- Peter Bryant will be the guest speaker at the South Coast Audubon 
Society's regular meeting on Nov. 7. Bryant will discuss the different types of 
bugs to be found in the Back Bay area of Newport Beach. Bryant is the director 
of the Developmental Biology Center at UC Irvine. The meeting will be held at 7 
p.m. at the Orange County Marine Institute, 24200 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
Mommy and Me at the Zoo -- The Santa Ana Zoo's program for parents and 
preschoolers begins on Thursday, Nov. 15. It gives children ages 3 and 4 the 
opportunity to learn more about animals through educational games, craft 
projects and touching live animals at the zoo. There will be five sessions held 
from 10 to 11 a.m. on Nov. 15 and 29 and Dec. 6, 13 and 20. Early sign-up is 
urged. Call (714) 836-4000 for more information. The zoo is at Prentice Park, 
1801 E. Chestnut Ave.

<LEADPARA>  SPEEDING along Highway 1 between Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz, it's easy to

<TEXT>     That's too bad, because just one mile inland, there is too much to pass
by:;    A farm where a family can spend hours turning fingers purple with
pick-your-own olallie berries. Antique shops and a general store for browsing.
White clapboard cottages that create a landscape more like Maine than
California. And the best artichoke soup anywhere.;    It's a simple sign off
Highway 1, about 15 miles south of Half Moon Bay, that points inland to
"Historic Pescadero." It's only a mile to the four-corner intersection that is
the heart of this town of 250. The residents are primarily fishermen and
artichoke and flower farmers, descendants of the immigrant families that
settled the area just after the turn of the century. There is a stoplight now,
but not much else has changed.;    Artichoke hearts and charm;  Begin a visit
to town with a snack of fried artichoke hearts, a large order ($4.50) from the
Greek food stand across from the lone gas station. Nibble them during a
walking tour. To the south is Pescadero Church, a white chapel built 75 years
ago. To the north is Stage Road, with shops and quaint homes with impeccable
flower beds. Up the hill to the north is the cemetery, where early settlers
now rest.;    About a half mile from the center of town, farther east along
Pescadero Road, is Tom Phipp's Ranch -- a working farm, nursery and children's
zoo all in one. Many of the nursery plants, which had included brilliant
fuchsias, died during December's freeze. But the birds in the nursery aviary
survived -- there are toucans, quail and unusual parrots. On a recent visit,
the children's zoo had goats, pigs, a donkey, rabbits, peacocks and some
exotic poultry. Raising animals is a Phipps family hobby and you're welcome to
look around free.;    Check in at the vegetable and fruit stand, and they'll
give you a coffee can and some plastic bags to take to the five-acre berry
patch out back. Olallie berries (a California hybrid of the blackberry, only
bigger) can be picked for 80 cents a pound. The vines are tall; no need to
stoop. There also are some strawberries and raspberries. The picking season is
just about to begin and will last through the end of July, depending on the
weather. Call the ranch at (415) 879-0787 to check.;    Bird-watching tours; 
Then make time to stroll through the Pescadero marsh, the entire section of
land between the town and the ocean and one of the largest undisturbed coastal
marshes on the California coast. It is home to great blue herons and snowy
egrets and is a breeding ground for migratory ducks. State park rangers
conduct occasional weekend bird-watching tours, which begin at the corner of
Highway 1 and Pescadero Road.;    End any visit to Pescadero at Duarte's
Tavern. It's still the local institution, and still in the Duarte (pronounced
Do-art) family, as it has been since the restaurant opened in 1934. This is
the humble home of a steaming bowl of cream of artichoke soup ($3.50) that
people drive 100 miles to slurp. Other specialties include olallie berry pie
and Pescadero spaghetti ($16), which is essentially a heap of fresh mussel,
clam and shrimp cioppino atop pasta.;    Duarte's home cooking has earned a
reputation that fills the polished wooden tables on weekends, so it's best to
make a reservation at (415) 879-0464. If you just happen by, stop at the bar
for a beer and they will oblige with food to go.  </TEXT>

YEARLY CHRISTMAS BIRD COUNT BREAKS RECORD AT BONELLI PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the weeks before Christmas, most people spent their early Saturday mornings 
nestled snug in their beds or roaming the shopping malls with visions of the 
perfect gifts dancing in their heads. 
</P>
<P>
But Milt Blatt and an intrepid group of San Gabriel Valley residents went 
tramping through scrub brush and dreaming of tufted ducks, loggerhead shrikes 
and red-tailed hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Armed not with shopping bags and credit cards but with birding field guides and 
binoculars, members of the Pomona Valley Audubon Society were up before dawn 
earlier this month, canvassing the waters and back roads of Frank G. Bonelli 
County Regional Park in preparation for their annual Christmas bird count. 
</P>
<P>
In a precount expedition Dec. 12, Blatt, a retired U.S. Navy civilian employee 
from West Covina, led a party of three men and two women. As Blatt strode 
through the park, he cocked his head intently, stopping at the grass near the 
edge of Puddingstone Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"Hear that chirping? That's the Say's phoebe," Blatt announced to the group of 
retirees who were hurrying to keep up with his long-legged strides. He listened 
to another faint chirp and stopped dead in his tracks. "Excuse me -- black 
phoebe! For gosh sakes, I'm getting up too early in the morning these days," he 
exclaimed with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Novice birder Beverly Pemberton of Claremont laughed back. "He could tell me it 
was anything, and I'd believe it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Blatt, who has led the Bonelli count since 1978, said last year's total of 89 
species sighted in the park was a record. This year, the birders on Dec. 15 set 
a new record, counting 93 species at Bonelli Park and 145 within a 15-mile 
radius of Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The local count is part of a much broader effort. By Jan. 3, more than 42,000 
intrepid birders will raise their binoculars from Alaska to Brazil to count the 
winged creatures migrating across the Americas. Their totals will be published 
in a special edition of the National Audubon Society's birding magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Martin met her husband, Jack, on a birding trip nine years ago. "It's 
great to see wildlife and natural things, and it's enjoyable learning to tell 
the birds apart," said Martin, of San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
Serious birders, such as Blatt, carry powerful spotting scopes and tripods that 
bring small birds hundreds of yards away into close, sharp focus. That kind of 
close-up view is necessary because minuscule details, such as whether a beak is 
yellow-orange or yellow-green, can separate one species from another. Blatt 
records the birds he has seen in a tiny notebook bound with a rubber band and 
filled with black script. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a California towhee," Blatt said, pointing to a bird perched on a 
telephone wire. "Used to be called the brown towhee, but they changed the 
name." 
</P>
<P>
Within the first half-hour of the birding expedition, Blatt had called out the 
names of two dozen species. "11 o'clock -- there's a Western grebe," he said. 
"Two o'clock -- you've got a Clark's grebe." 
</P>
<P>
The coveted sighting of the day, however, was a shy wanderer from Asia -- a 
rare tufted duck that Blatt had spotted on a visit to Bonelli earlier in the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
For several of Blatt's birders, the tufted duck would be a "life bird," a 
once-in-a-lifetime sighting that could be recorded on a detailed list of 
sightings that serious birders prize. 
</P>
<P>
As the group made its way slowly around the park, discussing rare finds, the 
best habitat for bird sightings and the scholarly names for birds, they also 
talked about their opposition to proposed commercial development of Bonelli 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is kind of a jewel, an oasis for people to come and see what open 
space looks like," Blatt said, noting how much open space has disappeared from 
Southern California since he moved here in 1944. Over the dozen years that he 
has led the count at Bonelli Park, Blatt said, he has seen some species drop 
off his census list. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a cow pasture north of Brackett Air Field, and I got prairie 
falcons there. But they've developed a business center there so those birds are 
gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other birds have dropped out of sight as various streams and ponds in the park 
were filled in for recreational uses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"See, to most people this looks like empty, barren space," Blatt said, 
indicating a cactus- and scrub-covered hillside. "But ecologically, it's a 
community for mammals, birds and insects."

A HEADS-UP BOAT TOUR; 
</P>
<P>
GAGGLES OF GEESE, THOUSANDS OF DUCKS, A MULTITUDE OF SHORE AND LAND BIRDS -- 
AND, FINALLY, A SOARING EAGLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Way out on Lake Cachuma, somewhere between the call of the loon and the honk of 
the Canadian goose, there is the amazing spiel of naturalist Neal Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"At Lake Cachuma we have seeds that walk, spiders that fly, plants that catch 
fish and trees that predict rain," Taylor says to his Eagle Tour passengers 
aboard the Cachuma Queen, "and there are 276 varieties of birds, including 
three dozen species of waterfowl on the lake." 
</P>
<P>
But only one Neal Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's tour-boat passengers are surprised when, in the middle of the lake, he 
cuts the outboard. Soon they will be even more surprised when Taylor begins 
discourses on such topics as capitalism and conservation, differences between 
goldeneyes and common mergansers, the natural history of Spanish moss and how 
to cook a coot. 
</P>
<P>
For a few moments, passengers on the bobbing boat savor the quiet of the lake 
and the reflection of the Santa Ynez Mountains on the water's surface. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor smiles. To say he had a captive audience is supreme understatement. With 
an actor's instinct, the naturalist stretches out his Harold Pinter-like 
dramatic pause until his passengers begin to fidget. He then begins his first 
discourse of the day about Lake Cachuma, which is just northwest of Santa 
Barbara: 
</P>
<P>
"Who's the best fisherman on the lake?" Taylor asks. 
</P>
<P>
"The cormorant," answers a young woman, who, judging from the way she clutches 
her high-powered binoculars, bird checklist and Peterson "Field Guide to 
Western Birds," is a serious bird watcher indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Good guess," Taylor declares. "The cormorant is a big eater, excellent at 
diving for fish. And extremely smart. I swear that bird knows when the trout 
truck arrives and where we'll stock the lake. But actually, the cormorant is 
the third-best fisherman around here." 
</P>
<P>
"The eagle," answers a safari-suited fellow who looks as if he had stepped from 
the pages of the Banana Republic catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
"Another good guess," Taylor says. "The bald eagle's feet are adapted for 
fishing. The eagle has little bumps on its toes so that when it swoops down to 
get a fish swimming close to the lake's surface, the bird can hold onto its 
dinner. The eagle is the second-best fisherman on the lake." 
</P>
<P>
The sly grin working at the corners of Taylor's mouth and the twinkle in his 
eyes lets the passengers know they've been had. "Yeah," he says with mock 
bravado. "You're looking at him." 
</P>
<P>
Groans and laughter are overpowered by the roar of the outboard as Taylor 
throttles the Cachuma Queen toward the north shore. 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect to the eagle and the cormorant, and with all kidding 
aside, Taylor may very well be the best fisherman on the lake. As a teen-ager, 
he won several national casting titles. These days, he teaches "The Art and 
Science of Fly-Fishing," both "academically" at UCLA and "hands-on" in the 
wilds of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a mountain of a man with a winning grin, may be entertaining to tour 
passengers, but he's anything but to the lake's rule-breakers when he finds 
them fishing in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor came to be a park ranger rather late in life because, he says, "I was 
spending too much time in the corporate world and not enough time in the 
natural world." 
</P>
<P>
He spent the better part of two decades as a salesman for a sporting goods 
distributor before becoming Lake Cachuma Recreation Area's park naturalist 
seven years ago. Early attempts to market his tours as water nature trails and 
wildlife cruises were not very successful. Then the eagles discovered Lake 
Cachuma and Taylor and county park officials had a product to market. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor stops the boat again. "This is a free-enterprise lake," he declares. 
"Fees collected for day use, camping and tours completely pay for this park, 
and no local tax dollars have to be collected." 
</P>
<P>
Passengers, expecting to learn about fish, not free enterprise, are a bit 
baffled. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for your support," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor thinks capitalism, in the manner that it's practiced at Lake Cachuma, 
can promote conservation. Fees collected from wildlife-watching tours could go 
to help preserve animals and their habitat. Whale watchers helped save the 
whale, elephant-seal watchers helped save the elephant seal, and perhaps eagle 
watchers can help save the eagle, Taylor reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, on this overcast Friday morning, the eagles are elusive. True, the 
passengers already have sighted gaggles of geese, thousands of ducks and a 
multitude of shore and land birds, but Taylor feels compelled to provide at 
least one glimpse of an eagle on any Eagle Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are they?" Taylor mutters under his breath as he pilots the boat into 
isolated inlets and scans the high crags and snags where the eagles roost. 
</P>
<P>
America's national bird migrates south from the Pacific Northwest and western 
Canada to the warmer climate and more abundant food sources of Central and 
Southern California. Eagles often winter in the same spots preferred by 
migrating waterfowl -- the state's inland lakes such as Cachuma -- where food 
is plentiful and human intrusion is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Cachuma's eagles arrive in November or December and stay until mid-March. 
Wildlife experts believe that birds wintering at Lake Cachuma come from the San 
Juan Islands off the coast of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declining Population 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, there were nesting pairs of bald eagles in 24 
California counties. By 1950, only eight counties could count reproducing 
pairs, the decrease partially attributable to the use of DDT from the 1940s to 
the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"Look!" Taylor cries with a mixture of triumph and relief. "An immature, high 
in that oak tree." 
</P>
<P>
Binoculars are trained on a brownish-black bird, all but camouflaged in the 
branches of the distant tree. The largest raptor in North America (with the 
exception of the captured condors in the Los Angeles and San Diego zoos) is not 
all that majestic from such a distance. 
</P>
<P>
Every Eagle Tour is different, Taylor says. Sometimes passengers get an 
eyeball-to-eyeball look at an eagle perched on a snag near shore. At close 
range, when the observer can see the white head and tail, the large, yellow 
hooked bill and talons, America's national symbol is truly an impressive sight. 
</P>
<P>
"Look!" Taylor exclaims. "High in the sky!" 
</P>
<P>
Eagles in flight are beautiful to behold. Unlike some other large birds, eagles 
soar with their wings almost flat. With a 6- to 8-foot wingspan, they create a 
dramatic and distinctive silhouette against the clear winter sky. 
</P>
<P>
And the flight of this eagle on this day has made Taylor a happy man and 
delights the tour-boat passengers. Now he can talk of other things. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't want the lake at first," Taylor confesses. "It (building a dam 
to impound the Santa Ynez River) half-drowned a beautiful valley and it wrecked 
one of the best steelhead fishing rivers in the state." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chumash Artifacts 
</P>
<P>
A lot of other people disliked the proposal to form the lake, but when 
water-short Santa Barbara resorted to rationing during 1948, the dam and lake 
were approved by local voters. Congress appropriated funds and the project was 
completed in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
The lake also covered up a lot of human history, Taylor says. "My brother and I 
picked up four truckloads of Chumash artifacts and took them over to the Santa 
Barbara Museum of Natural History."

It was the abundance of steelhead trout in the river that brought the Chumash 
to the area and later attracted several generations of anglers. Dedicated 
fishermen say the Santa Ynez River once compared favorably with the Klamath as 
one of the state's best steelhead-fishing rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned with the demise of the trout stream, the California Sport Fishing 
Protection Alliance recently filed a complaint with the State Water Board. The 
alliance wants a study done on how the fishery might be restored. Taylor, too, 
would like to see the wild river of his youth restored, but for now, his 
priority is protecting the lake's 42 miles of shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I regard the lake as a wonderful resource -- as a way to enhance wildlife 
habitat. This is a remarkable place for birds," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For beginning bird watchers who've traveled long distances for the chance to 
sight a bald eagle, it's almost bird-watching blasphemy to opine that eagles 
often are not the most intriguing part of the Eagle Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are sometimes more delighted by the great multitude of birds -- the 
flocks of geese taking flight or the clouds of canvasbacks traveling in long, 
V-shaped formations. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's the antics of the diving ducks that are most remembered. The 
canvasback, a diving duck with a white back, rusty-red head and long black 
bill, is almost always sighted on the lake. And visitors are all but certain to 
see the bufflehead, one of the smallest diving ducks, a chubby white fellow 
with a black back that buzzes more like a fly than a bird. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great Blue Heron 
</P>
<P>
Other divers include the small, brown, pie-billed grebe and its cousin, the 
eared grebe. Because grebes ride stern up in the water, they always seem to be 
in danger of sinking. 
</P>
<P>
The lake's longest-legged resident is the great blue heron. Its long neck, 
regal bearing and great size make it one of the most photogenic of birds, and 
its habit of standing motionless for long periods on one leg make it an easy 
target for amateur photographers. 
</P>
<P>
"Cachuma is a great place for the beginning bird watcher," says Joan Lentz, 
co-author with Judith Young of "Birdwatching: A Guide for Beginners" (Capra 
Press). "There are more than a dozen species of ducks, four species of grebes 
and a couple of loons -- a real wealth of wintering bird life. 
</P>
<P>
"The lake's low water level means you can get fairly close to a lot of water 
birds," Lentz explains, "and don't forget the perching birds in the park's oak 
woodland -- acorn woodpeckers, Western bluebirds, goldfinches, juncos and lots 
of sparrows." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has a breezy approach to bird watching, which may be just what the 
beginner needs to get off to a good start, says author Young, "but, uh, he 
didn't tell his coot story to a boatload of Auduboners, did he?" 
</P>
<P>
Well . . . yes. 
</P>
<P>
"The coot is the Rodney Dangerfield of the bird world," Taylor declares. "It 
doesn't get any respect." 
</P>
<P>
He and the passengers watch one of the gregarious gray, white-billed birds 
skitter over the lake's surface on its huge feet and lunge awkwardly into the 
air. Not only is it a graceless flyer, but it has a grating kakakakaka call. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the ugly duckling-like bird is kind of cute and one serious birder 
nearly drops her binoculars when Taylor blithely asks: "Know how to cook a 
coot?" 
</P>
<P>
None of the cooks on board dares hazard a guess. 
</P>
<P>
"First you pluck it, then leave it in a stream overnight. Then you put an apple 
inside the bird and wire it to a split green log. Smoke the coot over a 
campfire 3 1/2 hours or until golden brown." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone on board but the Auduboner realizes Taylor is pulling their legs. 
</P>
<P>
"Then throw away the coot and eat the apple." 
</P>
<P>
Bobcat, fox and coyote prowl Cachuma's shoreline. About 70 beaver families live 
by the lake. Unlike their river-dwelling cousins, Cachuma's beavers don't build 
dams. Instead, they occupy burrows in the mud banks. 
</P>
<P>
While much wildlife inhabits the lake's shores, a few visitors expect a thrill 
at every turn. "Some visitors expect the Disneyland jungle boat ride," Taylor 
complains. "There aren't any pop-up rhinos and recorded bird calls out here. 
It's all real." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'That's Nature's Way' 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes too real. 
</P>
<P>
On some occasions, the natural history lesson comes from Charles Darwin rather 
than Walt Disney. During one cruise, Taylor maneuvered the tour boat into an 
isolated inlet and he and his passengers watched, enthralled, as not 30 feet 
away a doe and two fawns nibbled at the lakeside brush. It was an idyllic 
scene, pretty as a post card . . . until a mountain lion, with the big cat's 
legendary quickness, burst out of the bushes and killed the doe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to read about survival of the fittest in a textbook; it's 
another thing to see it acted out before your eyes," Taylor comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say it was a little like watching the murder of Bambi," admits 
Taylor, "but that's nature's way and it's not my job to interrupt it." 
</P>
<P>

NUMBERS OF MIGRATORY BIRDS IN SHARP DECLINE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: SUBURBAN TERRITORIES ARE ENCROACHING ON FEEDING GROUNDS. 
SHOREBIRDS AND SONGBIRDS HAVE BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shorebirds that migrate 7,000 miles between their winter homes in Argentina and 
their Arctic nesting grounds make a pit stop every spring on New Jersey beaches 
to feast on horseshoe crab eggs. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey also provides "safe houses" between wintering and nesting grounds 
for many other types of migrating birds, including hawks that follow the 
coastline, the Delaware River and Appalachian ridges and tiny warblers looking 
for food in woodlands and coastal thickets. 
</P>
<P>
Naturalists have noticed alarming declines in the feathered wayfarers. The 
number of sanderling, a species of migrating shorebird, has dropped 50% in a 
decade. Sharpshin hawk populations have fallen dramatically since the New 
Jersey Audubon Society started counting in 1976, and songbirds are 
disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey, the most densely populated state, is crossed by several major bird 
routes, and birds are colliding with a human exodus to rural and shore areas. 
Experts say the disappearing migrants are not only a loss for the Garden State, 
but should serve as an early warning for the entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
Audubon ornithologists blame the drop on increased development of rural and 
coastal areas, which often eliminates bird habitat and erects such hazards as 
airports, highways and plate-glass windows (which birds often fly into). 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that humanity really has to do is ask itself a question: Are birds 
important enough to want to protect?" said Pete Dunne, a veteran birdwatcher. 
"If the answer is yes, then we'd better get with it, because it's going to be a 
long road back." 
</P>
<P>
Migrants are hard to protect because they are vulnerable at so many points. 
Such shorebirds as the red knot and the sanderling could be wiped out by damage 
to their nesting sites high above the Arctic Circle or to their wintering 
range. 
</P>
<P>
But they are at special risk during their long journey, when they cluster at 
refuges like the Delaware Bay, where 80% of North America's sanderling and 40% 
of the red knot gather in mid-May. The birds could not survive the grueling 
flight without a chance to rest. 
</P>
<P>
"Each link in the migratory path offers them something," said Kathleen Clark, a 
zoologist with New Jersey's Division of Endangered and Non-Game Species. 
"Delaware Bay is critical because the food supply is there in such abundance." 
</P>
<P>
At Cape May, an average of 36,000 sharpshin hawks have been counted each year 
since 1976, said Paul Kerlinger, director of the Audubon Society's Cape May 
observatory. But the 1988 count was 19,000 and last year's was just above 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kerlinger said the number of sharpshins counted at some inland observation 
points has also gone down. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows why sharpshin hawks are disappearing or even if the decline is 
permanent or temporary. One hypothesis is that the songbirds they depend on for 
food are dying off, Kerlinger said. Another factor could be plate-glass 
windows, which appear to be a hawk-killer second only to hunting. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Gauthreaux, a Clemson University zoologist, uses old National Weather 
Service radar records to track songbird migrations across the Gulf of Mexico 
from Central America to Louisiana. He estimates that the number of birds making 
the trip has declined 50% in the last 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
Songbirds, which live mostly in deep woods, have been hit by deforestation in 
the tropics and in the United States. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, strips of 
woodland along beach areas provide resting places for migrants before and after 
the flight to Central America, Gauthreaux said, but those "little refuges" are 
now being cut. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing suburbanization of New Jersey's rural areas, with office parks and 
landscaped housing developments replacing forests, provides ideal habitat for 
some wild species. Deer, raccoons, Canada geese and cow birds have become 
pests. Both raccoons, which eat eggs, and cow birds, which use other species' 
nests for their own eggs, play a part in killing off songbirds. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler Robbins, a wildlife biologist at the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge 
in Maryland, observed that many species are doing just fine, spreading into new 
territories. Cardinals have begun nesting in Massachusetts, while a new species 
of cow bird is penetrating Southern states after moving from South America to 
Puerto Rico, where it is crowding out native species. 
</P>
<P>
But thrushes, vireos and many types of warblers are down. 
</P>
<P>
To protect migrants, the Audubon Society suggests: 
</P>
<P>
* Leave rural and shore property as natural as possible, protecting native 
plants that provide food for birds. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit or ban spraying for gypsy moths and mosquitoes. In addition to killing 
pests, insecticides wipe out bugs that some birds eat. 
</P>
<P>
* Cluster housing to preserve woodlands and limit development near the shore. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep cats, which can be efficient bird killers, indoors. Prevent dogs from 
running free. 
</P>
<P>
* Design man-made hazards to accommodate birds. Plate-glass windows can be 
angled downwards so that they do not reflect trees and sky. Red warning lights 
on broadcast towers and skyscrapers attract birds and might be replaced with 
white strobe lights, although that may aggravate humans.

WINDS AID EFFORT TO KEEP OIL FROM HITTING COASTLINE; 
</P>

ENVIRONMENT: TWO-MILE-LONG SLICK FROM TANKER SPILL THREATENS ORANGE COUNTY 
BEACHES AND PRIME WILDLIFE HABITATS. CLEANUP WORK FOCUSES ON SCOOPING UP CRUDE.

Winds kept a two-mile-long slick of Alaskan crude oil from washing ashore 
Thursday, raising hopes that the 300,000-gallon spill -- the worst in Southern 
California in two decades -- can be cleaned up before seriously damaging a 
prized wildlife sancutary and miles of prime Orange County shoreline, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been extremely lucky," said Peter Bontadelli, director of the state 
Department of Fish and Game. "The good weather and offshore breezes have saved 
us thus far. The oil has not hit the beaches." 
</P>
<P>
As scores of anxious environmentalists, local officials and state experts 
monitored its movement, the purplish slick -- about 2 miles long and 4 miles 
wide -- drifted several miles off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said it was too large to encircle with a boom, so clean up efforts 
focused on scooping up the light crude from the damaged tanker, American 
Trader. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials had initially ruled out using chemical dispersants because of 
their toxic nature. But Thursday, the U.S. Coast Guard was seeking permission 
from the U.S Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Fish 
and Game to employ dispersants to break up the slick. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators zeroed in on one of the ship's anchors as the apparent cause of 
the 7,000-barrel spill late Wednesday afternoon in relatively shallow coastal 
waters. The 21-year-old tanker attempted to moor offshore when the portside 
anchor apparently punctured the single-hulled vessel, the ship's owner said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of gallons of oil poured through a 3-foot gash before emergency teams 
halted the leak early Thursday. The tanker, in a routine maneuver, was 
preparing to unload its cargo of crude through underwater pipelines leading to 
a Santa Fe Springs refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The anchor theory was supported by Coast Guard officials. "It's very likely the 
anchor," said Chief Warrant Officer Dan Dewell. "Our investigators have have 
seen the damage to the anchor." Another Coast Guard officer said: "The anchor 
is now bent like a banana." 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the tanker, American Trading Transportation Co. of New York, deployed 
divers to asess the extent of damage to the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost, Jr., who flew to the scene from Washington 
on Thursday, said there is a good chance that virtually all of the spilled oil 
will be removed before it can wash ashore if the weather holds. "I can't tell 
you what percentage will come ashore, but we hope none," Yost told reporters 
gathered near the historic Huntington Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
A stream of local and state politicans descended on Huntington Beach Thursday, 
staging a series of press conferences to voice support for clean up efforts and 
raise questions about oil drilling and tanker movement in Southern California 
coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this oil spill sends a strong message to Sacramento and Washington," 
Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy said at a morning press conference on the beach 
overlooking the spill. "It was just pure dumb luck we didn't have a tragedy. We 
shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner said he would meet 
with President Bush to brief him on the incident, adding that the oil company 
and owners of the tanker expressed their "commitment to me" to help in cleaning 
up the oil. 
</P>
<P>
As the spill clean-up moved into its second day, protests from offshore oil 
drilling opponents grew. 
</P>
<P>
The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization, said 
little comfort could be taken in the fact that the spill had remained offshore 
or that clean up operations were under way. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the flow of oil has been stopped, the ability of the oil industry 
and the government to clean up the 300,000 gallons that were spilled into the 
Pacific Ocean is pathetic," the NRDC said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Edgerton, with the NRDC's Los Angeles office, said, "The spreading slick 
from the impaled American Trader presents an imminent threat to the 
ecologically important wetlands of Bolsa Chica, Anaheim Bay, and Upper Newport, 
some of the healthiest wetlands left in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the warnings, officials said that so far the environmental impact has 
been remarkably minimal from the spill, the worst since the catastrophic 1969 
Santa Barbara spill when 3.2 million gallons of crude fouled beaches for months 
and killed thousands of shore birds. 
</P>
<P>
"We got lucky, it could have been a lot worse," said biologist Victor Leipzig, 
executive director of the Bolsa Chica Conservancy, a grassroots environmental 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach officials, who declared a state of emergency and planned to 
meet Thursday night to map out clean up stratgies should the oil wash ashore, 
kept their fingers crossed that their shoreline would be spared major damage. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been dodging bullets for 24 hours," City Councilman Jim Silva said. 
"This is one of the most popular beaches in California. It would be a shame if 
we lost it." 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen oil-coated birds were rescued Thursday by volunteers and 
biologists, who set up a command post and wildlife treatment center on the sand 
south of the Huntington pier. In all, 25 oil-covered birds have reportedly been 
recovered, of which eight have died. 
</P>
<P>
Fear persisted, however, that the oil would wreck environmental havoc if and 
when it reaches shore. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly if the wind and currents shift and it starts moving in, we're going to 
have what we always said -- significant shoreline impacts," said Brian Baird, 
an oil spill expert with the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and game chief Bontadelli said that if the oil hits the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands, upper Newport Harbor and the mouth of the Santa Ana River it will 
take 2 1/2 years for the ecosystem to recover. The Bolsa Chica wetlands, the 
focus of intense battles between environmentalists and develoeprs, is home to 
dozens of bird species including the Light-footed Clapper Rails and Lest terns, 
both endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
"The wetlands are the key to all marine life as well as shore birds and 
wintering water fowl," Bontadelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Petroleum confirmed Thursday that the spilled oil was 
Alaskan North Slope oil, the same oil that bled from the Exxon Valdez last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
However, California's warmer climate may cause the oil to evaporate sooner than 
it did in Alaska's Prince William Sound, as well as appear lighter in color. 
</P>
<P>
"With warmer water temperatures, the (more volatile components of the oil) 
would (evaporate) quicker," said Charles Webster, BP's manager of crisis 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the persistence of what's left, it's probably not a great deal 
different (from Valdez) except it might remain more liquid than it would if it 
were in an extremely cold climate," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
A federal emergency response team considered attempting to clean up the oil by 
using chemical dispersants or setting the oil slick on fire. But both options 
were ruled out after reviewing the scene, said Kathleen Shimmin of the EPA. 
Both ideas were abandoned because of health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too close to land," Shimmin said. "We would never consider using 
dispersement if mechanical cleanup is working, and in this case it's working . 
. . We'd use putting toxic chemicals into the environment and posing a 
potential hazard to the wildlife to clean up a spill as a last step." 
</P>
<P>
The use of chemical dispersants is controversial because they are toxic to 
marine life and because their effectiveness is uneven, according to the 
National Academy of Sciences. State fish and game officials said that if 
dispersants are used, it would like injury snails, halibut and other 
bottow-dwelling creatures. It could also fish larvae in the spill area. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the trade off for not hitting sensitive coastal areas," said fish and 
game spokesman Curt Taucher. 
</P>
<P>
Ecological experts and environmentalists who visited the scene said the oil 
slick threatens to sicken or kill species all through the aquatic food chain -- 
from the microspic plankton that float in fresh water, through mussels and 
anchiovies and sardines, up to sea lions whose fur can be matted by the crude 
oil, leaving them vulnerable to the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Clean up efforts centered around several large skimming vessels that attempted 
to scoop up the oil. Booms were placed around the front of the tanker to 
contain spilled oil near the hole in the hull, but the size of the larger slick 
made the use of skimmers necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cause of the spill is still under investigation, the ship's owner 
said that alcohol tests performed on the tanker's skipper initially appear to 
be "negative." The results will not be complete, however, for at least two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Murphy, vice president of American Trading, said the company considers the 
tanker's skipper Robert La Ware "an able and experienced seaman." 
</P>
<P>
"He has been with our company 30 years and he's an extremely experienced master 
on the West Coast," Murphy told reporters. "He has put this ship and many 
others on moorings many, many times." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after dawn today, about 150 gawkers and volunteers gathered near the 
Huntington Beach pier to watch the idle tanker offshore and look for oil on the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have lived in Huntington Beach all my life," said Sam Cracchiolo. "But never 
in a million years did I think this would happen here." 
</P>
<P>
Residents as far inland as two miles said they could smell the crude. Police 
dispatchers said they received several dozen calls from concerned residents. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Ted Lempert, chairman of the Assembly Select Committee on Spill 
Prevention, said that the American Trader's ruptured tanks contained about 
20,000 barrels of crude and about 6,000 barrels were lost. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of oil spilled from the American Trader is about 3% of what was 
spilled in the Exxon Valdez tragedy," Lempert said.

<LEADPARA>  Before the fledgling group of bird-watchers even leaves the parking lot at
Coyote Hills Regional Park in Fremont, the priorities of birding are made
clear.;    While leader Alice Hoch is explaining the use of her telescope, she
stops suddenly in mid-sentence to cry out, "Oh, I hear an Allen's hummingbird!"  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BIRDS BRING THIS WORLD TO A STANDSTILL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     All talk ceases. All heads swivel. The elusive hummingbird is spotted,
hovering in the top branches of a eucalyptus tree.;    Once it flies off, Hoch
explains the laws of birding. "If you see or hear a bird, the world stops. You
can always pick up a conversation later. The bird is the most important
thing.";    The 10 birders nod in understanding. They range from first-timers
to those whose field guides are marked with Post-its and pencil jottings. This
one-time walk -- under gray skies -- is sponsored by the Olive Hyde Art Guild
in conjunction with an exhibit of wildlife images at the Hyde gallery in
Mission San Jose. Hoch, one of the area's best known birding instructors,
teaches a regular class through Fremont Adult School.;    An active member of
the Audubon Society, she has birded on five continents -- including a trip
this winter to Venezuela. She holds degrees in chemistry and biochemistry from
the University of Illinois. Her popular classes often have waiting lists.;   
With field glasses at the ready and lists of birds with habitats at Coyote
Hills, the group troops off along the marsh-side path. Hoch leads, firm of
purpose. Soon, she sees a cinnamon teal duck.;    "Scope, please," she
requests. Telescope and tripod in position, Hoch aims it and invites
participants to view the colorful duck up close and ornithological.;    Later,
spotting a red-winged blackbird preening on a branch, Hoch throws herself into
the interpretive role, doing a fine imitation of the bird raising its bright
feathers like epaulets. "I am a male red-wing blackbird," she announces,
lifting her shoulders. "All others stay away from this area." As the group
walks, pauses, searches the tules for signs of feathers, a great blue heron
flew overhead. "You noticed it wasn't blue?" Hoch asks. Check. Quick notes on
the list.;    Focusing on birds through binoculars is an acquired skill --
especially when the operator is also fumbling through the pages of "Birds of
North America." "Practice in your back yard," Hoch suggests.;    While it's
generally acknowledged that birding is a benign, contemplative activity, other
aspects emerge. There's technology. Rather than wait for a Virginia rail to
appear in the marsh, Hoch aims her tape recorder off over the tules and plays
the call of the rail. It sounds like, "Click, click, chuff, chuff." There is,
unfortunately, no response from the Virginia rail this time.;    There's
drama: "I was with her (Hoch) when she saw the purple gallinule," confides
Florine Williamson of Fremont.;    True, Hoch says. Four years ago, she
spotted the rare bird near Lake Elizabeth in Fremont. "It was only the second
recorded sighting in California," she says. "Once it was confirmed, the next
day the three top birders from Southern California were up here looking at it.
Eventually, hundreds of people came to see it." (The bird is more common in
the Everglades or Latin America.);    There's ethics: Hoch tells the
cautionary story of an eager new birder who asked the trip leader about a
quick-moving bird, "Did you see it well enough for me to check off?";    That
novice was unclear on the concept. You don't check off a bird unless you
really see it yourself. (For her own information, Hoch does use a different
notation system to mark birds that others have sighted.);    Between sightings
and tales of former sightings, the walkers muse on the intertwining strands of
ecology and history in the Fremont area. Al Box notes that the marshland is
drying up near the boardwalk at the Stivers Lagoon area of Central Park.
Bernie Leal says, "My grandfather told me that the covered wagons used to stop
at Stivers Lagoon and feed their stock before taking off through Mission
Pass.";    Light mist turns to rain. The outline of the hills is blurred, the
silhouettes of the trees soften. The group disappears around a bend in the
trail, like small figures in a serene Asian painting. Who knows what snowy
egrets or ruddy ducks lie ahead. But the day is already a success for one
birder.;    "It just made my day to see that cinnamon teal," Jan Tremewan
said. "That's what I came out here for."; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Alice Hoch's
next series of Tuesday morning birding field trips begins June 18. Cost is $64
for seven classes. Pre-registration is required. For information, call the

FT  17 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: Watch on the Danube - A look
at Romania's bid to save a damaged delta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank is this month due to grant Romania Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 3m)
to help preserve the Danube delta, Europe's largest remaining wetland and
one of its most important wildlife sanctuaries, which is under increasing
threat from industrial pollution.
After years of mismanagement under Romania's former communist regime, the
delta's unique ecosystems are being destroyed by the pollutants and waste
accumulated by the River Danube on its 2,700km journey through the
industrial heartland of Europe.
The delta covers 580,000ha in eastern Romania and southern Ukraine where the
Danube splits into three main branches and enters the Black Sea.
For centuries, it has provided a sanctuary for rare birds, fish and
wildlife, as well as for persecuted human beings.
It is home to more than 75 species of fish, rare mammals such as the
European mink and wild cat, and an estimated 300 species of birds including
Dalmatian pelicans, pygmy cormorants, red-breasted geese, glossy ibis and
several kinds of egret and heron.
Its few thousand human inhabitants are mainly descendants of ethnic
Ukrainians and Russians driven out of tsarist Russia in the 17th and 18th
centuries because of their religious beliefs. In 1991, Unesco (the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) added the delta
to its World Heritage list.
But the region is more than just an area of beauty and environmental
interest.
'The delta is a natural buffer between the Danube and the Black Sea,' says
Irina Luca, project officer for the World Bank in Bucharest.
'Its vegetation filters out pollutants and purifies water from the river
before it enters the sea. This is very important given the high levels of
pollution already found in the Black Sea.'
One of the first acts of Romania's post-communist government in 1990 was to
halt all building and land reclamation projects in the delta, to designate
the region a protected biosphere area and to set up the Danube Delta
Biosphere Reserve Authority to administer it.
The World Bank grant, made from its Global Environment Facility, will be
used to reverse some of the damage done in the past 50 years and to
strengthen the authority, which is based in the port of Tulcea where the
delta begins.
One aim of the five-year project is to restore reed banks and land reclaimed
by the communists for agricultural use to their natural state. Reeds, which
cover about one-third of the delta, are particularly important - it is in
compact reed banks that water from the Danube is trapped and filtered, says
Grigore Baboianu, the authority's executive director.
The country's former rulers saw the reeds as a cheap source of cellulose for
paper manufacturing. In the 1950s, plans were drawn up to harvest half a
million tonnes a year from the delta. Although this target was never
reached, Baboianu says large areas of reeds were destroyed or damaged by
heavy harvesting equipment.
Another important aim of the project is to prevent further damage to the
delta.
Around one-third of the World Bank grant will be used to strengthen the
authority's supervisory and administrative functions.
A law passed last December gave it wide-ranging powers, including
responsibility for licensing fishing and other commercial activities and the
right to fine those who fail to respect environmental protection rules.
Shipping and other companies, for example, can be fined for discharging
dirty water into the delta and individuals for fishing without a permit.
In practice, however, the authority has had insufficient funds to carry out
its tasks adequately. 'At the moment, we have just 90 wardens - one for
every 4,000-5,000ha - and no way of contacting them in the field,' says
Baboianu. The grant will be used to increase the number of wardens to 250,
to train them and to buy equipment such as boats, binoculars and radios.
Wardens monitor the environment and wildlife in their districts and check
that regulations are adhered to. The emphasis is on working with local
communities, which are among the poorest and most isolated in Romania and
whose people live from the land and from fishing and hunting. Most can only
be reached by boat.
Baboianu says: 'We do have problems with poachers and with people
misunderstanding our role, but we do not want to be seen as a force against
the people. We hope we can convince them to look on us as some kind of
ecological vet, helping preserve and improve the area for everyone.'
A greater problem is protecting the delta from pollutants in the Danube,
especially fertilisers, phosphates and nutrients used in intensive farming.
Their excessive use has led to eutrophication, manifested by an explosion of
algae.
'This phenomenon is very dangerous for us. Algae cover the surface of the
water and block light and oxygen for the more complex water plants and
animals below, eventually killing them,' says Baboianu.
This problem cannot be solved without co-operation from other Danube and
Black Sea countries, many of which, like Romania, are undergoing difficult
transitions to a market economy and can ill afford environmental clean-up
projects. 'We've made a start,' says Baboianu, 'but we can't look at the
delta in isolation. We also need to solve the problems upstream and
downstream.'

<HEAD>Starling Advocate Takes Flak For Defense Of Maligned Bird</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mark Spreyer doesn't mind when people say his job
is for the birds. Even his business cards read: ``Mark Spreyer, the
naturalist nobody likes, defending the species nobody wants.
Starlings my speciality.''
   Spreyer never meant to become an advocate for one of the
nation's least-liked birds, but the 31-year-old ornithologist for
the Chicago Academy of Sciences thinks they're getting a bad rap as
messy invaders who take over other birds' turf.
   He recently delivered a lecture titled ``In Defense of
Starlings'' before the National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association
in Denver, and he has also spoken on the birds' behalf in New York
and Orlando, Fla.
   He even has one for a pet. Rod Starling shares Spreyer's
suburban Barrington apartment, has learned to talk and has been
known to fly to the telephone when it rings and get the receiver
off the hook.
   Some of Spreyer's enthusiasm has caught on, according to a local
veterinarian, Peregrine Wolff, interviewed by the Chicago Sun-Times
recently after encountering Spreyer's pet.
   ``My opinion of starlings was not very high before I met this
bird,'' said Ms. Wolff, who said Rod imitated Spreyer's telephone
bell and answering-machine beep, and then in a Hitchcockian twist,
said clearly, ``This is Mark Spreyer.''
   Starlings are related to talking myna birds, and Spreyer said
Sunday their talent as mimics helped them wing their way into his
heart. ``I'm embarrassed to admit it now, but eight years ago, I
used to consider them as owl food,'' said Spreyer.
   Spreyer became better acquainted with starlings two years ago
while preparing for a lecture on urban wildlife, which includes
other European imports such as house sparrows and pigeons.
   ``People are trained to think all introduced things are bad and
all native things are good,'' Spreyer said Sunday. ``I've come to
realize that we have to deal with the environment as it is today.''
   Starlings, which often gather in large, noisy flocks, have
gotten an undeservedly bad reputation as mess-makers and nuisances,
while their good points are overlooked, he said.
   The black songbirds use a completely different food source than
other birds, he said.
   While most birds have strong squeezing muscles in their beaks to
enable them to crack nuts, for example, starlings have mighty
muscles for prying things open, adapting them perfectly for digging
up cutworms and other pests.
   Groundskeepers at some golf courses welcome starlings, which
reduce the need for pesticides, Spreyer said.
   ``There are plenty of other birds that make a mess,'' and the
starling's reputation for displacing native birds with aggressive
nesting habits is overblown, he said.
   Some critics remain unconvinced, including Ron Ogden, Illinois
director of animal-damage control for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
   ``They've gotten a bad rap because they're bad birds,'' he told
the Sun-Times. ``I can't believe anybody would be talking up
starlings after all the damage they've caused. ... I know Mark, I
like him, but he doesn't have to deal with them every day like I
do. They give me fits.''
   Ogden said crews have been pruning trees around the old state
Capitol in Springfield to evict non-native starlings whose
droppings made a ``teetotal mess.''

A CANTICLE FOR KIRGHIZIA; 
</P>
<P>
THE PLACE OF THE SKULL BY CHINGIZ AITMATOV; TRANSLATED BY NATASHA WARD (GROVE 
PRESS: $20.95; 310 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Clark, Berkeley writer Clark's latest novel is The Exile of Celine 
(Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This unusual and highly uneven novel, powerfully evocative of place, is set in 
remote regions of Central Asia that will seem as exotic to most Western readers 
as distant planets: the Issyk-Kul Ridge of Kirghizia, a wild upland country of 
treacherous, forbidding glaciers and ravines, and the vast steppes of Moyun-Kum 
in neighboring Kazakhstan, in summer a bountiful, sun-baked expanse of wild 
grasses, reigned over by noble birds of prey and grazed by fleet saigak, or 
antelope, and in winter a desolate, "boundless white ocean, frozen in waves." 
</P>
<P>
It is a deep love of these lands, along with a strong faith in the redemptive 
power of unorthodox Christian religious beliefs, that forms the basis of values 
used by 61-year-old Soviet novelist Chingiz Aitmatov -- himself a Kirghiz 
native son -- as a platform for this extended moral tract in the form of a 
novel. Hailed in the West as a progressive literary breakthrough made possible 
by the new freedoms of expression brought on by glasnost (and excerpted by Time 
for its putative controversial content), "The Place of the Skull" is in fact, 
and in method, far more traditional than modern, laden with sermonizing and 
severely limited by old social realist narrative modes. The strength of the 
book lies not in its political critique, but in its moments of poetic vision, 
contained in passages of lyric response to the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
The book is divided into two complementary parts, titled "Man" and "Wolf." At 
the outset of "Man," Aitmatov follows the fortunes of a she-wolf and her mate, 
driven by man's intrusions out of savannah hunting grounds whose beauties are 
limned in an uplifting prose disclosing the novelist's evident familiarity with 
and affection for the pristine wilderness of the Moyun-Kum. 
</P>
<P>
"In that evening hour a whole flock of white-tailed kites was circling high 
above the earth. They flew smoothly and aimlessly, simply for the joy of it, in 
the faint haze of the cool, cloudless heights. Round and round they circled, as 
though to symbolize the eternal stability of the land and of the sky, silently 
observing the life down below them on the earth. Thanks to their exceptional, 
omnipotent vision (their hearing is vastly inferior), these aristocratic birds 
of prey live their whole lives in the heavens above the savannah, descending to 
the sinful earth only to eat and sleep." 
</P>
<P>
The vantage soon descends, however, to that sinful Earth. Breaking into the 
peaceful natural paradise is a raiding party of armed mercenary roughnecks in 
jeeps and helicopters, dispatched by local officials to top off the regional 
Five-Year-Plan meat quota by slaughtering the saigak. Caught in the ensuing 
stampede, the wolves' cubs are crushed, the parents wounded and forced to flee. 
</P>
<P>
The only one of Aitmatov's human intruders to approach the wild lands with an 
interest not arising from sheer rapacity, a deacon's son and former seminarian 
named Avdiy Kallistratov, becomes the focus of the action through the remainder 
of the book's first part. A self-appointed, well-meaning ethical crusader bent 
on the moral reformation of a band of teen-age drug smugglers, Avdiy joins 
their expedition into the steppes to gather anasha, the wild cannabis plant 
that grows there in profusion. When his companions discover his motive is not 
the profits of the weed but his own obscure idealism, they beat him up and 
fling him from a speeding train in the middle of nowhere. At this point the 
persecuted Avdiy is seized by a vision of Christ conversing with Pontius 
Pilate. The scene carries obvious echoes of the Christ-Pilate confrontation in 
Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita" and seems to confirm a link with 
Dostoevsky as well (though Aitmatov's Christ-like Avdiy, it must be said, is 
drawn with little of the subtlety of his famous Russian forerunner's saintly 
Alyosha). 
</P>
<P>
Rescued and recovered, Avdiy is briefly consoled by a comely scientific 
researcher who shares his hatred of anasha (in fact she's employed in a 
government campaign to eradicate the "evil weed"). But their romance ends when 
a misunderstanding bred of a missed rendezvous leads to his rash enlistment in 
the saigak hunt, which proves as disastrous for him as for the defenseless 
antelope. 
</P>
<P>
In "Wolf," the setting shifts to the Issyk-Kul mountains, where the migrating 
she-wolf and her mate are found dwelling in uneasy proximity to local 
shepherds. Here Aitmatov introduces a second main character, the "model worker" 
Boston Urkunchiev. Urkunchiev, another goody-good with an earnest 
conscientiousness to match Avdiy's religious fervor, clashes with the 
inflexible head of the state collective farm. The latter figure refuses his 
request for private grazing lands and colludes with Noigutov, the teetotalling 
Urkunchiev's envious, vodka-swilling rival, to bring about his downfall. There 
is one last fatal encounter between man and wolf, after which the reader is 
left to ponder the "eternal riddle of why evil almost always triumphs over 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Human evil and virtue are indeed Aitmatov's chosen protagonists, but his human 
characters come off seeming hardly more real than cartoon stick-figures, and 
his true heroes, righteous intentions aside, are the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the principal message put forward in Aitmatov's preachings -- a stern 
injunction against contemporary people's wasteful, foolhardy and thoughtless 
defilement of the Earth, and of each other -- is a commendable one. The problem 
with "The Place of the Skull" is that the message is given entirely too much 
sway over the novelistic medium, unfortunately (and ironically) turning the 
latter into its own kind of oppressed beast of burden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 -- From "The Place of the Skull" 
</P>
<P>
Daylight brought a slight thaw, brief and elusive as the breath of a child, on 
the south-facing slopes of the mountains; then, imperceptibly, the weather 
changed: the wind blew down off the glaciers and a penetrating darkness stole 
up the ravines, trailing behind it the cold pearly-grey of a snowy night ahead. 
Snow was everywhere. The whole length of the Issyk-Kul ridge lay buried by the 
blizzard that had swept through a couple of days before with the wild rage of a 
forest fire. Such storms could be a terrifying thing, as the snowy darkness 
swallowed up mountains, sky and the whole of the visible world. Later the 
raging ceased, and a clearer sky broke through. Since then the mountains had 
stood in frozen silence, imprisoned and isolated from the rest of creation by a 
mantle of ice. 
</P>
<P>
The only sound was the growing roar of a heavyweight helicopter, cutting up 
through the canyon of the Unzun-Chat to the frozen wastes of the pass at 
Ala-Mongyu, half visible in the evening light and the curling wisps of cloud; 
closer and louder it grew, until at last, triumphant, it filled with its 
thundering clatter the ridges and peaks, the untouched snows where the only 
trespassers were light and sound. Echoing off the rock-safe and the screes, the 
sound grew with such inexorable power that the mountains seemed poised for a 
repeat of the recent earthquake, remembered with horror by all in those parts. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly something cracked and a stony slope, denuded by the winds, directly 
beneath the path of the helicopter, started to move. Shuddering as the 
sound-wave reached it, a bank of scree ran down but was quickly stilled, like 
the flow of blood at the utterance of a charm. So unstable was the surface, 
however, that even this small movement was enough to send a few of the heavier 
stones crashing down the slope, gaining speed, raising dust and chips in their 
wake, until they burst at the foot like canon-balls through the bushes of 
krasnotal and barberry, and tunneled through the deeper drifts to thunder down 
onto the roof of a lair which the grey wolves had burrowed out in a cleft 
beneath the overhang, tucked between a thicket and a small, half-frozen but 
gradually thawing spring.

BATTLE OVER DEVELOPING WETLANDS IS NEARING END; 
</P>

ENVIRONMENT: A DEVELOPER WHO SHARES APPRECIATION FOR ECOLOGY OFFERS A SOLUTION 
TO PROTRACTED STRUGGLE.

<P>
As winter approaches, the great blue herons and snowy egrets return to the 
Ballona Wetlands, a quiet refuge for wildlife surrounded by some of the most 
intensely developed and valuable real estate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This tranquil open space between the Westchester Bluffs and Marina del Rey 
offers migratory birds a safe harbor from the frenetic urban landscape next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the peacefulness has belied a pitched behind-the-scenes battle 
between environmentalists determined to save one of the last remaining wetlands 
in Los Angeles County and developers intent on building a massive multi-use 
complex known as Playa Vista. 
</P>
<P>
But now, with a new developer, who apparently shares an appreciation for the 
environmental significance of the land, an end to the protracted battle over 
Ballona Wetlands appears to be at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Although the environmentalists of Friends of Ballona Wetlands and the new 
developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, have yet to sign a formal settlement ending 
a 5-year-old lawsuit, both sides express confidence that a final agreement will 
be reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting very close," said Carlyle Hall, attorney for the Friends. "We've 
made very substantial progress on most major issues." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson C. Rising, head of the development team for Maguire Thomas, agreed: 
"Things are moving along very nicely. It does take time. But the spirit in 
which the negotiations are taking place is a very constructive atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the settlement talks is a commitment by Maguire Thomas to 
save 270 acres of wetlands for the herons, the egrets, and nearly 200 other 
species of birds that call Ballona home at some point each year. 
</P>
<P>
The plans for the wetlands include such public facilities as an $8-million 
nature center with trails and exhibits that would be run by the National 
Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, the vast property west of the San Diego Freeway and south of 
Marina del Rey had been the province of the Summa Corp., founded by the late 
industrialist Howard Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas purchased the 887-acre site from Summa Corp. in February and 
immediately began trying to clear the way for the development of the remaining 
600-plus acres of Playa Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit by the Friends of Ballona Wetlands has been one of the biggest 
impediments to development of Playa Vista. The Los Angeles Superior Court suit 
challenged governmental approvals for the Summa project. Uncertainty created by 
the suit stopped Summa from moving forward with plans to erect a small city of 
high-rise office buildings, as well as commercial and residential structures. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys and officials of the Friends describe a night-and-day difference in 
attitude between Summa and Maguire Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a very different feel and sensitivity to the environment, the 
wetlands and the overall neighborhood," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after Maguire Thomas entered the picture, a new team of 
planners began work on a revised plan that would eliminate the soaring office 
towers, scale back office space to 5 million square feet, reduce the commercial 
space and increase the number of residential units to 11,750. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas also began talks with the Friends aimed at settling the wetlands 
controversy that had stymied Summa. 
</P>
<P>
After months of negotiations, attorneys told a Superior Court judge last 
Tuesday that they are moving toward an agreement. A referee is expected to be 
named to mediate the remaining issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The settlement we are talking about is an excellent one in which everyone will 
benefit," Hall said. "Everybody is moving in the same direction. It is just a 
matter of resolving various points." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides say Maguire Thomas has agreed to save all of the wetland area west 
of Lincoln Boulevard from the base of the Westchester Bluffs north to Ballona 
Creek. The only exception is a swath of land of about 50 acres west of Lincoln 
that lies between Culver and Jefferson boulevards, which will be developed. 
</P>
<P>
The developer will commit $10 million to wetlands restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The National Audubon Society is expected to provide $8 million for the 
interpretive center it plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been wanting to restore this wetland for a long time," said Glenn Olson, 
vice president of the National Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
The nature center's exhibits, Olson said, will explain why wetlands "aren't 
just mosquito breeding grounds or places for shopping carts to rust." 
</P>
<P>
But before the lawsuit can be settled, Maguire Thomas wants certain assurances, 
including a commitment by the 1,500-member Friends organization to support a 
consensus plan for development. Rising stressed that "the lawsuit can't be 
settled" until all parties agree, and that includes the city and county of Los 
Angeles and the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas wants the city, county and commission to agree to process and 
review all plans, environmental documents and requests for zoning approval as 
expeditiously as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The developer also wants to abandon Summa's plans to build an extension of 
Falmouth Avenue through the wetlands. Maguire Thomas' desire not to build the 
roadway has drawn kudos from the Friends but is the subject of negotiations 
with the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
As lawyers and planners debate the future of the wetlands, environmentalists 
continue to educate the public about their importance. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Sunday, Ed Tarvyd, professor of marine biology at Santa Monica 
College, told small groups of bird watchers and interested observers that the 
Ballona Wetlands are "very, very important to wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
Birds migrating from Alaska to South America along the Pacific Flyway use the 
wetlands as a place to stop and feed before moving on. Halibut and northern 
anchovy use the side channels of Ballona Creek for breeding -- "a nursery for 
offshore fishing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40% of the wild bird species found in California have been seen at 
Ballona, the last remaining saltwater wetland between Malibu and Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Farther down the Ballona Creek levee, Loyola Marymount University biology 
instructor Howard Towner had telescopes trained on the egrets and herons. 
</P>
<P>
Towner said the wetlands are home to at least two endangered species of birds 
-- the California least tern and Belding's savannah sparrow. Other endangered 
species such as bald eagles and peregrine falcons have been seen in the area. 
</P>
<P>
PROTECTED WETLANDS 
</P>

<P>
Years ago, before the word development was uttered anywhere near its edges, the 
wetlands on the old Hellman Ranch in Seal Beach were teeming with birds -- owls 
and sparrows, migrating blue herons and egrets. 
</P>
<P>
But over the years, what environmentalists say was once about 100 acres of 
marshy nesting grounds for avians has largely disappeared, leaving what they 
say is today about 26 acres of severely degraded wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The Wetlands Restoration Society, a Seal Beach environmental group, would like 
to see the wetlands restored in their entirety, but the property they are a 
part of -- a parcel situated north of Pacific Coast Highway and west of Seal 
Beach Boulevard, is zoned for residential use, and developers have proposed to 
build hundreds of houses on it. 
</P>
<P>
The Mola Development Co. of Newport Beach has for several years been submitting 
proposals to build on the property. Its latest proposal calls for 355 
single-family houses on 149 acres that was once part of Hellman Ranch. It is 
the largest undeveloped area in Seal Beach to be zoned for residential use. 
</P>
<P>
Mola disputes environmentalists' claims that the wetlands ever comprised 100 
acres at any time in this century. Company project manager Kirk Evans said that 
as part of its development agreement with the city, the firm has promised to 
restore the 26 acres of wetlands there now, plus another 10 acres. . 
</P>
<P>
That promise, however, is not enough for the Restoration Society, which was 
formed two years ago and now has about 150 members. The group opposes any 
development that would encroach on what they see as the original 100 acres of 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the society wants to see the development confined to just 20 acres on 
a hillside next to Seal Beach Boulevard overlooking the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we've built up so much, should we continue?" said Galen Ambrose, 
one of the society's founders. 
</P>
<P>
Although what Mola proposes to do with the wetlands would be an improvement, 
Ambrose said, their plans still would result in a destruction of bird habitats. 
</P>
<P>
The wetlands are under what is known as the Pacific Flyway, a path birds use on 
their migrations north or south, Ambrose said. The birds stop to rest and feed 
in the big swampy areas under the flyway, so that any building near the 
wetlands will make them less appealing to the birds. 
</P>
<P>
"If you build out everything, there is nothing left to use anymore," Ambrose 
said. "When the birds go, that's a sign that humanity is going." 
</P>
<P>
The El Dorado chapter of the National Audubon Society of Long Beach also 
opposes the development, according to chapter representative Mary Parsell. 
</P>
<P>
The chapter has been monitoring the wetlands for the past 10 years, and it has 
determined that it is one of the homes of the the Belding's savannah sparrow, 
an endangered species in California, Parsell said. 
</P>
<P>
Parsell said that the sparrow, which is native to Southern California, does not 
migrate. Therefore, she said, the loss of a nesting place will further reduce 
the bird's chances of survival. 
</P>
<P>
Evans disagrees with that view, arguing that the company's improvements to the 
wetlands will aid any wildlife there. The company will, Evans said, return 
tidal flow to the wetlands and also replant native flora such as pickle weed, 
one of the plants in which the endangered sparrow nests, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report prepared by consultants for the city shows that 
the project will not be harmful to the wetlands, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where we are taking a tree away, we are replacing it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company knows that it must not infringe upon the wetlands, Evans said. In 
1988, the state Coastal Commission rejected a previous -- and also 
city-approved -- plan for the Hellman Ranch property to build 770 single-family 
houses and a golf course because the project would have encroached on six acres 
of wetlands, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seal Beach City Council is scheduled to consider granting final approval to 
the project Oct. 9, but the real test will come when the Coastal Commission, 
which has the final say, considers the matter. The commission is scheduled to 
hear the proposal during the week of Nov. 13, according to Charles Damm, 
director of the commission's South Coast District. 
</P>
<P>
Damm said the commission staff will evaluate the project to determine how it 
would affect the wetlands and whether it would provide appropriate recreational 
facilities and public access, and whether any geological hazards have been 
addressed. The staff is to present its recommendation to the commission around 
Nov. 1, Damm said.

Bye-Bye Birdies -- Theories abounded among local birders earlier this season to 
explain the exceptionally low numbers of migrating birds passing through the 
county. Had the escalating destruction of wintering grounds in the tropics 
taken a sudden and devastating toll? 
</P>
<P>
But a late rush of migrating land birds started early this month and reached a 
big peak a couple of weeks ago. On one day in Huntington Central Park, for 
instance, the avian display included a count of 125 yellow warblers and 100 to 
150 Swainson's thrushes. "It was really impressive," said Doug Willick, who 
keeps track of rare local sightings for American Bird magazine. "That was 
encouraging after a very disappointing April." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the usual Pacific Flyway travelers have come a number of vagrants 
that strayed from other migratory paths. A number of rare fall vagrants that 
are very rare as spring vagrants in the county have been spotted in recent 
weeks. Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee warbler (three different individuals), May 17, 20 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
* Indigo bunting (two individuals), May 4 to 6 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
* Northern waterthrush, May 3. 
</P>
<P>
* Black and white warbler, May 29. 
</P>
<P>
* Gray flycatcher, April 15. 
</P>
<P>
* Summer tanager, May 20. 
</P>
<P>
* Franklin's gull, May 14. 
</P>
<P>
On May 20, a spotted redshank was seen just south of Orange County on Camp 
Pendleton. The Asiatic shore bird, a rare vagrant in the United States outside 
of the Aleutian Islands, has never been seen before in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Making several appearances in recent weeks on the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh 
Reserve in Irvine has been an American bittern, a member of the heron family. 
"They didn't use to be rare, but numbers in Southern California have really 
dwindled," Willick said. At one time, the birds bred in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
While the passage of spring migrants through the county is now waning, the 
number of rare and unusual vagrants should pick up for the next several weeks. 
These birds are probably straggling, Willick said, because they are lost far 
from their usual migratory paths. The vagrants provide an added challenge to 
avid birders and can make for additions to life lists (a birder's list of birds 
seen). 
</P>
<P>
Quail Hill Update -- The city of Irvine has already announced plans to preserve 
Quail Hill, the spot where thousands of migrating Canada geese spend the winter 
each year. Now it's time to decide what will happen to the land behind Quail 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
On both the city and county plans it is part of William R. Mason Regional Park. 
It has not been developed, however, and is now open space and strawberry 
fields. The land is leased from the Irvine Co., and if the county wants to keep 
that arrangement it has to show improvements on the property by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The county pitched a plan to build a golf course and hotel on the property but 
met a less-than-enthusiastic response from the City Council. Some Irvine 
officials, meanwhile, would like to restore the area to something approaching a 
natural state, with native plants and trees and winding trails. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to that effect are being drawn up by a city administrative aide. 
</P>
<P>
New Checklist -- UC Irvine's Museum of Systematic Biology has published a new 
"Checklist of the Vascular Plants of Orange County, California," the first time 
the list has been updated since 1968. Fred Roberts of the museum compiled the 
work, which will serve as the framework for the first-ever complete flora for 
the county, due to be published sometime after 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The checklist includes all native, introduced, naturalized or escaped species 
of vascular plants that have become established or persist as part of the 
county's flora. As presently known, the flora of Orange County includes 1,157 
species of vascular plants with an additional 99 subspecies or variations, for 
a total of 1,256 taxa. Of the total, 806 are native to the county. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the checklist are available at several locations, including the 
Museum of Natural History and Science in Newport Beach.

   Everyone knows what to do with a bird's wishbone. 
But what does the bird do with it? 

   For scientists who've longed for an answer to that question while tugging at the wishbone -- or pullie bone, as it's also called -- after Sunday dinner, their wish may have finally come true. 
Two Harvard University paleontologists and a Northern Arizona University physiologist say they have figured out the secret of the wishbone. 

   To find the answer, the three scientists put some starlings in a wind tunnel and took X-ray movies of the birds' skeletons as they flew in winds ranging from 20 to 40 miles per hour. 
The movies show that the furcula, as the wishbone is known technically, acts like a spring when a bird is flying, report Farish Jenkens and Kenneth Dial of Harvard and Ted Goslow of Northern Arizona University in the current issue of the journal Science. 

   When the birds are at rest, the two tips of the wishbone are about half an inch apart, the researchers say. 
But when the wings are stroking downward during flight the tips spread out until they are about three-quarters of an inch apart at the end of the downstroke. 
On the upstroke of the wings, the tips spring back to their original position. 

   The scientists also found that the breastbone, or sternum, located just behind the wishbone's junction, moves up and down during flight. 

   What good is all this to the bird? 
The scientists speculate that these moving bones push air through the bird's body during flight. 
They base their theory on the air sacs that birds have scattered through their bodies, including some between the prongs of the wishbone and others near the breastbone. 
It's possible, the scientists say, that the moving bones alternately deflate and expand the air sacs, forcing air from one sac to another during flight. 

   Starlings, for example, only inhale and exhale three times a second, while their wings flap 12 to 16 times a second. 
So, the scientists theorize, the springy wishbone and moving breastbone may be a way of moving air about the body between breaths. 

   Now, if they could only figure out what the appendix is for.

<HEAD>Great Blue Heron Turns Goldfish Pond into Snack Bar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big Bird, a great blue heron, has turned Vivianna
Biesen's goldfish pond into a snack bar.
   Over the past two weeks, the usually shy creature has shamelessly
reduced the population in the 25-foot pond, where she and her
husband have raised goldfish for 20 years, from 100 fish to 60, she
said.
   ``What does Big Bird think that pond is, Midget Sound?'' she
said. The bird ``comes for breakfast, lunch, dinner and in-between
snacks.''
   ``If the fish he plucks from the pond are too big, he flips them
on gravel near the pond,'' she said. ``The others? One gulp and they
are gone.''
   She spread rakes, brooms, 2-by-4 boards and shelves across the
pond, but ``they only provided better perches for the heron to
gobble fish,'' she said.
   ``As urban problems go, this one is pretty unusual,'' said Debbie
Booker, a state Wildlife Department administrative assistant. ``We
gets calls about starlings between walls, squirrels in attics,
raccoons eating cat food in outside dishes, coyotes invading
neighborhoods, but blue heron problems are rare.''
   At the agency's suggestion, Biesen spread chicken wire over the
pond, but Big Bird simply walked on the wire and continued its
forays through the mesh. Finally, last week, she lowered the water
in the pond to 2 feet from 3{ feet.
   ``The fish may have to swim sideways, but I haven't seen that Big
Bird catch any of them yet,'' she said. ``He comes back regularly
and walks the wire, but he apparently can't reach the fish.''
   Biesen said she isn't sure what she'll try next if Big Bird gets
to the fish again.
   Killing a blue heron carries up to a $500 fine and 90 days in
jail, said John Gillespie, the state agency's assistant enforcement
chief.
   Wildlife officials have suggested loud music, gunfire or a net
canopy of the sort used to halt poaching at fish hatcheries as
alternatives.

MALLARD 
</P>
<P>
(Anas platyrhynchos) 
</P>
<P>
Description: The male is readily identified by metallic green head and neck, 
yellow bill and narrow white collar, with chestnut-colored breast; black 
central tail feathers curl up. Both sexes have white tail, white underwings, 
bright blue speculum with both sides bordered in white. Females have orange 
bill with black markings. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Can be found in shallow ponds, lakes, marshes and flooded fields. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Seeds and shoots of sedge, grass and aquatic vegetation, grain, acorns, 
insects and aquatic inverts. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Displays are frequent, but subtle and brief. Males swim with heads 
and tails shaking, with breast clear of water with necks outstretched. They 
also raise their wingtips, heads and tails briefly. Females often incite 
displays to provoke males to attack other males or females. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Usually near water; of cattails, reeds, grass, concealed by vegetation. 
Most nest on ground. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Females usually lay eight to 10 dull yellow or greenish eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Mallards are seasonally monogamous, switching mates each 
year. Male territorial defense is centered on female. Male deserts after first 
week of incubation to join male flocks. 
</P>
<P>

'THERE, Roger, There] Ooooohhh, Yeesss]'
I was sitting in a bright green and yellow six-wheeled truck with buffalo
horns wired to the bonnet and rows of old cinema seats in the back, and
beside me was a girl so excited she was almost dribbling in my ear. It was
irritating. My name is not Roger. There are moments when I wonder why I like
travel.
There were about a dozen of us in the truck, an old Swedish army vehicle
that had seen more African miles than a truck deserves to. Currently it was
in the service of a tour company that takes prawn-pink European tourists
into the dusty countryside of southern Gambia and shows them the sights.
The excited squeaks and coos had begun early in the morning, before we had
even left the strip of Atlantic coast where the tourist hotels range the
beach. Roger was sitting on one side of the truck, Jane on the other. Both
had binoculars to their eyes, cameras around their necks. Never had two more
enthusiastic discoverers set foot in Africa. It took me some time to work
out what it was they were discovering.
'Yaaaah]', Jane would let loose a barely restrained shriek, rocking the seat
beside me. 'Its a drongo]'
But what was a drongo? I would gaze in the direction that Jane was training
her binoculars, and try to imagine what one looked like. Was it the little
anthill-looking thing off to the left? Or the spiky tree behind the anthill?
Or maybe the little tin shack just behind the spiky tree? I could see
nothing at all.
This inexplicable behaviour began to get on my nerves. It was some time
after we had visited Uncle John's country palm wine bar, but a few minutes
before being held up for sweets and pens at the Jambur primary school, that
I borrowed a pair of binoculars from a fellow tourist and realised what Jane
and Roger were getting so excited about.
It was birds.
Take a pair of binoculars outdoors in The Gambia - anywhere: hotel gardens,
the potholed streets of Serrekunda town, into the peanut fields or mangrove
swamps along the Gambia River - and suddenly what can at times appear to be
a miserably poor and tourist-ridden country is transformed into a series of
vignettes of astonishing wealth and beauty. I arrived in the Gambia knowing
and caring nothing about birds. When I left I was well on the way to
becoming one of that most hopeless of species, the addicted birdwatcher.
The Gambia has had few fair shakes since it became a British slave-trading
entrepot in the 18th century. An historical and geographical aberration, it
is the result of commercial conflict between British and French colonial
trading interests. While France, master of much of north and west Africa,
laid effective claim to the huge territory of Senegal, the British were able
to hang on to the Gambia River, the sluggish, mangrove-bordered waterway
which flows through its heart.
The result, today, is a country which, while some 300 miles long, posesses
land only 15-to-30 miles wide on either side of the river. With no
hinterland, The Gambia's options are few. Ninety per cent of its meagre
wealth comes from peanut exports. Its population is one of the densest,
fastest expanding and poorest in Africa. Tourism is one of its brighter
hopes. Just five hours' flight from London and with six months' guaranteed
sunshine during the northern hemisphere winter, it is an increasingly
popular package destination.
If The Gambia's history and geography have made it a place where North and
South collide, its river has also incited a more gentle kind of meeting. One
of the few waterways to flow through this vast semi-arid region of west
Africa, The Gambia attracts millions of birds every year. Each dry season
hundreds of species, most African, some European migrants, congregate on the
country's riverbanks, beaches, mudflats, forests and grasslands.
Does an annual winter colloquium of birds sound slightly tedious? Perhaps,
in England, it might. But this is no dull, grey-brown meeting of humble
nuthatches and self-effacing finches. This is Africa, and its penchant for
flamboyance, oddity, excess and gaudy allure has been passed on to its
feathered inhabitants. The birds of The Gambia are, quite simply,
outrageous, and make the country one of the premier birdwatching areas in
the world.
One early morning a few days after my south Gambia tour I set out with Lamin
Sidibeh, a Gambian who at 29 is fast building a reputation as a professional
bird guide. He is known far away in England to the BBC - the Bedfordshire
Bird Club - two of whose members I had met walking goggle-eyed about the
lush gardens of the Senegambia Hotel.
Hard-core birdwatchers have a habit of drifting away in mid-sentence, their
eyes suddenly fixed on some object above your left shoulder, but I did
manage to hold them long enough to find out that Lamin is one of the best in
the business.
Among old Africa hands it is common to find that an early interest in big
game watching is replaced by a deep and long-lasting enthusiasm for birds.
There is greater variety, often more technical skill and personal knowledge
needed in spotting them, and a great deal less preparation and money
involved.
To sight a white rhino requires a costly expedition into a game park. To
spot the much smaller but equally spectacular malachite kingfisher - a
brilliant jewel of a creature - you might only have to gaze up at a
telephone line while ambling over to a restaurant for lunch.
Lamin and I, for example, began that morning in a not terribly auspicious
sounding place close to the hotel area, the Kotu sewage ponds. It sounds
ghastly, but there we saw a whole series of delicate waders, birds like the
blackwing stilt that mince around perched on thin pink legs that make up
two-thirds of their height. We saw the cormorant-like African darter drying
its wings after diving, and an English visitor, the grey heron, spearing its
sharp bill into schools of little fish.
From that point on, the morning was an unending succession of discoveries
and surprises. In a spiky, harvested millet field, where peasant women were
collecting stalks to feed their cattle, we came across a Senegal coucal with
green tail, white breast, black head and red wings and eyes, scuttling
through the stubble catching lizards.
In an irrigated rice field we watched a snowy white cattle egret wrestling
with a frog almost too big to get down its narrow throat.
On a mud flat by a small estuary we watched a bar-tailed godwit, a bird with
a beak almost as long as its body, poking around the mangrove roots catching
fiddler crabs for breakfast.
I had passed the Fajara golf club any number of times without thinking much
of it. Its fairways are yellowed, its greens brown. That morning it became
an entrancing place: all you have to do is look up. There we saw a giant
kingfisher, a full 18 inches long from beak to tail, flash by in a brilliant
blue streak. Not far away, in that strangest of African trees, the baobab,
we watched bright green long-tailed parakeets peck at the fruit that is used
to make cream of tartar.
Standing by the hollow of a neem tree - West Africans use its leaves as a
malaria remedy - Lamin whistled a scale of liquid, ascending notes; they
were similarly answered from inside the hollow, and in a minute or two a
pearl-spotted owlet emerged to blink sleepily at us. One of the aerial
wonders we spotted up a tall palm tree was not a bird at all, but a palm
wine tapper doing his morning rounds, shinnying up and down collecting
gourds of sweet fermented sap.
I shall not go on. Suffice it to say that in one morning I saw 55 different
kinds of birds, each new one as exciting and different as the last. I cannot
decide which I like best, but I think I would plump for the tiny
nectar-drinking sunbirds, impossibly bright creatures in yellow, scarlet and
ruby.
I did not quite see the full range, though: there are said to be 507 species
of birds in The Gambia. Even Lamin has seen only 378. But I have not given
up. If, in the future, you come across a wild-eyed twitcher crouched in some
distant palm grove muttering 'Yeesss] It's a drongo]', it might be me.

   Export manager Wong, asked by delegates if the government
consults with industry before levying new taxes, responded: ``Of
course. They come to us to talk and if they are proposing taxes that
are too high, we say you are going to blow up the economy and you
will be kicked out of government.''
   The export zone's more than 500 businesses employ more than
90,000 people.
   This courtship of government and industry began after the 1982
elections, which themselves serve as a guide to Mauritius. Jokes
were made during that election about the economy being as dead as
the Dodo bird, which became extinct after Dutch hunters here wiped
them out several centuries ago.
   An alliance led by the Jugnauth's Mauritian Militant Movement
(MMM) defeated the pro-Western government, taking all 60 elected
seats. But Jugnauth's government immediately began implementing the
suggestions of Western creditors.
   While Jugnauth's government was slashing corporate taxes and
removing duties on many items to entice investors in the export
zone, the island also benefited from an improved world economy,
lower petroleum prices and an absence of cyclones during the sugar
season. But most important was a big influx of money from Hong Kong
and other Asian nations.
   Some of these countries had already reached their export quotas
with Western nations and shifted production to Mauritius.
   Meanwhile, Jugnauth was expelled from the MMM leadership and
forced to form his own party a year after winning the election. His
new party, the Mauritian Socialist Movement, has led an alliance
that has won two subsequent elections.
   Jugnauth's alliance controls two-thirds of the seats in
Parliament, although it won only 9,512 votes more than the
opposition in last year's election in which 89 percent of the
electorate cast ballots.
   In Mauritius terms, this is political stability and both
opposition leader Nababsing, who is with the MMM, and Finance
Minister Lutchmeenaraido credit it with a big role in the country's
economic development.
   ``I don't see any other party changing what we are doing,'' said
Lutchmeenaraido.
   Rather than proposing major changes in the liberal economic
reforms, Nababsing says, it was his party, the former party of the
prime minister, that initiated them.
   Nababsing does criticize the government, saying it has been too
slow to diversify, and that growth is slowing, inflation is out of
control and more attention needs to be paid to avoiding ethnic
divisions.
   Since independence from Britain in 1968, governments have been
careful to avoid fanning ethnic divisions among various groups in
the Hindu majority or other groups.
   Two-thirds of the population are Hindus, many of them descendants
of indentured laborers brought here by the British to work the sugar
planations.
   About 28 percent are Creoles, descendants of Africans and
Europeans or Africans and Asians. About 3 percent are of Chinese
descent and the rest descendants of French or other European stock.
   English is the official language but Creole, a mixture of French
and other languages, along with French are spoken by the vast
majority.
   Road signs are in English but advertisements and newspapers are
in French.
   French and Creole had already been entrenched before the English
captured the island from France in the 19th century. Before the
French, the Dutch occupied the island from 1598 to 1710.

three years before the next earliest-in-the-nation presidential
primary.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who dropped out of the last
Democratic primary before the party convention, plans to speak at
the University of New Hampshire in Durham later this month.
   Gephardt's chief of staff, Richard Sullivan, said the
congressman was going to be in Boston the morning of April 24 and
decided the 60-mile trip to UNH would not be far out of the way.
   Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado is to be commencement speaker May
13 at Keene State College. She also is to attend a get-together
with Sullivan County Democrats in Newport the previous night.
   Last year's Democratic presidential nominee, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, will be in Manchester on May 16 for a party in

Description: Black head and neck, with small reddish-brown forehead shield, 
light bill with dark band near tip. Outer feathers of undertail coverts are 
white, inner ones black. Leg color ranges from greenish-gray in young birds to 
yellow or orangish in adults. In flight, a white trailing edge on most of wing 
is distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Freshwater marshes, wetlands or near lakes and ponds. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Mostly aquatic vegetation and algae; also tadpoles, fish, crustaceans, 
snails, worms, aquatic and terrestrial insects, eggs of other marsh- nesting 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Male paddles after female, flapping wings; female dives if too 
closely pressed. Male paddles with head and neck on water, wingtips raised 
above, spreads and elevates tail to display white patches. Female assumes 
similar pose. . 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Usually over water, in vegetation tall enough to conceal; consists of 
large floating cup of dead stems on platforms anchored to vegetation, lined 
with finer materials. Other platforms for resting and roosting, especially 
brood platform built mostly by male. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Pinkish-buff, marked with blackish-brown. Eggs are around 1.9 inches 
long. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Each year from October to April, Orange County is 
inundated with American coots. Last year, 50 permits to shoot coots were 
issued, mostly to golf courses. Mission Viejo, Woodbridge (Irvine) and many 
other communities with man-made lakes have the same complaint annually about 
these birds. They eat vegetation, destroy grass and defecate widely. 
Considering flocks may number up to 1,500 birds, coots may readily attain pest 
status. 
</P>
<P>
Coots are noisy and aggressively territorial. They select from a repertoire of 
some 14 displays to communicate among themselves. Not only are coots 
demonstrative, they are also hardy. They can adjust quite well to hot 
temperatures. They have lobed feet, which, in addition to their use in battle, 
can effectively conduct heat out of the body. 
</P>
<P>
They are opportunistic feeders. Besides hunting for themselves, coots also feed 
commensally by taking leftovers from other species such as dabbling ducks, or 
pirate plants brought to the surface by diving ducks. Groups of up to five 
juveniles may pirate aquatic vegetation from the bills of ducks and swans. 
</P>
<P>
These birds are the least graceful of all marsh birds. Commonly called 
"splatterers," coots bob their heads while walking, quite likely because the 
head movements help them to judge the distance to their prey.

<TEXT>     Birds that find feeders full of seed or discover crumbs and fruit on a
feeding table will, naturally, come back for more. Still, a backyard feeder is
just one stop in a bird's search for food. Providing food doesn't make birds
totally dependent on human handouts.;   "Feeding birds is more of a benefit to
the people who are doing the feeding," says Ted Chandik, a naturalist and bird
specialist at Palo Alto's Junior Museum.;   About 300 bird species are found
in the Bay Area; the ones most likely to appear in your yard with the least
encouragement are the house finch,; house sparrow, California towhee, white
crowned sparrow, hummingbird,;   the jay and cedar waxwing. The scrub jays
especially like to pig out. Chandik says jays "eat everything and anything."; 
    Black sunflower seed, white proso millet, cracked corn and wheat will
attract nearly all species of seed-eating birds.;   When you put out a simple
hanging birdseed feeder -- either homemade or store-bought -- birds that like
to perch to get their food will stop by for a snack. Sparrows, finches,
towhees, cardinals, chickadees, titmice and nuthatches all get their food this
way.;   Here are other tips on bringing birds into your yard:;   (box)  FOOD
-- Seed and grains are still the birds' favorite food. You can mix your own,
buy packaged seed mixes or merely sit back and let the garden "go to seed."
Your neighbors might hate it, but the birds will love you.;   In their book
"Feed the Birds" (Workman, $8.95), Helen and Dick Witty warn that it's hard to
evaluate packaged wild-bird seed that is widely available at supermarkets, pet
stores and garden centers. "The best mixes," the Wittys write, "will cost more
and will contain more sunflower seed or sunflower meats than any other single
component. This is why you check the label.";   Buy about one month's supply
at a time because the seed and grains can deteriorate if kept longer.;   (box)
 SETTING -- The real estate mantra -- location, location, location -- applies
to bird feeders as well. A good spot for a hanging feeder is four to six feet
above ground level, either on a post or affixed to a tree.;   Birds like to
perch in nearby shrubbery to check out the location or wait in line -- it's
called the pecking order -- for a turn at the food. The natural plantings
should be at a distance of six to eight feet -- close by for cover, but still
far enough away from feeders to protect birds from hidden cats.;   Another
option is a low feeding table. An old picnic table is just about the right
dimensions, but build a small lip around the edge of the table to keep seed
from blowing away.;   The point is to provide several types of feeding
stations in various locations to attract the widest variety of birds.;   (box)
 WATER -- It's irresistible to birds. You can find beautifully made birdbaths
at garden centers, or you can turn over a trash-can lid, fill it with water
and make the birds perfectly happy. The important part is to keep the birdbath
fresh, clean and filled.;   (box)  PLANTINGS -- Birds like a natural
environment. Evergreens are particularly enticing because they offer shelter
and safety.;   But look no further than a cherry tree full of fruit to attract
every bird within five miles. They also like quince, red mulberry, flowering
crab apple and Russian olive for fruit and berries.;   They will also flock to
bayberry, yews, viburnums, dogwood, Tartarian honeysuckle, multiflora rose (or
any that produce small hips), cotoneaster and pyracanthas.;   Pyracantha,
incidentally, is the berry that turns cedar waxwings and robins into
falling-down drunks. In winter after being on the shrub awhile, pyracantha
berries begin fermenting and producing alcohol. Along come the cedar waxwings
and robins to binge on the berries. "They get very, very drunk," Chandik
says.;   (box)   CATS -- Prowling cats are a real danger to birds. Chandik, in
fact, says he stopped feeding birds in his own East Palo Alto yard because his
cat tormented the birds. "There's no foolproof way to protect the birds from
cats," he says.;   The National Audubon Society advises keeping cats indoors
in the morning and evening when birds are feeding. And, attach a bell to the
cat's collar to warn birds.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Santa Clara Valley

<HEAD>Emotions Run High Over Choice of State Bird</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The meadowlark is a ``deserter.'' The magpie
is ``murderous'' and ``thieving.'' So which one should be the state
bird of Montana?
   The question will be taken up by the Montana Legislature this
session, and emotions are running pretty high.
   The present state bird is the meadowlark, but Rep. Tom Hannah
says it deserts the state every winter, just when residents need
cheering up most.
   Enter the magpie, the black-and-white scavenger of the Plains.
   ``He's pretty; he's easily seen along almost any highway in
Montana even at temperatures of up to 40 and 50 below; he is no
fair-weather friend,'' Hannah said recently. ``He is the magpie.''
   But such talk doesn't always sit well with Montanans.
   Stan Howe, a humor columnist for the Great Falls Tribune,
endorsed the magpie as state bird two years ago, prompting a flock
of angry letters.
   Magpies eat the eggs of more desirable birds and peck through the
hides of cows, readers wrote. The most charitable adjectives Tribune
letter-writers found for the magpie were ``murderous'' and
``thieving.''
   Just as things were getting ugly, the Yellowstone Chapter of the
Audubon Society stepped in and _ depending on one's outlook _ either
defended the magpie or defamed the bald eagle.
   ``We know that in some quarters the bird isn't highly thought
of,'' said Gordon Weber of the Audubon Society. However, Hannah
said, people ``just don't realize he's in the same class as the
American eagle. He eats dead things.''
