   Bored policemen shoo monkeys and glance
sleepily at closed-circuit television cameras as they enforce a
curfew in this town whose name has become a battle cry in India's
latest political and religious crisis.
   About 100 people have been killed throughout India in the past
week in riots caused by Hindu plans to build a temple on a dusty
hilltop where a Moslem mosque now stands.
   The latest death was reported today in Lucknow, capital of Uttar
Pradesh state 75 miles west of Ayodhya. Police officials said Hindu
crowds surged through a Moslem neighborhood throwing bricks.
   The religious feud has precipitated a political crisis that has
brought Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government to the brink of
collapse.
   But the firestorm raging elsewhere in the country is masked by
inactivity and tight security in Ayodhya, where Hindu
fundamentalists vow they will get through roadblocks and start
building their temple to the god Rama on Tuesday.
   The fundamentalists said today in a handwritten communique that
thousands of followers were hiding near Ayodhya and were ready to
start building.
   ``Communal tension will flare up all over the country, but an
Ayodhya resident will not let a drop of blood be spilled because
then Rama's name will be sullied,'' said Mudit Sharma, who works
for a Hindu charity near the disputed site.
   ``Moslems of the area are not any diferent from Hindus,''
Sharma said. ``They participate in our festivals. We go to their
house during Islamic festivals. All these fights are because of
political loafers.''
   The fundamentalist cause has been espoused by the Hindu
right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party. Its top leaders are among the
more about 80,000 people arrested in the last week while trying to
march to Ayodhya, 300 miles east of New Delhi.
   The arrests prompted the party to withdraw its support for
Singh's coalition government, leaving him without the parliamentary
majority needed to stay in office.
   Singh, who plans to face Parliament for a vote of confidence on
Nov. 7, wants the temple-mosque dispute settled in court.
   The fundamentalists claim the mosque stands atop the very spot
where Lord Rama was born and therefore is a religious matter, not a
legal one. Moslems, a minority in officially secular but
predominantly Hindu India, fear the displacement of one mosque
could jeopardize hundreds of other Islamic sites across the
country.
   The mosque, called the Babri Masjid, was constructed in the 16th
century when Mogul armies conquered northern India. Hindu
fundamentalists claimed the Moslem conquerors destroyed a Rama
temple on the spot where the mosque now stands.
   The Hindu World Council, backed by the Bharatiya Janata Party,
has organized the campaign to build the temple by either moving or
demolishing the little mosque.
   On Friday, the government of Uttar Pradesh state imposed an
around-the-clock curfew in Ayodhya to keep temple advocates from
reaching the disputed hilltop. Trains to the area were halted and
roads blocked by police and paramilitary troops.
   ``They have made Ayodhya into a cantonment for political gains.
Let them arrest us, but thousands of devotees will come to Ayodhya
tomorrow,'' said Tara Kant Jha, secretary of the World Hindu
Council's local office in Ayodhya.
   The council and the Bharatiya Janata Party claim the
government's tough stand on Ayodhya is only a bid to win Moslem
votes.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people, of
whom 82 percent are Hindu. In Uttar Pradesh state, where the
government is allied with Singh, Moslems account for about 30
percent of the 120 million people.
   Hindu-Moslem clashes occur periodically in other parts of Uttar
Pradesh, but no one can remember trouble around Ayodhya or its twin
town of Faizabad, three miles down the road. About a quarter of the
area's population is Moslem.
   ``There never has been any communal tension in Faizabad or
Ayodhya. And I don't think there will be after Oct. 30,'' the date
deemed auspicious by Hindu astrologers to start building the Rama
temple, said District Commissioner Madhukar Gupta, the top civil
administrator of the area.
   Most residents agree. They seem unconcerned about the curfew,
but business is suffering.
   Ayodhya is a major Hindu pilgrimage site. There are about 6,000
temples in the town of 45,000 people on the banks of the River
Saryu.
   Most people live on the business generated by tens of thousands
of Hindu pilgrims who arrive every year in October for a Hindu
festival.
   About 20,000 security troops deployed around Ayodhya have
prevented pilgrims from entering Ayodhya this week, fearing Hindu
activists may infiltrate the town.
   Elaborate security arrangements include closed-circuit
television cameras and iron gates every 20 yards on the lane
leading to the disputed hilltop.

<HEAD>Defection Of Hindu Fundamentalist Party Threatens Singh Government</HEAD>

   A right-wing Hindu party withdrew its
support for Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government today,
threatening to bring down the fragile coalition that has governed
India for the past 10 months.
   Singh refused to resign and said he would take the battle to
floor of Parliament, where his centrist National Front government
had relied on the votes of the Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya
Janata Party to survive.
   The crisis was precipitated by the arrest earlier Tuesday of
Bharatiya Janata's president, Lal Krishna Advani, as he led a
cross-country march to muster support for building a new Hindu
temple on the site of a 16th century Moslem mosque.
   About six hours later, party leaders submitted a letter to
Indian President Ramaswamy Venkataraman withdrawing support for
Singh's National Front government.
   The prime minister told reporters at the presidential palace
that the loss of Bharatiya Janata support ``doesn't mean that all
support is gone.'' However, it was unclear how he could avoid
calling new elections.
   With the defection of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Singh's
centrist government loses the fragile majority it cobbled together
from across the political spectrum after November general
elections.
   No single party had won enough seats to take power unilaterally.
   The next steps are up to Singh and the president.
   Under the constitution, the options include Singh's resignation
as prime minister and elections for a new Parliament.
   President Venkataraman could also ask Singh to try to muster a
new majority in Parliament, which appears mathematically and
politically improbable.
   Or, the president can turn to the opposition leader, former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and ask if Gandhi's Congress Party
could form a coalition government.
   That also appears unlikely.
   The crisis was precipitated by Advani's determination to go
ahead with his march to bolster support for the campaign to replace
a Moslem mosque with a temple to the Hindu god Lord Rama.
   Singh had urged Hindu fundamentalists to postpone the temple
plan. At least 80 people died this month in Hindu-Moslem clashes
spurred by the dispute.
   In a nationally televised address Monday night, Singh renewed
his appeal and said he was prepared to face the fact that his stand
could bring down the government.
   ``Religious fanaticism is the first step towards the foundation
for a theocratic state,'' Singh said in his 20-minute TV speech.
``It will be the death of India as a secular state.''
   The prime minister added: ``Hundreds of governments can come and
go, but the nation should remain one.''
   Advani was arrested about sunrise in a remote part of Bihar
state near the village of Samastipur, about 450 miles southeast of
New Delhi.
   He had been leading a caravan of supporters across the Hindu
heartland to demonstrate and bolster support for plans to build a
temple on a site now occupied by a 16th century mosque in the holy
Hindu town of Ayodhya. Ayodhya is in Uttar Pradesh state, which
lies between New Delhi and Bihar state.
   Advani's planned path through Bihar and Uttar Pradesh en route
to Ayodhya would have taken him through poor villages populated by
both Moslems and Hindus. In Bihar especially, these villages have
been recurring flashpoints for Hindu-Moslem violence.
   Hindu fundamentalists have vowed to start building the temple in
one week on the spot where they say the Hindu god Lord Rama was
born. Moslem activists and religious leaders have vowed to prevent
any encroachment on the mosque.
   The outcry has torn at the social and political fabric of
officially secular India, where 82 percent of the 880 million
people are Hindus. Moslems form 12 percent of the population.
   Singh took office in December after ousting Gandhi and his
Congress Party in the November general election. Although the
Congress Party and its allies hold 210 of Parliament's 522 seats,
it lacked the majority to govern.
   Singh's National Front coalition holds just 141 seats, but it
won the tacit support of the two extremes of India's political
spectrum: Advani's right-wing Hindu party and the Left Front
alliance of several communist parties.
   With that support, Singh could draw on enough votes to give him
the majority needed to pass legislation and stay in power.
   Bharatiya Janata has 88 members of Parliament, the Left Front
51.

<TEXT>
   Fundamentalist Hindus decided Friday to
postpone building a temple at a disputed religious site claimed by
both Moslems and Hindus.
   Avaidyanath, a Hindu priest who uses one name, told reporters
the World Hindu Conference decided to postpone construction of the
temple for at least four months so the government can find a
solution to the long-running dispute.
   Construction was to have started Feb. 14 on land that also
contains a 16th century mosque.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh said building the shrine would inflame
religious passions and lead to widespread violence, and he urged
Hindus to call off construction.
   ``We have decided to accept the prime minister's appeal,'' said
Avaidyanath, who wore the saffron robes of a Hindu ascetic. ``We'll
give him four months to solve the issue.''
   Last year, at least 300 people died in violence sparked by the
Hindu group's decision to build the temple and raze the mosque. The
foundation stone for the shrine was laid Nov. 9, but construction
was postponed because of the dispute.
   Hindus claim the site is the birthplace of the Rama, an
incarnation of Vishnu, one of the most important Hindu gods. They
say the Babri Masjid, or the mosque named after Moghal emperor
Babar, was built over Rama's birthplace.
   Moslems say it is difficult to say where Rama was born and they
will not accept destruction of their mosque.
   The issue has become a flashpoint for tensions between India's
majority Hindus, who make up 82 percent of its 880 million people,
and its Moslems, who form the country's largest minority but still
comprise only 12 percent of the population.
   The dispute became a major issue in last November's general
elections, and analysts say it was one of the causes of the
downfall of the previous prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi.
   Singh, his successor, has not come up with any specfic plan to
solve the problem but has promised to set up a government committee
to meet Hindu and Moslem representatves and try to come up with a
solution.
   ``The problem has been hanging for 450 years,'' said Ashok
Singhal, general secretary of the World Hindu Conference. ``Four
months more will not matter.''

   Thousands of Hindu holy men and their
followers broke through police barricades Tuesday and stormed
toward the Moslem mosque they want to replace with a Hindu temple.
   Many were beaten back by police who fired tear gas and lashed
out with iron-tipped bamboo canes. Dozens were injured. Hindu holy
men screamed obscenities from rooftops and pelted the police with
stones.
   About 200 people overran police lines in the narrow lanes and
were halted at the foot of the hill just 600 feet from the mosque.
   The religious dispute has made the name of this Hindu holy town
a battle cry in Moslem-Hindu riots that have left more than 100
dead across India in the past week.
   The dispute threatens to topple the government of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh. A right-wing Hindu party withdrew its support for Singh
last week when his government tried to deter plans to build new
Hindu temple where the mosque now stands.
   Ayodhya had been under around-the-clock curfew since Friday in
an effort to keep Hindu fundamentalists from carrying out their vow
to begin construction of the temple Tuesday.
   Roads leading to the 16th century mosque were blocked, but about
5,000 people emerged from hiding places in fields around Ayodhya
before sunrise and stormed a bridge leading into the town.
   Police arrested between 100 and 200 people and rained blows with
their bamboo canes on fallen members of the crowd. The 600
policemen on the mile-long bridge eventually turned back the crowd.
   Inside Ayodhya, a town of about 40,000 people, reporters saw
some members of the state police force lift barricades and let
Hindu holy men run into the lanes leading to the mosque. The
infiltrators were halted short of the mosque by federal
paramilitary police.
   On Monday, a group of about 80 Hindu holy men in Ayodhya threw
stones at police and set a bus on fire when authorities attempted
to arrest a local Hindu priest, a police inspector said.
   The inspector, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was
an isolated incident and did not cause any lasting tension.
   But within an hour of the skirmish, authorities banned entry
into Ayodhya and canceled passes issued to reporters.
   Despite the efforts to deter them and the presence of 20,000
police and paramilitary troops in town, the Hindu fundamentalists
vowed to start the temple construction program as scheduled.
   In New Delhi on Monday, the World Hindu Council had claimed
10,000 supporters had slipped through police cordons and roadblocks
around Ayodhya.
   The exact time for the start of construction has not been
announced.
   In New Delhi, Prime Minister Singh offered to resign if the
Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which supports the
temple construction program, would accept a legal verdict on the
dispute.
   Singh's National Front coalition was relegated to a minority in
Parliament last week after Bharatiya Janata withdrew its support to
the government. Singh has maintained he still holds a parliamentary
majority and is scheduled to seek a vote of confidence on Nov. 7.
   The government has vowed to block the temple construction and
said a court of law should decide who the site belongs to.
   The fundamentalists claim the mosque stands atop the very spot
where Rama, one of the most worshipped Hindu gods, was born and
therefore is a religious matter, not a legal one.
   Moslems, a minority in officially secular but predominantly
Hindu India, fear the displacement of one mosque could jeopardize
hundreds of other Islamic sites across the country.
   On Friday the government of Uttar Pradesh state imposed an
around-the-clock curfew in Ayodhya in an effort to keep temple
advocates from reaching the disputed hilltop. Trains to the area
were halted and roads blocked by police and paramilitary troops.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people, of
whom 82 percent are Hindu. In Uttar Pradesh state, where the
government is allied with Singh, Moslems account for about 30
percent of the 120 million people.

   Troops opened fire today on Hindu
fundamentalists who broke through police lines and surged toward a
holy site claimed by both Hindus and Moslems. At least five people
were killed and 20 wounded.
   Thirteen more people died in Hindu-Moslem clashes in several
cities hundreds of miles away, police said. At least 125 people
have been killed in riots across India this past week, most in
clashes between Hindus and Moslems.
   The dispute threatens to topple the government of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh, who opposes the Hindu campaign to replace a
16th-century Moslem mosque.
   Militant members of the country's Hindu majority had said they
would begin tearing down the mosque today and replacing it with a
temple.
   Singh today repeated his offer to resign if members of his party
in Parliament ``feel that change of leadership will serve larger
goals.'' He made a similar offer Monday.
   About 200 Hindus eventually reached the site today in Ayodhya.
Those who got through planted Hindu religious flags on the mosque
in victory before police drove them away.
   About 10,000 people who had surged past police barricades
surrounded the perimeter of the disputed site when three Hindu holy
men urged them to halt the violence, saying they had negotiated a
peaceful sttlement with local officials. But part of the crowd
apparently did not hear the appeal and pushed toward the mosque,
setting fire to six police jeeps along the way.
   Police then opened fire. The federal government later announced
that five people were killed. About 20 others were injured by the
gunfire, witnesses said.
   Hindu holy men screamed obscenities from rooftops and pelted the
police with stones. At least four officers were injured.
   Many of the militant Hindus were beaten back by police, who
fired tear gas and lashed out with iron-tipped bamboo canes. Dozens
were injured.
   The crowd initially halted about 100 yards from the mosque,
where police and paramilitary troops stood with rifles ready. But
later about 200 Hindus broke through police lines and reached the
small, one-story mosque.
   Young men wearing orange headbands, the color of the Hindu
faith, climbed atop the mosque and chipped concrete from each of
its three domes, claiming this was a ``symbolic destruction'' of
the Islamic shrine.
   They planted a saffron flag atop each dome before police drove
them away. Jubilant crowds poured through the streets, shouting
``Victory to mother India!''
   In New Delhi, the government's chief spokesman, Ramamohan Rao,
said there was no damage to the mosque.
   The World Hindu Council, which is leading the temple program,
said it would go ahead with its construction effort.
   ``We will only rest when the temple in complete,'' Girilal
Kishore, a Hindu holy man and senior official of the council told
reporters in New Delhi.
   Ayodha, a city of 40,000 people, had been under a
round-the-clock curfew since Friday and roads leading to the mosque
were blocked as authorities tried to halt any attempt to tear down
the mosque.
   But people emerged from hiding places in fields around Ayodhya
before sunrise and stormed a bridge leading into the town.
   About 20,000 police and paramilitary troops were deployed in and
around Ayodhya, 300 miles southeast of New Delhi. They were among
200,000 security troops on alert throughout Uttar Pradesh state.
   About 80,000 people have been arrested in the last week in the
rural state. Most were made under preventive detention laws that
allow authorities to hold people without charge when they believe
public safety is threatened.
   The detainees included top leaders of the right-wing Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party. It has withdrawn its support for Prime
Minister Singh in Parliament, plunging India into political crisis.
   Singh now does not have a reliable vote bank in Parliament to
preserve his minority government, which took office last December.
   The mosque at issue was built on the place that many Hindu
leaders claim is the very spot where the god Rama was born.
   Moslems, who make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people,
fear that if one mosque is moved or destroyed, hundreds of other
Islamic shrines across India would be in peril.
   Athough India is constitutionally a secular nation, Hindus
comprise 82 percent of the population and have always held the
prime minister's post.

   One holy man walked naked among his
disciples, offering sacred ash, blessings and cardamoms as
consecrated host. Not far away, another holy man delivered a sermon
while dressed in a saffron robe.
   ``Why move naked?'' the second said. ``You can reach God
dressed.''
   A third, who pitched his tent nearby, told his group: ``Dress
does not matter. Ways do not matter. ... Be pure, be good and you
will reach heaven. You need no guru.''
   They were Hindu holy men at the Hinduism's biggest congregation,
the ``Kumbh Mela,'' which began here recently in Allahabad.
   The three holy men, each with different views, were examples of
the diversity of a religion believed to have been practiced since
the third millennium B.C.
   They also showed that Hinduism, with 330 million gods and
goddesses, can be confusing even to Hindus.
   The religion claims a following of 730 million people in India
and Nepal and parts of Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand in Southeast
Asia; Mauritius, in Africa and Fiji in the South Pacific. For
comparison, the Roman Catholic Church claims a following of 850
million.
   An estimated 500,000 holy men and their followers started camping
at Allahabad on Jan. 14, for a seven-week congregation, or fair,
during which 30 million to 40 million pilgrims were expected to take
dips at the ``Sangam,'' the confluence of the three rivers most
sacred to Hindus _ the Ganges, the Jamuna and the Saraswathi.
   The ``Sangam,'' which takes it's name from a mythical fight
between gods and demons over a pot of nectar, is held every 12 years
when Jupiter enters Taurus and the Sun and the Moon are in Capricorn.
   ``You can't explain Hinduism,'' said M.P. Asthana, who has
attended four earlier fairs. ``It is a way of life, where karmas
(the results of deeds) are most important. Even to an average Hindu,
the faith is so confusing.''
   He added: ``No one can explain how we got to acquire and where
are our 330 million gods and goddesses.''
   Believers worship images and statues of gods and goddesses as
well as live animals, including rats. In Hinduism every god has his
steed, or vehicle, and the rat is the vehicle of Ganesha on whom the
elephant-headed, master-of-ceremony god rides.
   Hinduism postulates that everyone goes through a series of
rebirths, or reincarnations, that eventually lead to Moksha, the
spiritual salvation that frees one from the cycle of rebirths.
   ``With each rebirth you can move closer to or further from
eventual moksha,'' said Asthana, who is the spokesman for the state
government of Uttar Pradesh, in which Allahabad is a major city.
   ``The deciding factor is one's karma. Bad actions result in bad
karma, which leads one to lower incarnation and a step further from
salvation.
   ``But if one's actions have been good he or she will reincarnate
on a higher level and be a step closer to eventual freedom from
rebirth.''
   Coming to Allahabad has special significance for Hindus and tens
of thousands come daily to take holy dips at the Sangam, believing
doing this during the auspicious planetary conjugation will wash
away all the sins of a lifetime and release them from the cycle of
births and rebirths.
   ``It is like appearing directly before God for confessions,''
said Jagannath Dwevedi, the chief adminstrator of the fair.
   ``No one knows how bathing will wash off sins, but the belief is
so great that no logic stands.''
   Before taking the dip, pilgrims offer milk and marigolds to the
rivers in a purification ritual and later throw water with their
hands toward the sky, believing that some drops will reach their
ancestors in the heaven.
   ``Now, this sounds like a total nonsense, but people do it,''
said the 56-year-old Dwevedi. ``It is the age-old belief. It is
above logic.''
   Nagas are the naked recluses of Hinduism and they have their own
logic.
   ``Nakedness ends all dichotomy in human life,'' said one,
refusing to give his name. ``We were born naked and therefore should
remain naked and die naked.''
   Fifty-two different religious groups put up sprawling tent homes
at the fair. Each has its own way to reach God. Most of them
constantly smoke marijuana. They say it helps them meditate and
become closer to God.
   ``This makes Hinduism unique,'' said Asthana. ``There is no
restriction on how you reach your goal _ salvation.''
   Only vegetables appear on the fair's menus because devout Hindus
are vegetarians and eating beef is taboo. Hindus worship the cow.

and Nepal and parts of Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand in Southeast
Asia; Mauritius, in Africa and Fiji in the South Pacific. For
comparison, the Roman Catholic Church claims a following of 850
million.
   An estimated 500,000 holy men and their followers started camping
at Allahabad on Jan. 14, for a seven-week congregation, or fair,
during which 30 million to 40 million pilgrims were expected to take
dips at the ``Sangam,'' the confluence of the three rivers most
sacred to Hindus _ the Ganges, the Jamuna and the Saraswathi.
   The ``Sangam,'' which takes it's name from a mythical fight
between gods and demons over a pot of nectar, is held every 12 years
when Jupiter enters Taurus and the Sun and the Moon are in Capricorn.
   ``You can't explain Hinduism,'' said M.P. Asthana, who has
attended four earlier fairs. ``It is a way of life, where karmas
(the results of deeds) are most important. Even to an average Hindu,
the faith is so confusing.''
   He added: ``No one can explain how we got to acquire and where
are our 330 million gods and goddesses.''
   Believers worship images and statues of gods and goddesses as
well as live animals, including rats. In Hinduism every god has his
steed, or vehicle, and the rat is the vehicle of Ganesha on whom the
elephant-headed, master-of-ceremony god rides.
   Hinduism postulates that everyone goes through a series of
rebirths, or reincarnations, that eventually lead to Moksha, the
spiritual salvation that frees one from the cycle of rebirths.
   ``With each rebirth you can move closer to or further from
eventual moksha,'' said Asthana, who is the spokesman for the state
government of Uttar Pradesh, in which Allahabad is a major city.
   ``The deciding factor is one's karma. Bad actions result in bad
karma, which leads one to lower incarnation and a step further from
salvation.
   ``But if one's actions have been good he or she will reincarnate
on a higher level and be a step closer to eventual freedom from
rebirth.''
   Coming to Allahabad has special significance for Hindus and tens
of thousands come daily to take holy dips at the Sangam, believing
doing this during the auspicious planetary conjugation will wash
away all the sins of a lifetime and release them from the cycle of
births and rebirths.
   ``It is like appearing directly before God for confessions,''
said Jagannath Dwevedi, the chief adminstrator of the fair.
   ``No one knows how bathing will wash off sins, but the belief is
so great that no logic stands.''
   Before taking the dip, pilgrims offer milk and marigolds to the
rivers in a purification ritual and later throw water with their
hands toward the sky, believing that some drops will reach their
ancestors in the heaven.
   ``Now, this sounds like a total nonsense, but people do it,''
said the 56-year-old Dwevedi. ``It is the age-old belief. It is
above logic.''
   Nagas are the naked recluses of Hinduism and they have their own
logic.
   ``Nakedness ends all dichotomy in human life,'' said one,
refusing to give his name. ``We were born naked and therefore should
remain naked and die naked.''
   Fifty-two different religious groups put up sprawling tent homes
at the fair. Each has its own way to reach God. Most of them
constantly smoke marijuana. They say it helps them meditate and
become closer to God.
   ``This makes Hinduism unique,'' said Asthana. ``There is no
restriction on how you reach your goal _ salvation.''
   Only vegetables appear on the fair's menus because devout Hindus
are vegetarians and eating beef is taboo. Hindus worship the cow.

<UNK>Magistrate Blocks Hindu Construction at Site Claimed by Moslems</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A district magistrate on Sunday blocked
construction of a Hindu temple that has ignited violent protests by
Moslems who claim the project infringes on their holy land, a news
agency said.
   Press Trust of India said the fundamentalist Hindu group trying
to build the temple at Ayodhya, 325 miles southeast of New Delhi,
had agred to delay construction pending discussions at a religious
convocation in January.
   At least 300 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem riots in
India since mid-August, when the World Conference of Hindus vowed
to build the temple on a site occupied by a 16th century mosque.
   The foundation of the new temple was placed Friday about 120
feet in front of the Babri Masjid mosque, whose name honors Babar,
one of the Mogul conquerors who introduced Islam to India.
   The ceremony touched off attacks on Hindu temples and shops
Saturday in two neighboring Moslem nations: Bangladesh and
Pakistan, which were part of India before 1947 when the former
British-ruled subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines
into independent nations.
   More protests erupted Sunday. In Lahore, Pakistan, hundreds of
Pakistanis lined a major street, chanting slogans and rattling
placards in opposition to the temple.
   Moslems and Hindus both claim the temple site is sacred to their
religion. Hindus say the mosque was built atop an ancient Hindu
temple marking the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of the most popular
gods in the Hindu pantheon.
   The area's district magistrate, R.S. Srivastava, was quoted
Sunday by Press Trust of India as saying he could not give the
Hindus permission to continue digging at the site as long as the
matter was pending in court.
   Press Trust said the Hindu group building the temple, Vishwa
Hindu Parishad, had agreed to halt work temporarily.
   It quoted the group's general secretary, Ashok Singhal, as
saying a decision on the next course of action would be made during
a Hindu conference in Allahabad on Jan. 27.
   Singhal said last week his group would not try to demolish the
mosque but wanted to remove it ``intact and honorably'' from the
site.
   Moslems say this would set a bad precedent, since they say there
are at least 316 other mosques in India that Hindus claim are built
on Hindu holy places.
   Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Saturday denounced
the planned temple as ``a willful desecration of an Islamic holy
place.'' An Indian foreign ministry spokesman promptly accused her
of ``malicious meddling'' in India's internal affairs.
   Saudi Arabia and Iran also have criticized the Indian government.
   The dispute has become a chief issue in Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's re-election campaign. On Saturday. India's most
influential Islamic clergyman, Syed Abdullah Bukhari, urged Moslems
to vote Gandhi and his Congress Party out of office.
   India has more Moslems than any other country in the world
except Indonesia, even though Indian Moslems form only 11 percent
of the population of 880 million. They traditionally have voted for
the Congress Party, so their alienation could prove crucial in the
elections on Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   India has had a secular government but it has always been headed
by Hindus who make up 82 percent of the population.

   With a superficial scratching of earth and
placement of four bricks, Hindu fundamentalists Thursday reaffirmed
their intention to build a temple that has stirred a religious and
political storm.
   Outnumbered by police and paramilitary troops surrounding the
site, about 2,000 Hindu holy men, politicians, worshipers and
youthful, unarmed guards mobbed a patch of earth considered sacred
by Hindus and Moslems.
   Tens of thousands of other Hindu faithfuls streamed by behind
the ceremony site outside a police barricade. Hindus planned a
formal start to dig the foundation on Friday.
   At least 290 people have died in Hindu-Moslem clashes since
August when Hindu fundamentalists announced they would build a new
temple to the god Ram on the site of an existing 17th century
mosque.
   The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which is behind the temple program,
maintains the mosque was built atop an ancient Hindu temple marking
the spot where the group says Ram was born 900,000 years ago.
   Most of the deaths occurred late last month in Bihar state, next
to Ayodhya's Uttar Pradesh state, as bricks for the temple were
borne by Hindu processions to this dusty town on the Saryu River.
   There have been no reports of deaths in Ayodhya, and there was
no sign of violence in the town of 35,000 on Thursday. The Ayodhya
case has become a major campaign issue for Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi as he seeks to return his Congress Party to power in
elections that will be conducted Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   But neither he nor the man trying to replace him, Vishwanath
Pratap Singh of the National Front coalition, has offered a
solution. They are fearful of alienating the vote of Hindus, who
make up 82 percent of India's 880 milliion people, although Hindus
traditionally have voted for secular parties. The candidates also
want the Moslem vote, which usually has gone heavily to the
Congress Party.
   Singh had planned to visit Ayodhya on Thursday to cool religious
tensions, but changed his plans and made a short stop in Faizabad,
about four miles away.
   In Faizabad, Singh said the Hindu-Moslem dispute over the
Ayodhya site ``cannot be decided by the courts.'' He declined to
say how it should be decided.
   The question of proprietorship at Ayodhya has been dragging
through the courts for four decades.
   So far the only thing legally clear is that the initial
foundation for the new temple is slated for a 25-foot-by-23-foot
plot owned by a Hindu. This tiny plot could hold little more than
the front steps of the proposed temple.
   The rest of the envisoned two-story, three-domed structure would
engulf land whose ownership is under dispute, including the 17th
century mosque.
   ``We will not break down this structure,'' said Ashok Singhal,
referring to the the building Moslems call the Babri Masjid, or
Mosque of Babar. Hindus call it the Ram Janambhoomi, or Ram's
birthplace.
   ``It can be lifted _ honorably lifted _ and moved, so this
mosque, if it is a mosque, is not destroyed,'' said Singhal, a
senior trustee of the committee to build the new Hindu temple.
   Singhal said he hoped to make such an attempt and begin
contruction within a month, leaving the impression that it would be
deferred until after a new government is chosen.

   Religious riots sparked by Hindu
fundamentalists' attempt to seize a Moslem mosque intensified
Thursday, and the death toll in nine days of clashes rose to more
than 200.
   News agencies and officials reported at least 31 people died
across the country on Thursday. They were killed in battles between
Hindus and Moslems or when police fired on mobs or when victims
died in hospitals of injuries suffered in earlier riots.
   At least 210 people have died since Oct. 24, when the fighting
began.
   Most of the deaths were in Uttar Pradesh, the state where the
disputed shrine is located, and in Gujarat state. Both states have
a history of sectarian clashes and simmering tensions between
Hindus and Moslems.
   Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state. At least 30
percent of its 120 million people are Moslems. Violence has erupted
in 22 of its 63 districts, according to police officials in
Lucknow, the state capital.
   The disput has also caused riots in neighboring Bangladesh, an
Islamic nation, where Moslem mobs attacked temples and Hindu shops
and homes after hearing of the violence in India.
   At least one person was killed in Dhaka, which is under curfew
along with the port city of Chittagong.
   In Ayodhya, site of the disputed mosque, the bodies of three
Hindus were found Thursday in the Saryu River.
   The victims were apparently killed Tuesday when police opened
fire to throw back Hindus who stormed the mosque, residents said.
At least seven people are previously known to have died in the
police action.
   The discovery of the bodies led to the deployment of extra
government troops around the dusty temple town and forced Hindu
groups to postpone a fresh attempt to storm the mosque.
   But members of the fundamentalist World Hindu Council vowed to
continue their efforts to take over the disputed site. Ashok
Singhal, the council's general secretary, told a public meeting
outside Ayodhya his group would not give up its campaign to replace
the mosque with a temple.
   Singhal is wanted by the police. His appearance at a
well-publicized meeting attended by thousands of people lent
credence to reports that many police officers are sympathetic to
the Hindu movement.
   ``There is no power on earth which can stop us from building the
temple,'' Singhal told the crowd. ``There is no place for Islam in
our nation.''
   Singhal, who wore a bandage around his head, sustained injuries
during Tuesday's attack on the temple. He later slipped away from
the hospital where he was treated.
   The World Hindu Council says the 460-year-old Babri mosque is
built over the birthplace of Lord Rama, one of the most revered
Hindu gods.
   At least 900 people were killed in Hindu-Moslem violence last
year when the group first announced its intention to take over the
site by force.
   The dispute has threatened to bring down Prime Minister V.P.
Singh's 11-month-old government. A pro-Hindu party, which had
supported the government coalition, withdrew its backing two weeks
ago when its president was arrested while leading a march to drum
up support for the temple construction.
   In another political development Thursday, the Congress Party of
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi supported the government of
Chimanbhai Patel, a member of Singh's National Front coalition, in
a vote of confidence in the Gujarat state assembly.
   Patel's government had been reduced to a minority after the
Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support in line
with its decision to jettison the National Front coalition in the
federal Parliament.
   Congress Party leaders in New Delhi defended the decision by
saying they were willing to support the National Front - but not
Singh. They have said the party will oppose Singh in the Nov. 7
confidence vote - but could support a National Front government if
Singh were replaced as prime minister.
   Political commentators and newspapers have attacked Singh for
what they call his vacillation on the temple-mosque dispute, saying
it is the greatest threat to India's political system since the
country became independent in 1947.
   India is predominantly Hindu and all its prime ministers have
belonged to the majority community, but tolerance of all religions
and secularism is a part of its constitution.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people and
Moslems comprise 12 percent of the population. The others include
Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists.

   Violence between Hindus and Moslems broke
out in southern India Friday and at least 16 people were killed in
stabbings, news reports said. Four others were killed elsewhere in
the nation.
   Authorities clamped an indefinite curfew on the southern town,
Hyderabad, confining people to their homes. Press Trust of India
said the violence started in the morning and continued throughout
the day despite the curfew.
   Fighting between followers of the two faiths also erupted in
northern Aligarh, where at least three people were killed and 12
injured, Press Trust reported. A curfew was also imposed in
Aligarh, it said.
   And in Ayodhya, the flashpoint of a lingering dispute between
the religious groups, a Moslem man was burned to death after Hindu
fundamentalists accused him of trying to disrupt their campaign to
replace a mosque with a temple.
   The identities of victims were not given. Indian news media do
not identify the victims or perpetrators of sectarian violence for
fear it might exacerbate tensions.
   At least 380 people have died in Hindu-Moslem violence in the
last two months since Hindu fundamentalists announced plans to pull
down a disputed mosque in Ayodhya and replace it with a temple.
   At least 22 people were killed when police opened fire on Hindu
militants attempting to storm the mosque on Oct. 30 and again on
Nov. 2.
   On Thursday, the militants resumed their campaign to storm the
temple. But they did not resist when police blocked them from
reaching the disputed shrine, apparently because of an
understanding the event would be more symbolic than real.
   The religious crisis ignited by the Hindu campaign brought down
the government of former Prime Minister V.P. Singh last month.
   Singh's coalition lost its parliamentary majority after a Hindu
fundamentalist party withdrew support over the prime minister's
Ayodhya policy.
   Singh was replaced Nov. 10 by Chandra Shekhar, who has said he
will attempt to defuse the issue by holding talks with Moslem and
Hindu leaders. The talks began in New Delhi earlier this week but
have made no real progress.
   The dispute over the mosque has lingered for more than 100
years. Hindus say Moslem invaders built the small mosque atop a
temple marking the birthplace of Rama, a Hindu god. Moslems say it
is impossible to say where Rama was born.
   Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people.
Moslems make up 12 percent.

   Hindus and Moslems clashed in a central
city Saturday, and news reports said at least seven people died,
including four passengers dragged from a train by a mob.
   The clashes in Aligarh, 80 miles southeast of New Delhi, forced
the city adminstration to call for army reinforcements and impose
an indefinite curfew, United News of India said.
   Fighting also broke out in the southern city of Hyderabad, and
UNI said one person was slain.
   At least 380 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem violence in
the last two months after Hindu fundamentalists announced plans to
take over a mosque and replace it with a temple.
   The deaths in Aligarh brought the total number of people killed
in sectarian violence in the city since Friday to at least 16,
Press Trust of India and UNI said.
   The news agencies did not name the victims. Indian media
prohibit identification of victims or the perpetrators of sectarian
violence for fear that it will exacerbate further tensions.
   UNI said the city adminstration called the army to help the
police and imposed an indefinite curfew restricting people to their
homes. It was not immediately known what caused the clashes.
   Among the victims were four passengers of a train who were
dragged out and killed by a mob, UNI said.
   In the Hindu temple town of Ayodhya, the flashpoint of a
lingering dispute between India's Hindu majority and Moslem
minority, at least 1,200 Hindu fundamentalists allowed themselves
to be arrested on Saturday as part of a campaign to replace the
disputed mosque with a temple.
   ``Courting'' arrest is a traditional form of protest in India.
Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people are detained for few hours
and then released without charges.
   The religious crisis ignited by the Hindu campaign also
triggered the downfall of previous Prime Minister V.P. Singh's

<HEAD>Procession to Support Building of Temple Reaches Delhi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A procession of Hindu conservatives
arrived in the capital Sunday on a 6,000-mile pilgrimage to promote
the building of a temple on a site claimed by Moslems and now
occupied by a mosque.
   Tens of thousands of supporters cheered the two-mile-long
procession as it reached the capital 20 days after setting out from
the western city of Somnath.
   The procession was led by Lal Krishna Advani, leader of the
Indian People's Party, who rode in a Toyota pick-up converted to
look like a chariot used in festivals to carry Hindu idols.
   The pilgrimage was on a roundabout route to the holy town of
Ayodhya, 300 miles southeast of New Delhi and home to the disputed
site. Hindus revere Ayodhya as the birthplace of Lord Rama, an
important Hindu god.
   Hindu fundamentalists want to tear down the mosque they claim
replaced a temple destroyed in the 16th century by Moghul
conquerers. Moslem leaders dispute the claim and refuse to vacate
the site. Neither side will compromise.
   ``Never in the 40 years of my political life have I seen such
vast popular support for an issue,'' Advani told Press Trust of
India.
   News agencies said police put dozens of Advani's supporters
under preventative detention in towns along the route, apparently
fearing Moslem-Hindu clashes.
   Earlier, police used truncheons to clear a path for the
procession through a crowd of 200 people protesting a new
government policy that would reserve half of federal jobs for
lower-caste Hindus, suppressed for centuries.
   There are 17 million unemployed educated youths, many of them
from the upper castes. The new policy, over which more than 60
students have committed suicide, has overshadowed the deeper
problem between the two religious communities.
   While Advani prepared for a rally, expected to draw more than
100,000 supporters, People's Party activists drove through the city
on trucks garlanded with marigolds, blaring a message that ``the
temple will be built.''
   The dispute is also laced with politics, piting not only Hindus
against Moslems, but Prime Minister V.P. Singh against Advani's
People's Party, which provides crucial support to keep the minority
government in power.
   The fundamentalists say they will tear down the mosque and begin
building the new Ram temple on Oct. 30, with or without permission.
The Uttar Pradesh local government has said it will not allow
Advani's procession into the state.
   Singh has urged restraint until a court rules on petitions
submitted by both sides. Advani has said, however, it was not a
matter for the courts to settle.
   Advani has said the People's Party will decide in November
whether it will continue to support Singh's coalition, implying the
temple issue may determine its stand. A withdrawal of support could
lead to an election next year.
   Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people.
   Critics say mounting tensions fueled by the procession through
eight Indian states were responsible for two outbursts of violence
between Hindus and Moslems over the last two weeks in which at
least 80 people died.

<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested about 1,000 Moslems
today when they tried to march to the nearby town of Ayodhya, where
triumphal Hindus celebrated the building of a new temple on a site
claimed by both religions.
   The Moslem protest was peaceful, but one of its leaders who was
arrested, Zafaryab Jilani, warned: ``When all these methods fail,
arms are taken up. The next generation may not listen to peaceful
protest.''
   At least 290 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem violence in
three Indian states since August, when plans for the new temple
were announced. So far the violence has not spread to Ayodhya and
Faizabad, 330 miles southeast of the capital New Delhi.
   The demonstrators in Faizabad accused Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi and his Congress Party of caving in to Hindu fundamentalists
in a bid for votes from the Hindu majority in national elections
less than two weeks away.
   ``If this ruling Congress Party is ousted from power, perhaps
secular government can be saved,'' said Jilani, a senior leader of
the All India Babri Masjid Action Committee.
   Babri Masjid, or the Mosque of Babar, was built in the 17th
century in Ayodhya on the spot where Hindu fundamentalists claim
one of their most popular gods, Lord Ram, was born.
   About 90 minutes after the Moslems were arrested in Faizabad, a
frenzied mob of Hindu worshipers celebrated the placing of the
foundation stone of a new temple to Ram about 120 feet from the
Babri Masjid. They flung marigold petals into a 6-foot hole where
their leaders reverently placed a pile of bricks and a cornerstone.
   Police wearing helmets and chest protectors struggled to keep
from falling into the pit as at least 5,000 pilgrims pushed into
the small hilltop enclave in less than an hour.
   The Hindu-Moslem dispute over the Ayodhya hilltop is centuries
old, but the the current furor centers on who owns the land where
the foundation is being laid for a new Hindu temple. Hindus and
Moslems had agreed that one tiny plot that was to hold the
foundation stone was owned by a Hindu.
   The rest of the land needed to complete the new Ram temple is
disputed.
   While the Moslems opposed the construction of the new temple,
they agreed they could not prevent its foundation stone from being
placed on the little plot owned by a Hindu.
   So far the courts in Uttar Pradesh state, where the government
is headed by Gandhi's Congress Party, have declined to rule who
actually owns the property.
   The demonstrators in Faizabad vowed today to turn the Moslem
votes away from Gandhi in national elections scheduled Nov. 22, 24
and 26.
   ``After today, Moslems will not vote for Congress,'' said
Mohammad Azam Khan, an Uttar Pradesh state legislator from the
opposition Janata Party, or People's Party.
   Hindus make up about 83 percent of India's 880 million people.
While Moslems make up 11 percent of the population, they have voted
heavily for the Congress Party since India became independent from
Britain in 1947.
   With Gandhi facing a tough challenge this month from Vishwanath
Pratap Singh, leader of the National Front coalition, the Moslem
vote could be pivotal.

   Police arrested thousands more Hindu
pilgrims Sunday, including a member of a Hindu royal family, in an
attempt to avoid more bloodshed in a dispute over a Moslem shrine
in this town.
   The Hindu-Moslem conflict over the shrine claimed at least 96
lives in rioting last week and has jeopardized Prime Minister V.P.
Singh's government.
   More than 60,000 people were arrested by Saturday as troops
sealed off Ayodhya and the borders of Uttar Pradesh state from a
swarm of Hindu pilgrims.
   Police gave no figure for the number of arrests Sunday, but
Press Trust of India and United News of India said 15,000 were
detained at one southern border crossing.
   Among them was Vijaya Raje Scindia, vice president of the
right-wing Hindu party Bharatiya Janata. She was the maharani, or
princess, of Gwalior before India abolished princely states 20
years ago.
   Mrs. Scindia was arrested on charges of ``violating a
prohibitory order,'' United News reported. The state government had
banned the leaders of several Hindu fundamentalist groups from the
state.
   The news agencies said 300 truckloads of Hindu pilgrims
accompanying Mrs. Scindia were driven to temporary jails in schools
and public areas around the state. Twelve members of Parliament
also were detained by police forming a security net around the
shrine.
   ``It's like a war zone. Not even an ant can get past us,'' said
one police officer protecting the shrine.
   The controversy is centered on a 16th century mosque, the Babri
Masjid, in this town of 40,000 people about 300 miles southeast of
New Delhi.
   Hindu fundamentalists say the mosque stands on the birthplace of
the god Rama. They say they will replace the structure with a
temple and have set Wednesday for beginning construction.
   The government, saying it is obliged to defend minority
interests, has pledged not to allow the mosque to be displaced
until the courts decide the issue.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support from Singh's
National Front coalition Tuesday. Singh's minority government
depended on the Hindu party and the Communist-led Left Front for
its survival.
   A United News report quoted Singh as saying Sunday that the
Hindu party was trying to ``usurp power, even at the cost of
communal conflagration and the country's unity.''
   Singh must face a vote of confidence in Parliament on Nov. 7.
The Bharatiya Janata and the opposition Congress party have said
they will vote against Singh, which virtually assures his defeat.
   Elections are likely early next year.
   ``The (political) matter is closed. It is with the security
forces now, and they will do their duty,'' said the police official
at a barricade on the road to Aydohya. Heavily armed policemen
manned the barrier.
   All entry points to Ayodhya in a 60-mile radius are blocked by
barricades, he said. The national railway suspended service through
the state.
   About 200,000 policemen and paramilitary forces have fanned
across the state. In Ayodya, an indefinite curfew imposed Friday
was lifted for just two hours Sunday afternoon.
   Officials refuse to say how many policemen are deployed around
the shrine, but some officers said the figure was about 20,000.
Policemen lounged in the shade of narrow lanes leading to the
shrine, playing with monkeys who inhabit the area.
   Moslems comprise 30 percent of the 120 million people in Uttar
Pradesh.
   Though Moslems are only 12 percent of India's 880 million
people, they live in almost every Indian state. Hindus are 82
percent of the population.
   Religious tensions between Hindus and Moslems erupt
periodically, and dozens of people are killed in clashes every
year.

   Police arrested 1,000 Moslem protesters
Friday who tried to march to nearby Ayodhya, where celebrating
Hindus laid the foundation stone of a new temple at a site claimed
by both religions.
   The Moslem demonstration was peaceful, but Zafaryab Jilani, one
of its leaders, declared: ``When all these methods fail, arms are
taken up. The next generation may not listen to peaceful protest.''
   At least 290 people have been killed in Hindu-Moslem violence in
three Indian states since plans for the temple were announced in
August. No violence has been reported in Faizabad or Ayodhya.
   Protest leaders in Faizabad accused Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
and his Congress Party of giving in to Hindu fundamentalists in a
quest for Hindu votes in national elections set for Nov. 22, 24 an
26.
   ``If this ruling Congress Party is ousted from power, perhaps
secular government can be saved,'' said Jilani, a senior leader of
the All-India Babri Masjid Action Committee.
   Babri Masjid, the Mosque of Babar, was built in the 17th century
on the spot in Ayodhya where Hindu fundamentalists claim one of
their most popular gods, Lord Ram, was born.
   About 90 minutes after the arrests in Faizabad, Hindus
celebrated the laying of the foundation stone of a new Ram temple
130 feet from the Babar Mosque. They flung marigold petals into a
6-foot-deep hole in which their leaders reverently placed bricks
and the stone.
   Police wearing helmets and chest protectors struggled to keep
from falling into the pit as at least 5,000 pilgrims pushed into
the small, hilltop enclave in less than an hour.
   The dispute over the Ayodhya hilltop in Uttar Pradesh state is
centuries old and the current chapter began on a night in 1949,
when a Ram idol was spirited into the mosque. A court ordered the
mosque closed to people of both faiths in an effort to prevent
religious strife.
   In 1986, another court order opened the Babar Mosque, but only
to Hindus. That decision prompted riots across India in which at
least 200 people died.
   Currently, the argument centers on who owns the land where the
foundation is being laid. Hindus and Moslems agree the small plot
intended for the stone is owned by a Hindu, but the rest of the
landed needed for the temple remains in dispute.
   Although Moslems opposed construction of the temple, they agreed
they could not prevent the stone from being laid in the plot owned
by a Hindu.
   Late Thursday night, however, Moslem activists contended the
foundation site was spilling over to property they claim is Moslem.
   Courts in Uttar Pradesh state, where Gandhi's Congress Party
controls the government, have declined to rule who owns the
property.
   ``After today, Moslems will not vote for Congress,'' Mohammad
Azam Khan, an Uttar Pradesh state legislator from the opposition
Janata Party, said Friday.
   Azam, like Jilani, is a convenor _ a sort of senior organizer _
of the Babri Masjid Action Committee. Both were among those
arrested in Faizabad.
   The arrests were part of a uniquely Indian form of peaceful
protest in which people do something they know police will not
allow, such as marching to Ayodhya, thus inviting arrest. The
police oblige by rounding them up, generally with little or no
force.
   In Faizabad, the Moslems and at least 40 Hindu sympathizers
climbed willingly into freight-hauling trucks and waved as they
were driven to a police compound on the outskirts.
   At the compound, they sat on the ground listening to leaders
exhort them to preserve India as a secular state and vote Gandhi
and his party out of office.
   Moslems, who make up 11 percent of India's 880 million people,
have given the Congress Party strong support since India's
independence from Britain in 1947. Gandhi faces a tough challenge
from Vishwanath Pratap Singh, leader of the National Front
coalition, and the Moslem vote could be pivotal.

   Hindus and Moslems fought with knives and
guns in scattered violence today, leaving at least seven more
people dead, and more troops were sent to guard a disputed holy
site in this northeastern city.
   The dispute over the site has pushed the government to the brink
of collapse and violence stemming from it has left at least 158
people dead in the past week. On Tuesday night, the violence spread
to neighboring Bangladesh.
   Troops killed five people and wounded at least 20 in Ayodhya on
Tuesday when thousands of Hindu militants broke through police
barricades and forced their way to a 460-year-old mosque they want
to replace with a Hindu temple.
   Hindu fundamentalists had vowed to start construction Tuesday on
a temple to the Hindu god Rama on the site, which they revere as
the god's birthplace.
   The fundamentalists say the mosque should be razed to make way
for a Hindu temple in this holy town 300 miles southeast of New
Delhi. Hindus make up 82 percent of India's population. Moslems
comprise 12 percent.
   At least 45 people died in street battles Tuesday and today in
six states, mostly in cities with large Moslem minorities, as the
decades-old Hindu-Moslem dispute over the ownership of the site
came to a head.
   One Hindu man committed suicide Tuesday in protest.
   Today's deaths, from stabbings and shootings, occurred in what
Indian news agencies described as mob violence in four widely
separated cities in western and southern India. Indian news reports
do not identify victims or give many details, in the belief that
doing so would aggravate tensions.
   In Bangladesh, gangs of Moslems armed with knives or clubs
attacked at least 11 Hindu temples and smashed idols in the
southern port of Chittagong Tuesday night to protest the Ayodhya
episode. Hundreds of Hindu homes and shops were burned, but no
injuries were reported.
   Police imposed a curfew on the city at dawn today. No injuries
or arrests were reported.
   The Ayodhya dispute has has brought Prime Minister V.P. Singh's
government to the verge of collapse.
   Authorities deployed additional troops around the disputed
shrine today and blocked the bridge across the sacred Saryu River,
where 6,000 Hindus had gathered..
   The devotees sat in the fields opposite the town and sang hymns,
and the anger of the previous day seemed to have eased.
   Tuesday's widespread violence prompted Singh to renew an offer
to resign. Singh's 11-month-old coalition lost its majority in
Parliament last week when an allied right-wing Hindu party withdrew
support over the temple issue.
   Singh has been under mounting pressure from dissidents in his
party to quit. He faces a parliamentary vote of no-confidence on
Nov. 7, and his letter offering to step down seemed to presuppose
that the government will lose.
   ``All energies should be directed to diffuse the situation and
maintain communal harmony. It is in the pursuit of these goals that
we have sacrificed a whole government,'' he wrote to the president
of his Janata Dal party.
   ``My conscience is clear that I have sacrificed the highest
office for the cause of unity of the country and the oppressed,''
he wrote.
   The letter was dismissed by the Janata Dal dissidents as an
attempt by Singh to rally his supporters. The party is to meet
early next week to decide the leadership question.
   Most political analysts predict elections within a few months
and a possible return to government by former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's Congress Party, which governed India for all but four of
its 43 years of independence.
   At least 900 people were killed in Hindu-Moslem violence last
year after the Hindu group announced its plans to replace the
mosque with a temple.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Plan to Freeze Hindu-Moslem Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, trying to defuse a
Hindu-Moslem dispute that has claimed scores of lives, proposed
Friday to allow Hindus to build a temple at a sacred site without
destroying a mosque already there.
   But Hindu traditionalists rejected the plan, which was unveiled
at the end of a frantic day of meetings and two sessions of Prime
Minister V.P. Singh's Cabinet.
   Singh's government is under threat of collapse if no solution to
the conflict is found by the end of the month.
   The dispute concerns a 16th century mosque in the holy town of
Ayodhya. Hindus say it was built on the foundations of a temple
over the traditional birthplace of the Hindu god Rama.
   A fundamentalist group, the Hindu World Council, has vowed to
begin rebuilding the temple on Oct. 30. Moslems have said they
won't let that happen.
   Officials fear a bloodbath unless a settlement is found. Riots
between the two religious communities have claimed thousands of
lives over the decades, and violence over Ayodhya left more than 80
people dead earlier in the month.
   The secretary of the Hindu group, Ashok Singhal, said the
government plan was unacceptable because it left the mosque in
place.
   The government has said it will not allow the mosque to be
displaced, and has urged all sides to await the decision of the
courts on dozens of petitions.
   Police and paramilitary forces have sealed off Ayodhya, 300
miles east of New Delhi, and about 5,000 Hindu politicians and
activists have been detained.
   Information Minister Parvatheneni Upendra said the prime
minister's plan calls for the government to acquire properties
around the disputed site. Land would be made available for the
construction of a temple, while cases pending before a local court
could be transfered to the Supreme Court for quick handling.
Meanwhile, the mosque would stay.
   Upendra said the Bharatiya Janata, a right-wing Hindu party that
is a key government ally, had indicated it might support the prime
minister's plan. But a Bharatiya Janata leader denied that.
   ``It seems the government is more keen to assuage the sentiments
and protect the interests of the Moslem community with disregard to
the sentiments of tens of millions of the overwhelming majority,''
said party secretary J.P. Mathur.
   Lal Krishna Advani, head of Bharatiya Janata, has been leading a
6,000-mile pilgrimage to rally public opinion for the temple. Army
troops were deployed along the route of his caravan.
   Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people, while
Moslems make up 12 percent of the population.

   Swearing devotion to the Hindu god Ram
and a willingness to die for their beliefs, hundreds of young men
set out Saturday with sanctified bricks on a mission that has
spurred Hindu-Moslem riots and caused at least 280 deaths.
   Their destination is Ayodhya, 325 miles to the southeast, where
plans for a new Hindu temple have propelled religious strife to the
forefront of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's battle for re-election.
   From the width and depth of India, convoys of trucks and buses
are heading to Ayodhya in the heart of Uttar Pradesh, India's most
populous state and a bellwether in elections. In their wake,
Moslems and Hindus have shot, stabbed and burned each other to
death.
   ``To put up the bricks for the Hindus, this is important,'' said
Rajesh Kumar, a 19-year-old English student who joined the
procession of seven buses and at least four trucks that left New
Delhi on Saturday.
   ``The name of the god Ram is enough to defend ourselves,'' he
said, then patted a holster containing a brass trident with sharp
spears. ``The blade is less than 4 inches, so it's legally
permitted,'' he said with a grin. ``This is just a symbol, not a
weapon.''
   Some of the young men carried sabers and hockey sticks, which
older organizers hastened to describe as religious symbols or
evidence of youthful sportsmanship.
   On Thursday, ardent Hindus plan to lay the foundation for a new
temple to Lord Ram in Ayodhya next to a disputed shrine claimed by
both Moslems and Hindus.
   Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the fundamentalist group behind the
temple drive, says it has gathered bricks from more than 375,000
cities and towns throughout India and from Hindus in Canada, the
United States and Western Europe. After being blessed by Hindu holy
men, the bricks are borne by believers and festooned with bright
red and orange satin and chiffon, tied up with tinsel and garlanded
with marigolds.
   This joyous celebration of religious right has left a trail of
death in villages where Hindus and Moslems have lived side by side
for centuries.
   Hindu-Moslem clashes are particularly worrisome now.
   With national elections barely three weeks away, both Gandhi and
opposition leader Vishwanath Pratap Singh have been urging
religious harmony while at the same time trying not to alienate the
Hindu fundamentalist vote or the potentially pivotal vote of
Moslems, who make up 11 percent of the population. Hindus account
for 82 percent.
   Gandhi officially launched his campaign Friday in Faizabad, four
miles down the road from Ayodhya, with an accusation that unnamed
opposition parties were ``fanning communal feelings for their
vested political interests.''
   ``Communalism'' is the catchword Indian politicians and news
media use for religious strife in an effort to avoid singling out
specific faiths or being perceived as taking sides.
   Back in New Delhi, Singh of the opposition National Front
coalition was accusing Gandhi's Congress Party of trying to turn
Ayodhya into ``a flashpoint'' of communal violence.
   Many participants in Saturday's send-off of the convoy said they
would vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party. This right-wing Hindu
party is not a member of the National Front but has been making
deals with the front for a share of the Parliament seats to be
determined in the elections being conducted Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   The young men making the trip, as well as older ones encouraging
them, vowed that the journey would be peaceful unless ``the
Mohammedans'' started something or the government failed to
maintain order.
   In late October, similar ``Ram shila,'' or Ram brick,
processions precipitated several days of Hindu-Moslem clashes in
Bihar state. At least 201 people died by official count, which does
not specify the victims' religions.
   Indian newspapers have given indications that many, perhaps
most, of the victims were Moslems. When the dead and wounded have
been identified, the names have usually been Islamic.
   In addition to the October deaths, about 80 other people have
been killed in Bihar and four other states since August when plans
were announced to build the temple at Ayodhya, revered by Hindus as
Ram's birthplace.
   The New Delhi convoy of trucks and buses, with their load of
5,045 bricks and about 300 men, is to pass through towns with
sizeable Moslem populations.
   ``What can we say about trouble?'' asked R.K. Mathur, a
40-year-old music teacher attired in blue denim jeans and jacket.
``We are going on our mission.''
   Manesh Gupta, a 19-year-old photographer, added: ``If we die, it
is no problem _ 100 percent, no problem.''

<DATELINE>PUSHKAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This town of cobblestone streets and
sparkling white houses is a long way from anywhere in India, but
millions cross a desert every year to get to it and wash away their
sins in its holy lake.
   Pushkar is a place revered by Hindus and even by some foreigners
who seek out its tranquility.
   Its beginnings lie with Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe
in Hindu mythology. Hindu texts have it that when Brahma was
seeking a place for a holy ceremony, he chose Pushkar.
   He dropped a lotus from his hand and water spouted from the
desert to form a lake, according to the texts that date from the
8th century B.C.
   In these modern times, as the sun rises, Hindu pilgrims chant
mantras and take a dip in Pushkar Lake, believing all their sins
will be washed away by the holy waters.
   Europeans and Americans often are seen by the lake, sharing the
religious experience. They feed grain to pigeons and sweets to
long-tailed monkeys who scramble across the pinnacles of the town's
400 temples where ascetics, Hindu monks and other holy men gather.
   Pushkar, a town of 9,000 people, is an oasis of tranquility, far
removed from the bustling cities and teeming slums of Bombay, New
Delhi and Calcutta.
   The blazing sun soaks into everything.
   It was the sacred month of Kartik, signifying the onset of
winter, when Lord Brahma is said to have dropped his lotus blossom.
   Brahma, foremost in the Hindu trinity of supreme gods, had been
looking for a suitable site to perform a major religious ceremony.
   But his wife, Savitri, could not attend the ritual. Angered, she
decreed that henceforth Brahma would be worshiped at only one place.
   Pushkar became the sole earthly home of the peaceful god of
creation, while millions of shrines were erected across India to
Lord Shiva the destroyer and to ferocious goddesses like Kali and
Durga who are often depicted as fire-spitting images carrying heads
of evil men they had slain in battle.
   But this oasis in the desert emerged as a major holy town for
the Hindus, almost equal in importance to Benaras, the ``eternal
city.'' Hindus believe that one goes to heaven if one dies in
Benaras.
   Pilgrims come by the thousands to Pushkar, 250 miles southwest
of New Delhi, to bathe in the lake and revive the memory of
Brahma's majestic rite every year on Kartik Poornima, the full moon
night in the month of November.
   Shielded by Nag Pahar, or Serpent Mountain, Pushkar has India's
_ and perhaps the world's _ only temple to Brahma.
   The town centers on the lake, where there are several steps for
bathing. Signs warn foreigners ``not to wear shorts and other
revealing clothes, not to smoke, drink near the lake or take
photographs, not to kiss, embrace or indulge in other irreverent
acts.''
   The steps, called ghats, are controlled by vigilant and
aggressive brahmin priests, who preside over religious ceremonies,
armed with horoscopes. They watch every pilgrim approaching the
lake and pounce on potential clients.
   Each visit is recorded in their bulky, cloth-covered books. A
priest can easily tell a devotee when his grandfather visited
Pushkar by referring to the dog-eared notebooks.
   Displeasing a priest can be unpleasant. He will pronounce curses
on one's entire family, naming all _ the grandfather, father and
sons.
   From the lake, the steps lead up to the main street, a favorite
shopping center with the tourists. The shops are stacked with
exotic handicrafts, peasant skirts and other clothes native to this
part of India. Velvet shirts and pajamas, musts for low-budget
travelers, hang in vibrant displays.

   Government forces fired on thousands of
Hindu fundamentalists who broke through police barricades Tuesday
and forced their way into a heavily guarded mosque. Five Hindus
were killed and 20 wounded.
   At least 26 people were killed in other parts of India as the
decades-old dispute between Hindus and Moslems over ownership of
the site came to a head.
   The controversy has left at least 138 people dead in the past
week, brought Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government close to
collapse and further strained already tense relations between
India's Hindu majority and Moslem minority.

   Moslem mosque, on Tuesday repeated his offer to resign if his party
thought it would help contain the sectarian violence. He made a
similar offer Monday.
   Hindu fundamentalists had said they would start construction
Tuesday on a temple to the god Rama on the site occupied by the
mosque. The government said it would block any attempt to destroy
the small, one-story shrine and arrested 90,000 supporters of the
fundamentalist World Hindu Council in the past week.
   On Tuesday, 10,000 Hindus stormed police barricades outside the
disputed shrine. Police first used tear gas and bamboo canes to
beat back the crowd.
   Then, after several hours of clashes as the crowds pushed closer
and closer to the mosque, the police fired rifles.
   Reporters saw four bodies, but a government spokesman in New
Delhi later said five people were killed. Witnesses said at least
20 people were wounded.
   S.K. Gupta, a doctor at a local hospital, said 13 of the injured
were in serious condition. ``They have only 10 percent chances of
survival,'' he said.
   Thousands of young men wearing orange headbands, the color of
the Hind faith, broke through successive police cordons, entered
the small mosque, pried bricks from the wall and chipped bits of
plaster from its three domes. They planted an orange flag on each
dome before police chased them away.
   Many Hindus said they were helped by policemen guarding the
mosque, which the fundamentalists say stands on the spot where Rama
was born. Most of the 20,000 policemen on duty in Ayodhya are
Hindus.
   While the crowds rushed toward the mosque, Hindu holy men
screamed obscenities from rooftops and pelted police with stones.
At least four policemen were injured.
   As news spread that the police barricades had been breached,
hundreds of Hindus poured into the streets of Ayodhya in defiance
of the 4-day-old curfew that had confined them to their homes. Many
distributed candy and exploded firecrackers to shouts of ``Jai siya
Rama!'' - ``Victory to Rama!''
   Many policemen were seen entering the disputed shrine to pray.
   The World Hindu Council said its success in penetrating police
lines meant the temple project had begun.
   ``In my 19 years of service, I have never experienced such a
sense of failure,'' a senior government official at the site said
on condition of anonymity. ``It was a collapse of the
administration.''
   Later, paramilitary troops cleared the shrine of intruders and
threatened to open fire if any further attempts were made to breach
the barricades.
   The government's chief spokesman, Ramamohan Rao, said the mosque
was not seriously damaged. He spoke in New Delhi, 300 miles
northwest of Ayodhya.
   In several towns hundreds of miles from Ayodhya, Hindus and
Moslems fought street battles and police opened fire on rioting
mobs. In those incidents, 25 were killed in street battles and the
police firing, while one Hindu committed suicide in protest.
   The army was called out in two towns in the western state of
Gujarat. Police in New Delhi said the situation in the capital was
tense and troops were alert for trouble.
   Prime Minister Singh's government lost its patchwork majority in
Parliament last week after The Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party
withdrew support over the government's stand on the Ayodhya
dispute.
   On Tuesday, Singh offered to resign if his party felt ``that
change of leadership will serve larger goals.''
   ``What is closest to my heart is that at this juncture the
country be saved from communal flames,'' Singh said in a letter to
his Janata Dal party president, Somappa Rayappa Bommai.
   Singh is scheduled to face a vote of confidence Nov. 7.
Bharatiya Janata has said it will oppose Singh's continuing in
office.
   The Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the
largest group in Parliament, has made a similar announcement. The
Congress and Bharatiya Janata together hold 281 seats - a majority
in the 522-member Parliament.
   Bharatiya Janata says Singh's policy on the dispute is aimed at
garnering Moslem votes. The Congress accused him of faulty
administration that brought the Hindu-Moslem dispute to a boil.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people.
Athough India is constitutionally a secular nation, Hindus comprise
82 percent of the population and have always held the prime
minister's post.
   At least 900 people were killed in Hindu-Moslem violence last
year after the Hindu group announced plans to replace the mosque
with a temple.

FT  11 FEB 94 / Arts: A living picture of Hinduism - Patricia Morison finds
much more than sacred cows at the British Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hinduism is not well understood in the west, even though many of its
individual features are familiar. One thinks of sacred cows, many-armed
dancing gods, Hari Krishna, titillating stories of tantric excesses, TV
epics and yogis who stand for years on one leg. The difficulty most people
have is fitting these colourful elements into a coherent picture of the
everyday religion of modern India.
For Deities and Devotion at the British Museum, Richard Blurton, its curator
of oriental antiquities, has trawled the Museum's magnificent resources of
Hindu art, and borrowed some others - in particular from the scandalously
inaccessible hoard in the Victorian and Albert Museum. His aim is simple and
admirably achieved: to explain and 'demystify' Hinduism.
By the end of this century, Blurton points out, the Indian population will
outstrip China's. Since the majority of Indians are Hindus, it behoves us
all to form a picture of Hinduism as a living, evolving faith - although the
resurgence of intolerant, militant Hindu fundamentalism is rather
overlooked.
It is a beautiful show; but, more importantly, it sets out examples of Hindu
devotional art, ancient and modern, to teach the essentials of the religion.
The gallery looks stunning in red and saffron yellow, a remarkable
improvement on the BM's customary boring world of grey and white. I
particularly liked the calligraphy by Sehmi Satwinder of Alphabet Soups.
An exceptionally large quantity of Indian paintings is on view, lit dimly to
protect them but brilliantly colourful. In the first section introducing the
principal gods, there is a series of miniatures from Rajasthan of around
1800 depicting Vishnu in his ten orthodox incarnations. Here we find
battling Rama of the Ramayana epic, playful Krishna, and Buddha, an example
of a historical individual subsumed into the pantheon. Few of us would
identify the splendid white parade-horse with a parasol attached to his
saddle as the last incarnation of Vishnu as horse-headed Kalki, as he is yet
to show himself.
Cruder images of gods abound from all over India; on comics, palm-leaf
books, on the scrolls used by professional story-tellers, and on cheap and
cheerful prints sold to pilgrims. The textiles are gorgeous and two in
particular. An enormous 17th-century silk cloth made in Assam is cunningly
woven with little images and text describing Vishnu's incarnations. Until
last year it was in storage at the Museum of Mankind, misclassified as
Thibetan.
As for a painted cotton hanging from Rajasthan, the BM should have it copied
and put into production. On a sky-blue ground five rows of spritely white
cows advancing towards each other, three to a side. Their horns and humps
are coloured orange in honour of the festival which marks Krishna's erotic
encounter with the milkmaids, or gopi.
Instead of the gopi, the cows are being urged on by images of a turbanned
figure, the 15th-century holy man, Vallabhacharya. His devotion to Krishna
helped push him into the first league of gods. At the same time but in a
different corner of India, a holy man called Chaitanya founded the Hari
Krishna sect whose accolytes now jingle their way along Oxford Street.
So one learns from Richard Blurton's helpful and attractively illustrated
book, Hindu Art (British Museum Press, Pounds 14.95). Vallabhacharya's
followers in Rajasthan have a tradition of making marvellous temple hangings
like the cow-cloth, because they believe Krishna must live as elegantly and
comfortably as possible. Their personal aim is 'to live as full a material
life as possible', making this one Indian sect FT readers might like to
explore further.
By the end of Deities and Devotions, we have learned a lot. We have been
introduced to some dozen gods, from amiable elephant-headed Ganesh to Kali
the Destroyer and Jagganatha of Puri, whose festival car gave us the word
juggernaut. Photographs and exhibits have evoked pilgrimages, rural
religion, temple architecture, the rituals of worship, and Hinduism today.
Crucially, we have learned about the concept of darshan, the supreme moment
of devotion when the Hindu believer makes eye-contact with the image of the
god enshrined in the inner sanctum of the temple. Darshan is represented in
the centre of the exhibition, in the adoring gaze fixed by a statue of
Nandi, Shiva's patiently waiting bull-mount, on his master.
Shiva is here represented by an extremely fine 15th-century statue of him as
teacher, but by this point we have understood something of the many faces
and paradoxes of Shiva. He is both auspicious and inauspicious, male and
female, represented as linga and yoni, which is to say phallus and vulva,
the god of ecstasy and of transcendance. In this statue, his face is benign,
and under his foot he treads the dwarf who symbolises Ignorance.
It was such an image which Diderot misunderstood to show a god who tore
apart young children. This exhibition stands in an honourable tradition of
dispelling ignorance and bringing Indian religion to a wider public.
Until April 19, sponsored by Bajaj Auto, Birla Technical Services and
Mukand.

<DATELINE>PUSHKAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This town of cobblestone streets and
sparkling white houses is a long way from anywhere in India, but
millions cross a desert every year to get to it and wash away their
sins in its holy lake.
   Pushkar is a place revered by Hindus and even by some foreigners
who seek out its tranquility.
   Its beginnings lie with Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe
in Hindu mythology. Hindu texts have it that when Brahma was
seeking a place for a holy ceremony, he chose Pushkar.
   He dropped a lotus from his hand and water spouted from the
desert to form a lake, according to the texts that date from the
8th century B.C.
   In these modern times, as the sun rises, Hindu pilgrims chant
mantras and take a dip in Pushkar Lake, believing all their sins
will be washed away by the holy waters.
   Europeans and Americans often are seen by the lake, sharing the
religious experience. They feed grain to pigeons and sweets to
long-tailed monkeys who scramble across the pinnacles of the town's
400 temples where ascetics, Hindu monks and other holy men gather.
   Pushkar, a town of 9,000 people, is an oasis of tranquility, far
removed from the bustling cities and teeming slums of Bombay, New
Delhi and Calcutta.
   The blazing sun soaks into everything.
   It was the sacred month of Kartik, signifying the onset of
winter, when Lord Brahma is said to have dropped his lotus blossom.
   Brahma, foremost in the Hindu trinity of supreme gods, had been
looking for a suitable site to perform a major religious ceremony.
   But his wife, Savitri, could not attend the ritual. Angered, she
decreed that henceforth Brahma would be worshiped at only one place.
   Pushkar became the sole earthly home of the peaceful god of
creation, while millions of shrines were erected across India to
Lord Shiva the destroyer and to ferocious goddesses like Kali and
Durga who are often depicted as fire-spitting images carrying heads
of evil men they had slain in battle.
   But this oasis in the desert emerged as a major holy town for
the Hindus, almost equal in importance to Benaras, the ``eternal
city.'' Hindus believe that one goes to heaven if one dies in
Benaras.
   Pilgrims come by the thousands to Pushkar, 250 miles southwest
of New Delhi, to bathe in the lake and revive the memory of
Brahma's majestic rite every year on Kartik Poornima, the full moon
night in the month of November.
   Shielded by Nag Pahar, or Serpent Mountain, Pushkar has India's
_ and perhaps the world's _ only temple to Brahma.
   The town centers on the lake, where there are several steps for
bathing. Signs warn foreigners ``not to wear shorts and other
revealing clothes, not to smoke, drink near the lake or take
photographs, not to kiss, embrace or indulge in other irreverent
acts.''
   The steps, called ghats, are controlled by vigilant and
aggressive brahmin priests, who preside over religious ceremonies,
armed with horoscopes. They watch every pilgrim approaching the
lake and pounce on potential clients.
   Each visit is recorded in their bulky, cloth-covered books. A
priest can easily tell a devotee when his grandfather visited
Pushkar by referring to the dog-eared notebooks.
   Displeasing a priest can be unpleasant. He will pronounce curses
on one's entire family, naming all _ the grandfather, father and
sons.
   From the lake, the steps lead up to the main street, a favorite
shopping center with the tourists. The shops are stacked with
exotic handicrafts, peasant skirts and other clothes native to this
part of India. Velvet shirts and pajamas, musts for low-budget
travelers, hang in vibrant displays.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh on Monday
appealed for a peaceful resolution to a religious site dispute that
has caused violent Hindu-Moslem clashes and could threaten the
Singh's coalition government.
   ``Religious fanaticism is the first step towards the foundation
for a theocratic state. It will be the death of India as a secular
state,'' Singh said during a 20-minute televised speech.
   At least 80 people have died this year in battles over a 16th
century mosque, the Babri Masjid, in Ayodhya, about 310 miles east
of New Delhi.
   Hindus believe the town was the birthplace of a god, Rama, and
want to dismantle the mosque, claiming it was built by Mogul rulers
on the foundations of an ancient Hindu temple.
   The Hindu World Council has vowed to start rebuilding the temple
Oct. 30, but a Moslem group had said it will protect the mosque.
Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people. Moslems
account for 12 percent.
   Singh said he has appointed five state chief ministers to help
``solve the issue.'' Chief ministers are the highest elected
officials of a state.
   He also asked the Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party to
work toward a nonviolent solution.
   There was no immediate reaction from the Bharatiya Janata, or
Indian People's Party. Several other political parties and groups
have unsuccessfully appealed to the party to call off its campaign.
   Singh's 10-month-old National Front coalition government needs
the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Left Front, a conglomeration of
communist groups, to remain intact.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party has threatened to withdraw support
from the government if the proposed temple construction is
disrupted.
   ``How can a country be governed in circumstances like this? Is
it necessary that the country has to be plunged into communal
chaos? Can't they wait to build the temple until a peaceful
settlement has been reached?'' asked Singh, whose Janata Dal party
comprises the largest part of the coalition government.
   ``Hundreds of governments can come and go but the nation should
remain one,'' he said. ``Government is too small a consideration
when people are involved.''
   Clashes between the Moslems and Hindus escalated last month
after Bharatiya Janata Party leader Lal Krishna Advani set off on a
6,000-mile van journey from a west Indian Hindu shrine to Ayodhya.
   Advani is scheduled to reach Ayodhya on Oct. 30. Authorities in
Uttar Pradesh state have said they may arrest Advani when he
crosses the state border.
   Fearing unrest, police already have detained more than 20,000
Hindu activists. Many road and rail links to Ayodhya have been
blocked or subject to stringent checks.

   Police killed at least 12 Hindus
attempting to storm a disputed Moslem mosque Friday, and more than
40 others died in violence as the religious dispute spread across
India to neighboring Moslem countries.
   Ten consecutive days of clashes between majority Hindus and
minority Moslems have left nearly 280 dead in India and at least
three dead in predominately Islamic Bangladesh.
   The unrest could also weaken Prime Minister V.P. Singh's chances
of surviving a Nov. 7 confidence vote. Singh lost his majority in
Parliament after Hindus withdrew from the 11-month-old coalition to
protest government handling of the mosque dispute.
   Fundamentalist Hindus seek to destroy the hilltop Babri Mosque
and build a a Hindu temple on the site in Ayodhya, 300 miles
southeast of New Delhi.
   Hindus say the 460-year-old mosque was built on the foundation
of an early temple marking the birthplace of Rama, the
much-worshiped warrior god. Moslems dispute the history and say
relinquishing the mosque would jeopardize hundreds of other Moslem
sites.
   Police have fired twice this week on Hindus attempting to
overrun the mosque. On Friday, a top district official said
witnesses' estimate of 12 dead was ``nearer to the truth'' than
reporters' tally of 10. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Doctors at a hospital in the nearby town of Faizabad said they
treated 64 injured people, including 48 wounded by gunfire. Several
policemen were also treated, they said.
   Reporters saw three buses and several jeeps torched by the mob.
Some homes were also burned.
   At least 25 deaths were reported in related riots across the
Uttar Pradesh state, where the mosque is located, the Press Trust
of India news agency reported.
   Thirteen more died Friday in the western state of Gujarat, the
news agency said. Other deaths were reported from Karnataka, Bihar,
Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh states.
   At least 279 people have died in India in recent violence linked
to the dispute, police and news agencies report. Last year, about
900 people were killed when a Hindu group first announced its
intention to take over the site by force.
   Most of those killed near the mosque recently were Hindus, but
authorities refuse to identify the faith of other victims out of
fear of exacerbating tensions.
   In Bangladesh, which has a Hindu minority, two people died
Friday of bullet wounds suffered during anti-Hindu protest earlier
this week in the capital of Dhaka.
   At least three people have been killed and 350 wounded in three
days of rioting in Dhaka and in 12 other cities. Two of those
killed were Moslems, and the religion of the third victim was not
immediately known.
   In Pakistan, India's predominately Islamic western neighbor,
several demonstrations were held to protest the violence and some
Islamic leaders called for larger pro-Moslem rallies.
   Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, said
the Indian government was half-heartedly protecting Moslem shrines.
   ``It was the moral duty of the Indian government to protect the
places of worship of Moslems,'' Jatoi said in a statemenet
published in the Pakistan Times. ``India, which pleads herself the
champion of secularism, has failed to give protection to holy
places of Moslems.''
   But one of those injured Friday near the mosque accused
government forces of shooting needlessly.
   ``Two policemen dragged a man out of the house and shot him in
the chest. Then they also shot two people who were crying over a
dead body. They were shot in the back,''said Bhupendra Singh
Rawat, speaking from a hospital bed.
   Rawat, a 24-year-old insurance agent from New Delhi, said he was
knocked down by a police officer's bamboo club.
   Former Indian Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, a key figure in
efforts to replace Singh, said a government comprising all parties
should be set up to defuse the crisis.
   Singh, who lost his majority in Parliament after the pro-Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew, is expected to lose the
no-confidence vote. The prime minister is also beset by moves
within his National Front coalition for a new leader.
   Some newspapers and political commentators have called the
Ayodhya dispute the greatest threat to the country's secularism
since India gained independence in 1947.
   India's 880 million people are 82 percent Hindu and 12 percent
Moslem. The others include Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists. India's
constitution pledges tolerance of all religions and secularism.

<HEAD>Death Toll Reaches 89 in Hindu-Moslem Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The religious dispute that pits Hindus
against Moslems is threatening to bring down the government, and
the death toll in the violence has risen to 89, according to news
reports today.
   United News of India reported that 71 people died Wednesday and
Thursday in religious riots in the cities of Jaipur and Jodhpur in
western Rajasthan state.
   The news agency quoted hospital sources as saying 68 bodies of
people killed in the rioting had been brought to Jaipur, and at
least three other people were known to have died.
   Elsewhere in the country, news reports said that at least 18
others had died in Hindu-Moslem clashes since Tuesday when the
leader of a right-wing Hindu party was arrested.
   Lal Krishna Advani was detained while leading a caravan across
northern Indian to rally support for a campaign to replace a 16th
century Moslem mosque with a Hindu temple in the Uttar Pradesh city
of Ayodhya. Hindus claim the mosque, built in 1528, is on the site
of the birthplace of Lord Rama, and thus is as holy to Hindus as
Mecca is to Moslems.
   The arrest of Advani, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party,
triggered riots in a half-dozen states where large Moslem
communities are mingled among the Hindu majority.
   As many as 50,000 supporters of Advani's party have been placed
under ``preventive arrest'' over the past two weeks. Indian law
allows people to be detained without charges when authorities fear
there is a threat to public safety.
   After Advani's arrest, his party withdrew its support for
Singh's coalition government, plunging India into a political
crisis. The party's defection deprived Singh of a parliamentary
majority.
   Singh said he would seek a vote of confidence on Nov. 7 to prove
he could still muster a parliamentary majority.
   But the Congress Party, the largest opposition party, said it
would oppose Singh in any vote of confidence because of his
handling of the religious dispute.
   Within Singh's fractious Janata Dal party, there appeared to be
moves under way to oust him as party leader.
   The Times of India newspaper reported a concerted effort in top
party circles to replace Singh so Janata Dal could remain in power.
   The national daily said smaller parties in the government
coalition had indicated they ``would not be adverse to support a
government minus V.P. Singh ... if it can spare the nation travails
of another parliamentary poll within a year.''
   Singh's Janata Dal party and smaller partners in his National
Front coalition government now hold 146 seats in the 522-member
policy-making lower house - the Lok Sabha, or House of the People.
   He still has the support of the Communist-led Left Front
alliance, which has 51 seats, but the loss of the 86 seats held by
the Bharatiya Janata Party has cost him his majority.
   The opposition Congress Party and its allies hold 210 seats. The
remainder are held by smaller parties and independents.
   The political crisis was triggered by a religious dispute over a
shrine in Ayodhya, a town of 40,000 in Uttar Pradesh.
   Tens of thousands of Hindus have converged on Ayodhya this week
to help build the temple. The government has dispatched tens of
thousands of police and paramilitary troops to prevent violent
clashes.
   Singh and his Janata Dal party allies who run Uttar Pradesh's
state government have tried to halt construction of the temple
until a court can rule on the religious dispute.
   Moslems comprise only 12 percent of India's 880 million people.
India is officially a secular state, but the Hindus make up 82
percent of the population and dominate the government.

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh called a
public rally today to try to contain a rebellion in his party and
put a lid on growing pressure on him to resign.
   Environment Minister Maneka Gandhi quit Singh's Cabinet on
Friday and released a letter accusing the prime minister of failing
to keep his pledge of ``honesty and efficiency in government.''
   Mrs. Gandhi was the first Cabinet minister to break openly with
Singh since Tuesday when a Hindu-Moslem dispute over rights to a
holy site ballooned into the worst political crisis of the
10-month-old government.
   Other dissidents of the governing Janata Dal party pressed for a
change of leadership, arguing that dumping Singh could avert the
government's collapse and the need for an immediate national
election.
   Singh was scheduled to speak today at a rally outside his home
in New Delhi, the capital.
   At least 93 people have been killed this week in rioting between
Moslems and Hindus and in police efforts to quell the disturbances.
The two latest deaths were reported today from a clash between
police and a mob late Friday in Ranchi in the eastern state of
Bihar.
   Police clamped an overnight curfew on Ayodhya, site of the
disputed holy place, and on the neighboring town of Faizabad on
Friday. Thousands of police reinforcements have been sent to the
Hindu holy town 300 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   Hindu fundamentalists have vowed to build a temple at the site
which they say is birthplace of Lord Rama, an important Hindu god.
A Moslem mosque has stood there for 460 years.
   Police said they have detained 51,000 people in Uttar Pradesh
state and seized more than 35,000 tribal spears, tridents and other
weapons from Hindus on their way to Ayodhya.
   The Uttar Pradesh government has banned entry into the state by
leaders of the Hindu political movements behind the temple project.
   The right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew its support for
the government when Singh opposed the temple and arrested the
party's leader, who was on a cross-country march to rouse support
for the construction.
   The party's move deprived the National Front coalition of its
majority in Parliament.
   Singh faces a no-confidence motion in a special session of the
legislature Nov. 7. Barring a last-minute compromise or a
realignment of political forces, he seems certain to lose.
   In addition to Mrs. Gandhi, four other Parliament members once
considered close to Singh joined the call for him to step down even
before the vote.

   Police fatally shot at least 10 Hindu
fundamentalists today, repulsing a renewed assault on a Moslem
mosque in a religious dispute that has left more than 250 people
dead nationwide.
   More than 60 people and three police officers were injured in
the clash.
   The conflict has spilled into Moslem Bangladesh, where two more
people died today from anti-Hindu rioting. Pakistan's caretaker
prime minister said India is not doing enough to protect Moslem
shrines.
   About 10,000 Hindus tried to storm the hilltop Babri Mosque,
which they want to replace with a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, 300
miles southeast of New Delhi. The conflict in the northeastern town
threatens to bring down the government of Prime Minister V.P.
Singh.
   Police used tear gas and pushed back the crowds with blows from
6-foot-long bamboo staves. Reporters saw scores of people injured
before the crowd retreated down dirt alleys and into buildings.
   Police opened fire after coming under a repeated barrage of
stones from the roofs of buildings. Witnesses saw police chasing
the militants onto the roofs and firing on the crowds in the narrow
lanes below.
   Reporters counted 10 bodies in the streets and in a hospital.
Witnesses claimed more people were killed, and Hindu militants
refused to let them take away the corpses.
   Doctors at Faizabad Hospital said they treated 64 people for
injuries, including 48 hit by gunfire. Six of those injured were in
critical condition. Three injured policemen were also brought to
the hospital.
   One of the injured Hindus, Bhupendra Singh Rawat, 24, accused
the police of shooting needlessly.
   ``Two policemen dragged a man out of the house and shot him in
the chest. Then they also shot two people who were crying over a
dead body. They were shot in the back,'' he said, speaking from a
hospital bed.
   Today was the last day of a four-day pilgrimage period declared
by astrologers and Hindu holy men as the auspicious time for
beginning construction of the temple.
   At least 257 people have been killed in an unrelenting wave of
violence in six Indian states since the fighting began Oct. 24,
according to a tally of official reports and news agency accounts.
   Singh's government vowed to defend the Moslem site until the
courts decide its fate. His stand cost him his majority in
Parliament when a Hindu party withdrew its support last week.
   He faces a no-confidence motion Nov. 7, which he appears likely
to lose. Moves were afoot to replace him as leader of the Janata
Dal Party, which might rescue the governing National Front
coalition from defeat in Parliament.
   Jockeying in the Janata Dal centered on two rural-based
politicians, Devi Lal and Chandra Shekhar, who command wide
followings among lower-class Hindus. Singh was elected last year
largely on the strength of the middle class, which grew
disenchanted with the Congress Party headed by Rajiv Gandhi.
   The Ayodhya dispute ignited religious tensions in neighboring
Bangladesh, an Islamic nation with a Hindu minority. Three people
were reported killed and more than 350 were wounded in three days
of rioting in Dhaka, the capital, and in 12 other cities.
   Doctors said two people died of bullet wounds in Dhaka early
today. One Moslem businessman died Wednesday of wounds suffered in
Dhaka.
   Hindus say the 460-year-old Babri Mosque was built on the
foundation of an early Hindu temple marking the birthplace of Rama,
the much-worshiped warrior god. Moslems dispute the history of the
site and say that relinquishing the site would jeopardize hundreds
of other Moslem sites.

<P>
The surge of Hindu militance and Muslim fundamentalism that brought down the 
coalition government of Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh this month is as 
dismaying and bewildering to the average Hindu as it must be to non-Hindu 
readers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In a land as vast as Europe and with far greater ethnic, religious and 
linguistic diversity, it is imperative that a truly secular and democratic form 
of government be at India's helm, and that was exactly Singh's aim. The only 
political idea that all Indian citizens -- Hindus of all castes, Muslims, 
Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains -- can accept is the unique brand of 
"secularism" that Indians have claimed to practice since the bloody riots that 
marked the partition of the subcontinent into secular India and Muslim Pakistan 
in 1947. The state should sponsor no religion and tolerate them all. As a 
historian and a Hindu agnostic (which is not an oxymoron) I despair over the 
mindless, reactive and hysterical piety of the few that chills the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Logically and theologically, Hindu "fundamentalism" is a contradiction in 
terms. Hindus have many gods; they have scores of religious books, but no 
agreement on a "bible"; they have no organized church, only temples with 
regional and local influence. Sects with competing deities, texts, rituals and 
ideologies flourish; it is quite possible to be an atheist or an agnostic, 
observe no rituals, eat beef or be a vegetarian, and still be a good Hindu. 
</P>
<P>
There are some overarching beliefs that people largely accept: karma (action) 
and reincarnation; the notion that all human beings have an atman (self) that 
is a fraction of Brahman (universal, uncreated energy); and the sacred 
geography -- the rivers, mountains and lakes -- of the subcontinent, including 
the areas now designated as Islamic Pakistan and Bangladesh. Most important, 
Hindus must respect and honor the gods of others. Tolerance is the hallmark of 
Hinduism; to tolerate the intolerant, the monotheistic, the jihad-waging and 
the proselytizing is the test the Hindu must not fail. 
</P>
<P>
The current crisis is caused not by orthodox Hindus but a new breed of 
"protestant" Hindus who made their appearance in the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries. They include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Arya Samaj (Aryan Society), a sect that pioneered Hindu conversion and 
ceremonies to win back converts to Christianity and Islam; its members wanted 
to strip the old Hinduism of its wishy-washy, tolerant ways and (quite rightly) 
reform Hindu society's caste prejudice. The enemies were Muslims and 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS; National Volunteer Corps), formed in 
the 1920s, is an even more avowedly militant and nationalistic Hindu movement 
that fears the national ambitions of Muslims will divide the indivisible 
geographic and sacred entity of "Mother India." This and other sects of Hindu 
"reformers" fabricated a militant creed that distills nationalism, religion and 
militant protest into one volatile potion. 
</P>
<P>
The minority political party that represents this ideology, the Bharatiya 
Janata Party, supported V.P. Singh's coalition, giving him the numbers he 
needed to form a government. The party's latest tactics include opposition to 
Singh's plan to implement a broadened affirmative-action plan for the lower 
castes and support of a plan to restore about 3,000 temples that were torn down 
in the Muslim era, some of them replaced by mosques. 
</P>
<P>
The mosque in Ayodhya that has figured in the recent violence was built in 
1528, after the destruction of a 4th-Century temple that commemorated the 
birthplace of Rama, a greatly revered god of Hinduism. Yes, it was wrong for 
the 16th-Century Mughal emperor Babar to order the destruction of the temple. 
But can that wrong be undone by destroying the mosque and rebuilding the 
temple? It cannot, for a good Hindu. 
</P>
<P>
Bharatiya Janata leaders see their opportunity in a political landscape charged 
with other communal and religious agendas that fuel the fears of the Hindu 
community. A resurgent, expansionist, fundamentalist Islam is vivid in Iran, in 
the crumbling Soviet Union (India's loyal friend), and in the oil-rich gulf 
states. Within India, there are more Muslims than there are in Pakistan, and 
its only Muslim majority state, Kashmir, has a full-blown secessionist movement 
that strikes fears of a fourth war with Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
The resolutions of the last few internal crises that rocked the Muslim 
community were seen by average Hindus as cynical pandering by the long-ruling 
Congress Party to the Muslim vote at the cost of eroding the secular 
Constitution. Militant Hindus now believe that they must gain control of the 
central government to combat Islamic politics that could divide India yet 
again. But the real tragedy is that these new Hindus, born in a colonialist age 
when Muslim separatism was invented, have twisted the old Hindu way of life to 
mirror that which they dread most: a militant, fundamentalist Islam, with its 
one unforgiving God and its belief in a theocratic state.

At least 31 more people were killed Wednesday in religious violence in India 
over attempts by Hindu militants to tear down a mosque and replace it with a 
temple. 
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India news agency said 16 people were killed at the Ayodhya 
mosque in northern Uttar Pradesh state. 
</P>
<P>
More than 70 people have died nationwide since Tuesday in clashes between 
Hindus and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
India sent paramilitary reinforcements to the site and no one was allowed 
within 200 yards after battles Tuesday between the militants and security 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic news agencies reported that six people were killed and 200 injured in 
the central city of Indore in religious rioting in which people used guns and 
bombs. Four others were killed in the western state of Gujarat, three in 
Karnataka, and one each in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, both states in the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
About 700 shouting militants led by naked Hindu holy men, their bodies smeared 
with sacred ash, managed to reach the 16th-Century mosque Tuesday and caused 
minor damage before police cleared them out. 
</P>
<P>
The dusty streets of the town of 50,000 people and 3,000 temples were virtually 
deserted Wednesday. Muslim leaders were relieved that the mosque was not 
seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, dozens of towns were under curfew and militant Hindus called strikes 
to back their campaign to build a temple on what they say is the birthplace of 
the god, Ram.

<HEAD>India's Religious Dispute is 105 Years Old</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The religious dispute that has killed
more than 200 people in nine days and threatened to bring down the
government has its roots in a 105-year-old court case.
   In 1885, a Hindu priest filed a lawsuit claiming a small plot of
land in the town of Ayodhya was the birthplace of the Lord Rama,
the much-revered warrior-god. The priest also claimed that the
unpretentious three-domed mosque on the site was built over what
had once been a Hindu temple.
   Sixty-one years later, the court decreed that the site was a
mosque and dismissed the priest's claim.
   The legal snarl was revived in 1949 when an idol of Rama was
spirited into the building. The mosque was locked by court order
and closed to people of both faiths in an effort to prevent
religious strife.
   In 1986, another court order re-opened the mosque, but only to
Hindus. Riots over the decision killed at least 200 people.
   Around the same time, the fundamentalist World Hindu Council
called for the removal of the 460-year-old Babri mosque and the
construction of a temple in its place.
   The group was not particularly well-known at the time, but it
gathered increasing support. In 1989, it announced definitive plans
for the temple construction and said it would raise $14 million for
the project.
   Religious riots broke out again, this time claiming at least 900
lives.
   After a year of futile government efforts to halt the campaign,
the group said Hindu holy men had deemed Oct. 30, 1990, as an
auspicious day to start the construction.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government vowed to halt the
attempt, although this stand cost it the support of the Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party. The desertion relegated the government to a
minority in Parliament.
   Singh faces the possibility of losing a vote of confidence Nov.
7.
   On Tuesday, thousands of Hindus stormed the mosque. At least
seven people died when police opened fire, but many youths broke
through security cordons, raced through the narrow, winding lanes
leading to the site and planted orange Hindu flags on the domes.
   Three more bodies were later found in a river and were thought
to be victims of Tuesday's violence.
   What is most worrisome about the outbreak of violence, say
newspapers and political commentators, is the widespread support
the Hindu campaign has received, which could foreshadow an unending
cycle of religious strife.
   India's 880 million people are 82 percent Hindu and 12 percent
Moslem, but the country has been officialy secular since it gained
independence in 1947. Hindu-Moslem riots have periodically flared
but usually have been sparked by local issues and quickly resolved.
   ``India is entering a period when all the values it cherishes
are in peril,'' The Statesman newspaper editorialized Thursday.
``On the survival of this one mosque may depend the survival of
India as we know it.''

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's party broke
apart today, leaving the government in disarray in a country
already seriously shaken by Hindu-Moslem violence that has claimed
more than 330 lives.
   Hindu fundamentalists vowed today to dismantle 3,000 Islamic
shrines across India. They have been thwarted at least temporarily
in their campaign to replace a mosque in the remote northern town
of Ayodhya with a temple.
   The capital, meanwhile, was brought to a near standstill by a
strike called by the right-wing Hindu party that provoked the
political and religious crisis.
   Singh won the endorsement of more than half his Janata Dal
Party's members in Parliament, but a large dissident faction
deserted him today and named its own choice for prime minister.
   The dissidents elected Chandra Shekhar, a long-time Singh
antagonist, to lead them and said they would request that President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman ask their new leader to form a government.
   Whatever happens, Singh is likely to lose, since he faces a vote
of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
   The defection from Singh's governing coalition last month of the
Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party, inspired by the arrest
of its leader for instigating unrest in the Ayodhya dispute,
triggered the political crisis.
   In the capital today, Bharatiya Janata activists blocked traffic
by deflating the tires of trucks and buses that ignored their
strike call.
   Many shops were closed. In some areas, private cars and
three-wheel motorscooter taxis were halted.
   Police were deployed on major streets. Most parents kept their
children home from school, fearing trouble.
   Bharatiya Janata was protesting the killings by police of at
least 22 Hindu fundamentalists who were shot last week trying to
replace the Ayodhya mosque with a temple.
   Nationwide, more than 300 othe people have been burned,
stabbed, shot or hacked to death in Hindu-Moslem riots or when
police opened fire to disperse rampaging mobs.
   The position of the beleaguered Singh worsened today with the
resignation of a sixth minister in his 38-member Cabinet.
   Minister of State for Communications Janeshwar Mishra submitted
his resignation shortly before Singh's showdown with his Janata Dal
Party, United News of India said. The string of desertions began
nearly two weeks ago.
   The daily lurch toward disintegration leaves the entire
government in question. If the Janata Dal ousts Singh, it's still
questionable whether a new party leader can forge the coalition
support necessary to stay in power. India could then be headed for
new elections four years ahead of schedule.
   Ayodhya itself, the flashpoint for the sectarian dispute, was
calm this morning, a day after Hindu leaders suspended their
campaign to seize the mosque after claiming to have reached an
accord with authorities.
   But the stage was set for new confrontations between the Hindu
majority and the Moslem minority when a Hindu fundamentalist leader
vowed to dismantle 3,000 mosques nationwide and replace them with
Hindu temples.
   Ashok Singhal, general secretary of the World Hindu Council,
told reporters in Ayodhya that his group would beef up its militant
youth wing and expand efforts.
   ``Earlier we wanted three, but now, seeing the government
operation on Hindus, we have decided that we will dismantle 3,000
mosques,'' Singhal said.
   The mosques are those that Singhal and others feel are on Hindu
holy sites. The Hindus want a temple at Ayodhya to honor Ram, the
warrior-god who is one of the most popular Hindu deities.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party, which had tacitly supported Singh's
government since he took office as prime minister Dec. 2, 1989, had
fervently supported the temple-building project. Its leader, Lal
Krishna Advani, was arrested Oct. 24 while leading a caravan of
supporters across India to Ayodhya.
   The party promptly withdrew its support, leaving Singh and his
Janata Dal Party teetering.
   Today, Janata Dal's dissident spokesman Harmohan Dhawan told
reporters that 82 of the the party's 178 members in Parliament
unanimously chose Chandra Shekhar.
   But Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, a Singh supporter, said
113 legislators met separately at Parliament and voted unanimously
to support Singh. The figures could not immediately be reconciled.
   Janata Dal was created to unseat former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi and his Congress Party, which had virtually monopolized
political power in India since the country won independence from
Britain in 1947.
   The party was united by little more than anti-Gandhi sentiments,
and the crisis in Ayodhya was all it took for ex-Deputy Prime
Minister Devi Lal, a top Singh foe in the party, and others to make
their move.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people, but in
close elections the Moslem minority of 12 percent is crucial.

   Special trains carried people from
riot-torn areas near a disputed mosque Saturday as fundamentalist
Hindus debated whether to keep up efforts to seize the site.
   At least 305 deaths have been reported across India in unrest
linked to attempts by Hindus to raze the 16th century mosque and
build a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, about 300 miles southeast of New
Delhi.
   At least 13 people died Saturday in areas around Ayodhya,
including a police constable who had suffered head wounds during
Hindu attempts to storm the mosque Friday.
   Police, meanwhile, arrested a newspaper editor and blocked
distribution of 10 Hindi-language newspapers for allegedly
misreporting the distrubances that have raged since Oct. 24.
   The editor of the weekly newspaper Swatantra Chetna was arrested
on charges of inciting communal violence through exaggerated
reporting, and officials in the city of Varanasi filed court cases
against several dailies, the United News of India agency reported
Saturday.
   All the newspapers are published in Uttar Pradesh state, the
center of the religious conflict. The agency said 200 journalists
who protested the police action in Varanasi were briefly arrested.
   Police with shoot-on-sight orders patrolled five northern Indian
towns under curfew, but did not interfere with people heading
toward the bus and train stations in Ayodhya.
   All rail service to the area was halted last week as part of the
government's effort to keep temple activists from reaching Ayodhya.
Three special trains were dispatched to the town Saturday.
   The sectarian violence has brought Prime Minister V.P. Singh's
11-month-old coalition government to the brink of collapse. Singh,
who faces a confidence vote Wednesday, lost his majority in
Parliament when a right-wing Hindu party withdrew support because
of the Ayodhya dispute.
   In Ayodhya, Hindu leaders debated whether to continue attempts
to take control of the 460-year-old mosque, which they claim was
built on the foundation of an early temple marking the birthplace
of the god Rama.
   Moslems dispute the history and say relinquishing the mosque
would jeopardize hundreds of other Moslem sites.
   Leaders of the World Hindu Council, the group leading the
temple-building project, are split over the best tactic to pursue
next.
   Nritya Gopal Das, an Ayodhya priest and a local leader of the
council, has been asking people to leave town, saying they had
achieved victory Tuesday when they stormed the mosque and pried a
few bricks from its walls and chipped concrete from the domed roof.
   But a national leader of the council, general secretary Ashok
Singhal, has been urging people to stay until the temple is
constructed.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people, while
Moslems comprise 12 percent.
   In Bangladesh, authorities relaxed curfews in the capital of
Dhaka and Chittagong for 10 hours Saturday after several days of
anti-Hindu riots across the predominately Moslem nation.
   At least four people have died and more than 400 were injured in
the violence that started Tuesday in Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
   A right-wing Hindu party deserted Prime
Minister V.P. Singh's coalition Tuesday, depriving the government
of a parliamentary majority. But Singh pledged to hang on to power.
   The walkout was prompted by the arrest Tuesday of the rightist
party's leader, who had stirred tension between Hindus and Moslems
by campaigning for a new Hindu temple on the site of a Moslem
mosque.
   Singh went on national television to appeal for calm, fearing
the political turmoil arising from a conflict between Hindus and
Moslems could provoke violence.
   ``At this moment, and it is a very tense moment, my heart goes
out to the innocent children, men, women who today are under
tension and under fear,'' he said.
   Initial reports said scattered violence erupted around the
country. United News of India said three people were stabbed to
death during rioting in Ahmedabad in western India.
   At least 80 people died this month in riots between Hindus and
Moslems. They usually were set off by minor squabbles, but were
attributed to the Hindu temple dispute.
   Despite the defection, Singh said he was not quitting and will
command enough support to maintain his 10-month-old government when
Parliament reconvenes. Privately, his aides said it was unlikely
the government would complete its four-year term and an early
election was probable next year.
   The legislature is in recess for another three weeks, although
President Ramaswamy Venkataraman has the power to convene it early.
   Venkataraman could let events in Parliament take their course
when it begins its session next month. He also could ask the
opposition Congress Party, the largest in Parliament, to try to
form a new government, or he could call early elections.
   ``The government has been transferred from intensive care to the
terminal ward,'' said V.N. Gadgil, a Congress Party spokesman. His
party was ousted in last year's election.
   Officials in Singh's Janata Dal Party said they believed the
Hindu party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, would stop short of voting
against the government, since there was no viable alternative.
   The Hindu party's leaders said they would consider rejoining
Singh's coalition if Singh were replaced.
   Singh's minority National Front government relied on the Hindu
party and on the Communist-led Left Front to stay in office.
Neither was formally part of the government.
   The political crisis was prompted by the arrest of the Hindu
party's president, Lal Krishna Advani, during his cross-country
crusade for building a Hindu temple where a mosque now stands in
the Hindu holy town of Ayodhya.
   Advani was detained at dawn near the village of Samastipur, 450
miles southeast of New Delhi.
   Charges against Advani were not published. But up to 20,000 of
his supporters were put under preventative arrest to stop what
authorities feared could become a bloodbath between the two
communities. The Hindu party claimed the figure was closer to
50,000.
   Hindus say the 16th century mosque was built on the ruins of an
earlier temple on the site where the Hindu god Lord Rama was born.
A fundamentalist Hindu group says it will begin building a new
temple there Oct. 30, defying a court injunction.
   Thousands of Moslems and Hindus have died in the long history of
communal bloodshed in the Indian subcontinent. Violence prompted
the partition of colonial India into Moslem Pakistan and
predominantly Hindu India when Britain granted independence in
1947.

   Suspected Sikh extremists threw a bomb
Sunday into a crowd watching a Hindu religious series on a
community television, killing at least 15 people and injuring about
30 others, a news agency said.
   The attack was carried out in a market in the town of
Kurukshetra in northern Haryana state, according to the Press Trust
of India news agency. The town is considered holy by Hindus.
   Six of the injured were reported in critical condition at local
hospitals, it said.
   It reported the market was littered with limbs and torn flesh of
the victims.
   The attack came as the crowd and an estimated 100 million
Indians tuned in to state-run television nationwide to watch the
weekly ``Ramayana'' show, which recounts the adventures of the
Hindu god Lord Rama.
   The town of Kurukshetra is holy to Hindus because it was there
that Lord Krishna, an incarnation of one of Hindu's trinity of
gods, gave a lecture on battling for righteousness. His army later
went on to defeat a rival Aryan tribe.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war for an
independent homeland in Punjab since 1982.
   Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an
alternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminated
against by India's majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2
percent of India's 800 million people but are a majority in Punjab.
   Earlier Sunday, Punjab police said that three policemen were
killed overnight in two separate attacks by Sikh radicals. They
also were blamed for the death Sunday of a Sikh farmer in central
Punjab.
   Also Sunday, Sikh radicals ambushed a car carrying a militant
Hindu leader in Punjab state, killing him, his bodyguard and an
aide, the news agency said.
   The Hindu leader was identified as Rama Kant Jalota, president
of the Punjab Shiv Sena, or army of Shiva. The Shiv Sena views
itself as a defender of Hindus and their religion.
   The news agency said Jalota's car was attacked as he was en
route to Jalandhar, which is a district capital 50 miles southeast
of Amritsar.
   The latest killings raised to more than 1,320 the number of
people killed by the radicals in Punjab since the start of the
year. Last year, 1,030 people died.
   Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed
to the militants' separatist campaign. The radicals have at times
targeted police, government officials and their families.
   Sunday's attack was the second bombing by Sikh extremists
outside Punjab in less than a month.
   On May 20, a series of bombs went off on several buses in
Himachal Pradesh state northeast of Punjab. At least 10 people died.
   The last Sikh attack in Haryana, south of Punjab, came on May 8,
when Sikh extremists attacked a Hindu wedding party. At least 14
people were killed and 26 injured.

<DATELINE>AYODHYA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hindu leaders on Sunday suspended a
campaign to seize a mosque after claiming to reach an accord with
authorities, but officials said no concessions were made to end the
dispute that has left at least 325 dead.
   In New Delhi, meanwhile, moves to oust Prime Minister V.P. Singh
grew while opponents worked for compromises to prevent new
Parliament elections.
   Despite the signs of calm in Ayodhya, about 300 miles southeast
of New Delhi, violence linked to the mosque flared in neighboring
nations. At least two Moslems were killed by a Hindu mob in Nepal,
and security around Hindu temples in Pakistan was increased to
prevent Moslem attacks.
   The Hindu militants said they reached a deal with civil
authorities to allow them to visit the disputed holy site on
Wednesday.
   Ashok Singhal, who was at the forefront of the Hindu assault on
the mosque last week, called on thousands of pilgrims in Ayodhya to
end the seige and hold a traditional Hindu fire ceremony to mark
the end of a significant event.
   Singhal said a prayer meeting would start Monday and conclude
Wednesday with a visit to the 460-year-old mosque, which they claim
was built atop the birthplace of the Hindu warrior god Rama.
   But authorities said they had not yet decided to lift a curfew
on Ayodhya that would let the prayer meeting go ahead.
   Hindus seek to raze the mosque and erect a Hindu temple on the
site.
   A handwritten statement from Singhal, leader of the World Hindu
Council, said a public meeting would be held Nov. 11 in New Delhi
to decide the future campaign for the temple project.
   Sources said the fundamentalists had presented four demands for
ending the standoff.
   Among the requests is the lifting of a 10-day-old curfew in
Ayodhya, allowing Hindu worshipers to visit the disputed shrine,
and the release of Hindus arrested while attempting to start
construction of the temple.
   But sources indicated Hindu leaders were prepared to drop a
demand for the suspension of officers who ordered police toopen
fire on rampaging mobs Tuesday and Friday. At least 22 people were
killed in the two incidents, among at least 325 killed nationwide
in the dispute.
   About 4,000 Hindus from across the country have left Ayodhya in
the past few days, ignoring pleas from their leaders to stay until
the temple is built. An estimated 10,000 remain.
   The dispute was touched off when the leader of a Hindu
right-wing party, Lal Krishna Advani, was arrested Oct. 24 while
leading a caravan to Ayodhya to help build the proposed temple.
   Since the arrest, riots have spread across India and neighboring
nations. It has also brought Singh's 11-month-old coalition
government to the brink of collapse.
   Singh, who faces a confidence vote Wednesday, lost his majority
in Parliament when the pro-Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew
support because of the Ayodhya dispute.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people, while
Moslems comprise 12 percent.
   On Sunday, two ministers resigned from the government, raising
to five the number in the 38-member Cabinet who deserted Singh in
the last two weeks.
   Meanwhile, two Singh opponents in his Janata Dal Party said they
plan a meeting Monday with other dissident party members. They hope
to dump Singh as party leader and prime minister in hopes of
preserving the government and averting parliamentary elections.
   But Advani, who was released Sunday, said new elections were the
only way out of the political impasse.
   ``This government has forfeited both its moral and political
right to continue even for a single day,'' he said.
   In Nepal, two Moslems who allegedly defiled a Hindu temple were
killed Saturday when Hindus stormed a house where they were being
held to await authorities. Five people were injured in the incident
in Harion, about 50 miles south of Katmandu, the Home Ministry
said.
   Moslems comprise only 3 percent of Nepal's 16 million people.
Ninety percent are Hindu.
   In mainly Moslem Pakistan, police and army troops increased
patrols around Hindu temples Sunday after several attacks,
including an attempt Saturday to blow up a temple in the southern
port city of Karachi, newspaper reports said.

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's embattled
government Wednesday became the first ever ousted by a Parliament
vote, collapsing under political divisions and controversy over
religious and caste bloodshed.
   Following the vote, Singh convened his defeated Cabinet to
endorse his resignation letter to President Ramaswamy Venkataraman.
The two are expected to meet Thursday.
   ``We aren't going with our heads down. This is a struggle. We
struggled in government. We will continue outside,'' Singh said.
   The 11-month-old coalition government was shaken by continued
separatist struggles in Kashmir and Punjab states, rising prices
and Singh's program to raise the government job quota for low-caste
Hindus. The policy launched widespread clashes and a wave of
suicides among upper-caste Hindus.
   The government was ultimately crippled last month when a
fundamentalist Hindu group withdrew from the coalition in protest
over a mosque dispute, which has left more than 365 people dead.
   The 11-hour debate ended with a 346-142 vote against the
government, with eight abstentions. The vote was greeted with
cheers and the thumping of desks.
   It was the first time an Indian government was ousted by a vote
of Parliament since independence in 1947.
   ``The Lok Sabht ``unleashed every illicit force ... every raw
nerve was exposed,'' Gandhi said. ``This government has reduced the
credibility of this nation in the eyes of the world.''
   India's rules of succession in the event of the government's
fall are vague and leave some discretion to the president. By
custom, Venkataraman should give Gandhi first chance to form a new
government because his Congress party is the largest.
   Gandhi has said he doesn't want the job right now and will
support Chandra Shekhar's breakaway Janata Dal faction. Chandra
Shekhar is known to have 58 supporters from the Janata Dal.
Congress has 195 members in the 522-member Lok Sabha.
   Unrest over Hindu attempts to raze a mosque and build a temple
on the site raged even while lawmakers met to oust Singh's
government.
   Four more people were killed in Uttar Pradesh state and a
17-year-old student burned himself to death in New Delhi to protest
the government's opposition to the temple project in Ayodhya, about
300 miles east of New Delhi. Fundamentalist Hindus claim the
460-year-old mosque stands on the birthplace of the warrior-god
Rama. They want to destroy the mosque and build a temple.
   At least 368 people have died in the dispute since late October
across India, and others have been killed in related unrest in the
neighboring nations of Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
   Singh's government lost its majority in Parliament Oct. 23 when
the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew following the arrest
of its leader while on a cross-country march to muster support for
the temple.
   Singh said he does not oppose building a temple, but he wouldn't
allow the Moslem holy place to be overrun. He turned the issue into
a battle to defend secularism against the Hindu radicalism.
   Since Singh's Aug. 7 announcement to guarantee about half of all
civil service jobs to low-caste Hindus, at least 67 students have
committed suicide and 67 have died in street clashes with police.
   About 82 percent of India's 800 million people are Hindus and 12
percent are Moslem.
   In Jammu-Kashmir state, where Moslem separatists seek autonomy,
at least 270 people have died this year. About 600 have been killed
in the northwestern Punjab state in violence linked to a separatist
struggle by Sikh militants.
   Singh likened the new government to a 25-horsepower vehicle
being dragged backwards by a huge trailer. He said Chandra Shekhar
had no mandate from the people to be prime minister, and accused
him of political opportunism.

   Millions of Hindus invoking their ancient
faith's countless gods and goddesses converged Sunday at the
confluence of three rivers whose waters are thought to hold the
power to wash away sins and end the cycle of birth and rebirth.
   ``At least 10 million people have already come. It's already a
sea of humanity,'' said Ravindra Gupta, pointing at the flow of
worshipers arriving in this central city for the Kumbh Mela, listed
in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's biggest
religious gathering.
   ``People have already started taking their holy baths. They do
not want to take a chance tomorrow (Monday),'' said Gupta,
Allahabad's chief administrator.
   He said he expects 15 million people at the river banks Monday.
   The holy fair is held every 12 years by the lunar calendar at the
time of a rare planetary convergence: Jupiter in Taurus, the sun and
moon in Capricorn, and a complicated Hindu astronomical calculation
of other planets and stars.
   The Kumbh Mela began Jan. 14 and lasts seven weeks, but Monday is
considered the most auspicious time for bathing in the sacred rivers
_ the Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati _ because it is the day
of the new moon.
   This year, police on horseback, in jeeps, at observation posts
and on foot are keeping close vigils for fear Sikh extremists might
launch attacks at the fair.
   ``We are ready for everything,'' said Trinath Mishra, deputy
inspector general of police in Uttar Pradesh state.
   ``This fair is a sitting duck for terrorists, but we are no
goose,'' Mishra said. ``We can counter any eventualities.''
   About 12,000 policemen and 5,000 militiamen have been deployed
around the 3,000-acre fair site. There are 25 police watchtowers
equipped with television monitors, 25 police posts, 10 river police
stations and 22 fire stations.
   Soldiers at a nearby army base are on alert.
   Allahabad is more than 425 miles from Punjab state, where radical
Sikhs have been waging a separatist war against India's Hindu
majority.
   But Sikh gunmen and bombers, who have killed about 200 people so
far this year, are so feared that distance offers little consolation.
   In the Hindi language, ``kumbh'' means pot and ``mela'' means
fair. The festival's name is derived from a fight over a pot of
nectar.
   According to Hindu mythology, gods and demons were waging a war
of attrition when each side realized it needed nectar to achieve
immortality and victory. The nectar was hidden beneath an ocean, so
the combatants churned the waters. The pot of nectar flew out and
was seized by Vishnu, the god of creation, who fled across the
heavens.
   During Vishnu's flight, drops of nectar fell at 12 spots. Four of
the sites, including Allahabad, are in India, while the rest are in
heaven.
   Holy fairs are held at the three other Indian sites, but
Allahabad is considered the holiest site because it lies at the
confluence of three sacred rivers.
   The pilgrims will bathe in the Ganges and Yamuna. The Saraswati
is invisible to the human eye, but Hindu faithful believe it flows
under the ground.
   They also believe that if they bathe at the exact spot where the
nectar fell _ and at the most auspicious time _ they will receive
salvation from the birth cycle.
   Hindus believe every human is born and after death is reborn.
True salvation is when the human soul escapes this cycle and becomes
a higher being.
   The rush to the rivers has proved fatal in past years.
   More than 50 people died in a stampede in 1986 at a fair in
Hardwar, and in 1954, about 800 pilgrims died in a stampede at
Allahabad. The various holy sites conduct their festivals in
different years because of different planetary configurations.
   Other disasters have befallen the festivals. In 1760, about
18,000 people died at Hardwar in clashes between different Hindu
sects.
   ``In a big fair like this, you have no option but to leave
certain things to fate,'' said M.P. Ashnata, chief government
spokesman for Uttar Pradesh state. ``We can try to prevent a
stampede, but God forbid if it happens, what can you do?''
   On a more mundane level, authorities have tried to cope with
logistical problems by providing parking space for 200,000 vehicles
and docking space for 5,000 boats. At least 400 extra trains have
been routed to Allahabad.
   More than 10,000 tons of wheat, 4,000 tons of rice and 2,000 tons
of sugar have been stockpiled. Each day brings fresh deliveries of
13,000 gallons of milk, 10 tons of butter and five tons of cheese.

<HEAD>Singh Holds Rally to Contain Rebellion in His Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh called his
supporters to a rally Saturday as he attempted to contain a
rebellion by party members who want him to resign.
   In a speech to 2,000 loyalists on the lawn of his home, Singh
gave no indication he was ready to step down. He pledged his Janata
Dal party would champion the downtrodden, as he said it had done
since he took office in December.
   Environment Minister Maneka Gandhi quit Singh's Cabinet on
Friday, accusing the prime minister of failing to keep his pledge
of honesty and efficiency. Four Parliament members once considered
close to Singh called on him to step down.
   Singh faces a no-confidence motion in a special session of the
legislature Nov. 7. Barring a last-minute compromise or a political
realignment, he seems certain to lose.
   Singh has been in trouble since Tuesday, when a Hindu-Moslem
dispute over rights to a holy site ballooned into the worst
political crisis of the 10-month-old government.
   He was elected largely on the votes of the middle and educated
classes who were disenchanted with the Congress government led by
Rajiv Gandhi.
   As prime minister, Singh adopted policies aimed at expanding
support with the poor, alienating many of those who put him in
power.
   He also opposed construction of a Hindu temple at Ayodhya, where
a Moslem mosque stands. That alienated the right-wing Bharatiya
Janata Party, and without its support Singh's coalition no longer
has a majority in Parliament.
   At least 93 people died last week in rioting between Moslems and
Hindus and police efforts to quell the disturbances.
   Police on Friday night clamped a curfew on Ayodhya and on the
neighboring town of Faizabad.
   Hindu fundamentalists have vowed to build a temple at the site
which they say is birthplace of Lord Rama, a Hindu god. However,
the mosque has stood there for 460 years.
   Police said they have detained 51,000 people in Uttar Pradesh
state and seized more than 35,000 tribal spears and other weapons
from Hindus on their way to Ayodhya, 300 miles southeast of New
Delhi.

<TEXT>
   Withdrawing a job quota plan aimed at
helping lower-caste Hindus could only lead to further violence,
Prime Minister V.P. Singh said in an interview Wednesday.
   Seventy-five people have died in riots or committed suicide in
protest since the government announced Aug. 7 that it was reserving
almost half of all federal jobs for lower-caste Hindus. There are
now some 17 million unemployed educated youths in India, many of
them from the upper castes.
   Singh told the United News of India that withdrawing his job
quota program could lead to more violence.
   The expectations of lower-caste Hindus have been raised, and a
policy reversal now ``would be difficult and possibly cause more
violence,'' Singh said.
   The Supreme Court has barred implementation of the job quotas
until it determines their legality. The court has scheduled a
hearing for Oct. 25.
   Singh reiterated the government's position that the quotas will
bring about social equity for lower-caste Hindus, who have been
suppressed for centuries.
   Hindus are divided into four major castes that determine a
person's social standing and often his economic position. Modern
India, whose 880 million people are 82 percent Hindu, professes
secularism and bans discrimination on the basis of caste. However,
the traditions remain.
   Public dissatisfaction over the job quotas has been widespread
in the politically influential cities of northern India. The army
has been called out, and curfews imposed in several towns because
of rioting.
   Northern India also has been plagued by renewed religious
violence this week, United News of India said. It said fighting
between Hindus and Moslems has claimed at least 40 lives in three
days in the region.
   The violence was apparently triggered by a Hindu group's
decision to build a temple at a site claimed by Moslems. The Hindus
say they will begin constructing the temple Oct. 30 in the town of
Ayodhya, 325 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   A 16th century mosque stands at the site, which the Hindus say
they will tear down. Hindus claim the mosque is built over the
birthplace of Lord Rama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, one of the
most important Hindu gods.
   The Bharatiya Janata, or Indian People's Party, which backs
Singh's government, has supported the plan for the temple. Party
president Lal Krishna Advani last month began a 6,200 mile journey
through eight Indian states to gain support for it.
   Last year, at least 900 people died in Hindu-Moslem violence
after the Hindus first announced their decision to build the
temple.

   Police arrested 163 fundamentalist
Hindus on Monday and stopped them from laying the foundation of a
shrine at a place of worship claimed both by the Hindus and Moslems.
   The disputed site, in Ayodhya about 240 miles east of New Delhi,
was the focus of bloody Hindu-Moslem clashes last year.
   Indian news reports said two groups of Hindu devotees were
stopped from going to Ayodhya to lay a foundation for a Hindu
temple. The arrests Monday brought to 313 the number of
fundamentalists detained since Saturday in the area.
   Bricks for the temple's foundation were also seized, the reports
said. Police also sealed off roads leading to the disputed site.
   Ayodhya was at the center of a controversy between Hindus and
Moslems last year and led to the deaths of about 300 people in
clashes in three states.
   Last August, Hindu fundamentalists announced they would build a
new temple to their god, Ram, on the site of a 17th century mosque
in Ayodhya. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which backs the temple
program, maintains the mosque was built atop an ancient Hindu
temple marking the spot where the group says Ram was born 900,000
years ago.
   Most of the deaths occurred in late October in Bihar state, next
to Ayodhya's Uttar Pradesh state, as bricks for the temple were
borne by Hindu processions to the dusty town on the Saryu River.
   The controversy, which occurred shortly before national
elections, is thought to have hurt former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi. Gandhi's Congress Party lost the election and was replaced
by Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   The problems in Ayodhya also contributed to worsening ties with
Moslem Pakistan. During the troubles last year, Pakistan Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto made several statements in support of
India's Moslems.
   Relations between the two countries have deteriorated further
because of a bloody separatist campaign in India's state of
Jammu-Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the campaign
with arms and training. Pakistan denies the charge and says India
is crushing a movement for self-determination.
   Since Jan. 20 when India launched a crackdown in Kashmir, at
least 349 people have died in the state.
   Twelve percent of India's 880 million people are Moslems and 82
percent are Hindus.

INDIA faced a political and constitutional crisis last night after Hindu
militants stormed and demolished an ancient mosque in Ayodhya, prompting
widespread fears of communal violence across the country.
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, appealed for calm, even as
regulatory police orders were imposed and the army alerted in many Indian
states. Addressing the nation on television, Mr Rao said his government
would go to any length to promote secularism and appealed to every citizen
to co-operate with it.
Tension escalated in several communally-sensitive states as news spread that
the disputed mosque had been demolished by hordes of Hindu militants, who
had converged on Ayodhya over the past week to protest against the
government's failure to resolve the issue.
Some 200 para-military police were inside the barricades at the time they
were stormed. But within minutes they had retreated to a nearby building and
played no further part, as a section of the 200,000 Hindus stormed the
barricades and clambered on top of the mosque's three dilapidated domes. The
religious chants of holy men were drowned in a violent melee as Hindu
fanatics ignored their leaders and demolished the mosque's weak structure
with tridents, daggers and even bare hands.
Within three hours, all three domes had been reduced to rubble, which was
carried away as souvenirs by a jubilant crowd that had accomplished what the
courts and successive governments at the centre had been trying to prevent.
The few hundred paramilitary police standing guard within the mosque did
little to hide their sympathy for the militants.
The 16th century Babri mosque, which was built on a temple site claimed by
Hindus to be the birthplace of the god, Ram, has come to symbolise India as
a secular state, guaranteed by the Constitution. The right-wing Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has, over the past three years, become the
largest opposition party by politicising a dispute that dates back to
independence.
Government direct rule was imposed in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest and
most politically crucial state, where Ayodhya is located. Mr Kalyan Singh,
the chief minister, who won power in an election 18 months ago on a promise
to build a Hindu temple on the site where the mosque now stands, resigned
late last evening. Hours later, his government, supported by the Bharatiya
Janata Party, was dismissed by Mr Rao for its inability to abide by the
Supreme court order to protect the disputed structure.
A special hearing of India's highest court was convened to assess the 'grave
constitutional crisis' caused by a constitutionally elected government not
being able to uphold the court's orders.
'This is the first time that an assurance by the state government that it
will protect the structure and carry out the court orders has been
violated,' the bench said. 'Innocent lives have been put to danger all over
the country.'
The Hindu militants, dressed in saffron robes and chanting religious
slogans, defied court orders and disobeyed the same Hindu political leaders
who had used the temple issue to muster support for a Hindu nation.
The BJP and some leaders of its more militant allies, the Vishwa Hindu
Parishad and the Rashtriya Swayam Sewak Sangh, termed the Ayodhya incident
'unfortunate', but said it was 'an indication of the depth of popular
feeling about the construction of a Hindu temple' where the mosque now
stands.
The leaders reiterated their commitment to construct the temple as thousands
continued to mill around the disputed site.
The army was alerted in six Indian states, and an indefinite curfew imposed
in Uttar Pradesh.

At least 32 more people were killed Thursday in religious strife across India 
over a militant Hindu campaign to build a temple where a mosque now stands, 
domestic news agencies said. 
</P>
<P>
"More blood may spill before there is peace," said Mulayam Singh Yadav, chief 
minister of Uttar Pradesh state, who has organized the defense of the mosque in 
the town of Ayodhya. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people were killed Thursday in Uttar Pradesh and seven in Gujarat. 
They are two of the states most seriously affected by Hindu-Muslim riots that 
erupted after an abortive attempt Tuesday by Hindus to raze the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of towns across India -- an overwhelmingly Hindu land of 850 million 
people with a minority of 100 million Muslims -- were placed under curfew. 
</P>
<P>
"This is pure politics, not religion. Where there is a political problem, there 
can only be a political solution," Yadav, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At least six people were killed Tuesday in Ayodhya, an ancient town of 50,000 
people and 3,000 temples, when militants tried to tear down a 16th-Century 
mosque that is reputed to stand on the birthplace of the Hindu god Ram, hero of 
the epic Ramayana. 
</P>
<P>
Hindus say the mosque was built in 1528 by Emperor Babur who first demolished a 
temple dedicated to Ram. Muslims say they will defend the mosque at any cost.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Hindu militants start to build Ayodhya temple: The start of
construction is in defiance of an assurance to central government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW erupted in the Indian parliament yesterday after Hindu militants on
Thursday openly defied a court order and began construction of a Hindu
temple on the site of a disputed 16th-century mosque at Ayodhya.
Five thousand Hindu activists from the militant right-wing Vishwa Hindu
Parishad (VHP) poured into the dusty town near Lucknow with truckloads of
gravel and sand, and three concrete mixers as prominent Hindu leaders
performed the ritual of pouring gravel on the foundation stone, laid almost
three years ago. The Hindus want to build a temple on the site because they
say the Hindu god Lord Ram was born there.
The symbolic start of the temple construction was in open defiance of the
Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s assurance to the central government
that it would respect the verdict of the courts. The VHP is a radical wing
of the BJP.
A court order forbids the construction or demolition of any permanent
structure on the disputed site. While Hindu activists have not dared to
invade the barbed wire fencing around the ancient Babri mosque, they have
demolished other smaller structures on the site.
The move, which is seen as politically expedient rather than religiously
motivated, has escalated tension between Hindus and Moslems in northern
India.
The BJP which wrested power in Uttar Pradesh, where Ayodhya is located, a
year ago, on the promise that they would build the Hindu temple, against all
odds, has been unable to contain the enthusiasm that it whipped up on the
temple issue two years ago.
Mr SB Chavan, the Indian home minister has summoned Mr Kalyan Singh,the
Uttar Pradesh chief minister to New Delhi, to ask for an explanation. Mr
Singh, who has been under tremendous pressure to deliver on his main
electoral promise to build the temple, has allowed the commencement of the
construction to appease the militant wing of his party.

<HEAD>Hindus Break Ground For Temple At Disputed Site</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   AYODHYA, India AP) _ Tens of thousands of militant Hindus stood
guard today with tridents and bows and arrows as priests broke
ground for a temple at a religious site claimed by both Hindus and
Moslems.
   More than 1,000 Hindu pilgrims stood solemnly as four
consecrated bricks passed over their heads and were placed on the
ground as a symbol of the foundation they say they will begin
digging Friday.
   Hundreds of security troops surrounded the disputed shrine,
watched from rooftops and lined the roads leading to Ayodhya, a
town of 35,000 people some 325 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   The massive police and paramilitary presence indicated the
lengths the government has taken to prevent violence between
members of the two faiths.
   At least 290 people, mostly Moslems, have been killed in
religious riots across other parts of India because of plans to
build the temple.
   If ever completed, the temple would engulf a disputed 17th
century shrine claimed by followers of both religions.
   Moslems, who comprise 11 percent of India's 880 million people,
say the shrine is the Babri Masjid, or mosque of the Moghal emperor
Babar.
   Hindus, who comprise 82 percent of the population, claim the
mosque was built over the birthplace of the Lord Ram, an
incarnation of Vishnu, one of the supreme trinity of gods.
   The dispute over the squat, white buildings with three domes
dates back to the 19th century but erupted afresh in August after
the militant Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Conference of Hindus,
announced plans to build a new temple.
   The ceremony prompted the government to put police and the army
on a state of alert across northern India. Additional forces were
patrolling cities with significant Moslem populations, including
New Delhi, Home Ministry officials said on condition of anonymity.
   The issue also has become a focal point for India's general
elections, scheduled for Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   Asked if construction would begin before the elections, Surya
Krishna, joint secretary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, replied:
``Within a month.''
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who faces a strong challenge for
re-election from an opposition coalition, is unwilling to risk
alienating the majority Hindus. He is equally unwilling to risk the
minority Moslem votes, which traditionally have gone in favor of
his Congress Party.
   Vishwanah Pratap Singh, leader of the opposition coalition, has
also avoided taking sides on the dispute.
   Both have urged moderation and tolerance by members of both
faiths, without giving any specific suggestions on how to resolve
the problem.
   Singh had planned to be in Ayodhya on today to try to keep
tensions from boiling into violence. However, he remained in the
town of Faizabad, about four miles away.
   Asked why, he replied, ``This is part of Ayodhya.''

   Riots that exploded around a rundown
little mosque in Ayodhya last week threaten the concept of secular
government on which religiously diverse India prides itself. More
than 300 people have been killed.
   The strife comes at a time when Indian politicians, lacking
clear-cut ideologies, are defining their vote blocs by religion.
   Police with shoot-on-sight orders patrolled five northern Indian
towns Saturday after renewed Hindu-Moslem clashes claimed 13 more
lives, the Press Trust of India said. Police also said more victims
were discovered from clashes Friday, bringing the overall death
total to at least 305.
   The issue has shaken Prime Minister V.P. Singh's centrist
government, which gained power 11 months ago. It is in trouble
because it lost the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a
right-wing Hindu group. Singh faces a confidence vote Wednesday.
   Singh might soon be deposed or relegated to a caretaker role,
which would leave India limping toward new elections four years
ahead of schedule.
   Both the riots and government crisis were precipitated by the
efforts of Hindu fundamentalists to build a temple where they
believe the god Rama was born, which happens to be under the
Ayodhya mosque. The Bharatiya Janata fervently espoused the temple
project.
   Emboldened by its make-or-break position in the government, the
party claims to speak for India's Hindu majority.
   Its rhetoric, however, often resembles that of an embattled
minority - especially after Singh, a Hindu, tried to halt the
temple project while the courts sorted out conflicting Hindu-Moslem
claims to the site.
   Moslemsare only 12 percent of India's 880 million people and
tend to keep a low profile, especially when it comes to
confrontation with the Hindu majority of 82 percent. Despite this,
they went to court in an effort to save the 460-year-old Ayodhya
mosque, fearing that if it went, others would follow.
   The Moslem suit provoked a tempestuous reaction.
   ``They want to swallow the whole of India,'' said Vijay Kumar
Malhotra, secretary of the Bharatiya Janata and a parliamentarian.
``They have the government siding with them. The Indian home
minister is a Moslem. In India, to be a Hindu has become a crime.''
   A year ago, Indians were anxious for change and weary of
allegations of corruption against Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. They
splintered their vote; nobody won, everyone lost.
   Gandhi's Congress Party got 37 percent of the 522 Parliament
seats, Singh's National Front coalition got 27 percent and the
Bharatiya Janata bounced from near-obscurity to 17 percent. Singh
teamed with the Bharatiya Janata and the Communists to forge a
majority.
   There was little discernible difference in the platforms of
democratic socialism presented by the Congress Party and National
Front, and the Communists stood only slightly to the left.
   Even the Bharatiya Janata's written manifesto was similar to
those of the Congress and the National Front, but its oratory
appealed to a nationalism that increasingly tended toward Hindu
fundamentalism.
   Because Singh's coalition was considered shaky from the start,
everyone started anticipating new elections and staking out
constituencies.
   The Moslems minority can be pivotal in close elections. The
Congress Party and National Front compete for the Moslem vote and
need to win Hindus back from the Bharatiya Janata.
   ``More and more riots are becoming political statements,'' said
Ashis Nandy, a political analyst with the Center for the Study of
Developing Societies, an independent think tank.
   Many analysts say religious blocs have become more important in
the absence of ideological constituencies. Almost any issue, such
as Ayodhya, that entices or placates one group alienates or
threatens another.
   ``Religion is being used as a political tool,'' said Rev. Arokia
Doss, a Jesuit theologian who studies the interaction of India's
different faiths.
   M.J. Akbar, Congress Party spokesman, singled out the Bharatiya
Janata Party for blame in the Ayodhya violence, but added:
   ``You can get freedom by winning a war of independence. A nation
can be formed by a revolution, but the state only stabilizes after
its civil war.''
   Akbar, a Moslem who has written extensively on India's internal
frictions, would not characterize India's current situation as
civil war, but ``a process of confrontation in order to achieve
political power.''
   Although riots and rebellions are frequent in India, it also has
a rich history of nonviolent protest and religious tolerance.
   It broke free of British colonial rule in 1947 through peaceful
protests and strikes led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, revered as the
Mahatma, or ``Great Soul.''
   On the verge of that independence, however, it broke apart on
religious lines and was partitioned into India, predominately
Hindu, and Pakistan, overwhelmingly Moslem.
   There was a bloody transmigration in which 1 million people
died, but nearly as many Moslems remain in India as now live in
Pakistan.
   Memories of those violent days continue to stir Hindu-Moslem
antagonism, but Nandy found one legacy of hope.
   ``Even after a million killed, we could go back to a normal
life,'' he said. ``It left its scars, but one could go back to
civilized living. But that's the optimistic view.''
   The pessimistic view?
   ``Each party will continue to play its own games.''

   At least 18 people were killed today in
riots and by police nationwide during a strike called by a
right-wing Hindu party that is trying to bring down Prime Minister
V.P. Singh's government.
   Singh said he will prove on Nov. 7 that he can muster a majority
in Parliament despite the defection of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
Whether he can do so is questionable. India could soon face new
elections.
   The government called a special one-day session of Parliament on
Nov. 7. The reports of violence during today's strike came mostly
from small cities and towns in western and southern India where
both Hindus and Moslems live.
   The violence and the political crisis were precipitated when Lal
Krishna Advani, president of Bharatiya Janata Party, was arrested
at sunrise Tuesday while leading a cross-country caravan to build a
Hindu temple on ground now occupied by a 16th-century Moslem
mosque.
   Five people died Tuesday night in riots in the western state of
Gujarat and police shot to death one person today in Ahmedabad, the
state's largest city.
   Another nine people were killed today in riots and clashes
between police and Hindu demonstrators in Jaipur, capital of
Rajasthan state that lies between Gujarat and New Delhi, United
News of India reported.
   One man was stabbed to death and three others died in clashes
and police firing in the southern state of Karnataka, Press Trust
of India said without elaborating. It said two people were killed
in police firing in West Bengal state.
   United News of India said two people were killed in police
firing in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.
   The news agency described the clashes as ``communal violence,''
a phrase that usually means Hindu-Moslem clashes. Indian news media
routinely avoid giving specific details in such cases, contending
that religious tension would only be heightened.
   Clashes, stone-throwing and arson also were reported in Bombay
and other major towns.
   In New Delhi, many stores were closed and the city government
pulled its 4,000 buses off the streets. Police stepped up patrols
and reported making more than 400 ``preventive arrests.''
   Such arrests are common in India where the law permits people to
be held without charge if the authorities believe public safety is
in danger.
   News reports say as many as 50,000 people have been detained in
the last two weeks in potential trouble spots.
   Singh, who took office nearly 11 months ago, told reporters he
would try to prove he has the parliamentary majority he needs to
remain in power.
   In the past, his centrist National Front relied on the support
of the Bharatiya Janata Party to pass legislation.
   The prime minister said President Ramaswamy Venkataraman had
agreed to call Parliament into session ``within a week after Oct.
30.''
   Oct. 30 is the date set by Hindu holy men and political leaders
to start constructing the temple on the site now occupied by a
mosque in Ayodhya, 300 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   The Ayodhya temple campaign has triggered violence that left
more than 80 people dead in Hindu-Moslem clashes earlier this
month. Singh sought to resolve the mosque-temple dispute in court,
but Hindu fundamentalists pressed ahead with plans to start
building the temple.
   Advani ignored Singh's pleas to call off his temple campaign. A
few hours after he was arrested, his party withdrew its support for
Singh's government.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party, or Indian People's Party, proclaims
itself to be a nationalist organization that cannot deny the
``Hindu nature'' of India. Eighty-two percent of India's 880
million people are Hindus.
   Moslems, who make up 12 percent of the population, fear the
destruction or relocation of the Ayodhya mosque would have a
snowball effect on hundreds of other Moslem sites across the
nation.

<P>
Thousands of Hindu fundamentalists failed in a new attempt today to storm an 
ancient shrine claimed by Muslims, and at least 31 more people died in violence 
sparked by the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
A government minister resigned to protest Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap 
Singh's attempts to block construction of a Hindu temple on the disputed site, 
deepening the crisis in his beleaguered coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Armed paramilitary troops blocked about 5,000 Hindus from attempting to 
re-enter the mosque in Ayodhya, which has been the center of a decades-old 
dispute between India's Hindu majority and Muslim minority. 
</P>
<P>
Hindu fundamentalists broke through police cordons Tuesday and chipped away 
bricks and bits of plaster from the one-story mosque, which they want to 
replace with a temple. 
</P>
<P>
At least five Hindus were killed and 20 injured when police opened fire to 
throw back the rioters. One of the injured died of his wounds today. 
</P>
<P>
Press Trust of India said at least 30 other people were killed in street 
battles between Hindus and Muslims in four widely separated cities. 
</P>
<P>
At least 170 people have been killed in the last eight days, and Singh's 
11-month-old government has been pushed to the verge of collapse. The Hindu 
fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support from the governing 
coalition last month to protest government policy on the temple project. 
</P>
<P>
The desertion left Singh without a majority in Parliament, but he has said he 
will win a vote of confidence scheduled for Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Singh's attempts to ride out the religious and political crisis received 
another setback today when the deputy minister for sports, Bhakta Charan Das, 
resigned to protest the police action at Ayodhya. 
</P>
<P>
Das, a Hindu, accused Singh in his resignation letter of "lack of 
foresightedness" in tackling the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute also triggered violence in neighboring Bangladesh, an Islamic 
nation, where Muslim mobs attacked temples and Hindu shops and homes after 
hearing of the situation in Ayodhya. Authorities clamped curfews on the capital 
Dhaka and the port city of Chittagong to curb rioting. 
</P>
<P>
In Ayodhya, volunteers of the fundamentalist World Hindu Council said they 
would make another attempt to storm the mosque Thursday.

   A bomb hidden in a motor scooter exploded
in a crowded vegetable market in Punjab state today, killing at
least 31 people and wounding 70 others as Hindus celebrated a
religious holiday, police said.
   The bombing, which police blamed on Sikh separatists, raised to
39 the number killed since Monday in the northern state.
   Sikhs campaigning for a separate nation have killed more than
500 people so far this year in Punjab, a rich northern farming
state where they hold a slight majority over Hindus.
   Soon after the blast in Batala, 25 miles north of the Sikh holy
city of Amritsar, Hindu mobs hurled stones at a police station 150
yards from the vegetable market, senior police superintendent S.K.
Goel said.
   Goel was unsure whether any policemen were injured.
   The violence prompted officials to impose an indefinite curfew
on the city, he said, adding that ``the situation is very tense.''
   Most of those killed were Hindus and the wounded included both
Sikhs and Hindus, said Sanjeev Gupta, another senior police
official. Thirty-two of those wounded were in serious condition.
   Goel said the bomb exploded during a march by about 100,000
Hindus celebrating the birth of Rama, a heroic warrior-king. Rama
is extolled in Hindu lore as an incarnation of Vishnu, a member of
the supreme Hindu trinity of gods.
   Witnesses, contacted by telephone, said portions of bodies were
hurled across the market, which was covered with blood-soaked
pieces of vegetables.
   ``Some people were crying for help. Those who were lucky to
survive ran away in panic. Many shops, scooters and one car were
destroyed,'' said one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier today, a bomb exploded on a bus in another town near
Amritsar, killing the driver and one passenger, both Sikhs, senior
police superintendent Anil Sharma said. Police blamed Sikh
extremists for the blast near Taragarh, 17 miles northeast of
Amritsar.
   Sikh Extremists initially targeted only Hindus in their campaign
but now have also turned their guns on Sikhs who don't support the
separatist cause.
   On Monday night, Sikh militants shot and killed four members of
a Sikh family in another part of Punjab, police said.
   At Salghowal, 95 miles southeast of Amritsar, five or six Sikh
gunmen burst into the farmhouse of a Sikh constable Monday night,
killing the policeman, his parents and a younger brother, senior
police superintendent Baramjit Singh said.
   Police also blamed Sikh extremists for an attack on a bus Monday
night in Uttar Pradesh state, which is separated from Punjab by
Haryana state, news agencies reported.
   United News of India said one police guard was killed and 11
passengers were wounded when five gunmen stopped the bus. But a
second police guard killed one of the gunmen and the others fled,
according to United News.
   Press Trust of India said police recovered a Chinese assault
rifle bearing the inscription ``Khalistan Commando Force.''
   Khalistan, which means ``Land of the Pure,'' is the name Sikh
militants use for the independent Sikh nation they want to create
in Punjab.
   The bus was halted while traveling between Bijnore and
Muzaffarnagar, about 75 miles northeast of New Delhi and about 95
miles from the Punjab-Haryana state line.
   Most attacks by Sikh extremists have occurred in Punjab.
Nationwide, Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 million
people, while Hindus account for 82 percent.
   The militants say members of the Sikh faith, which has roots in
both Islam and Hinduism, are discriminated against politically and
culturally by the Hindu majority.
