  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 29 -- Prime Minister [P.M.] Vo Van 
Kiet and Philippine President Fidel Ramos today had an exchange 
of views on the development of the Vietnam-Philippine 
relationship and cooperation. 
  Also present were Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, Minister 
of Agriculture and Food Industry Nguyen Cong Tan, and Trade 
Minister Le Van Triet. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and President Fidel Ramos 
expressed their pleasure at the fine development of the

after the Vietnamese prime minister's visit to the Philippines 
early 1992. 
  P.M. Kiet outlined orientations and measures to further 
promote the Vietnam-Philippine cooperation in the fields of 
commerce, economy, culture, tourism, science and technology on 
the basis of agreements on cooperation signed recently in Hanoi. 
The prime minister said he hoped that Vietnam would receive 
cooperation and assistance from the Philippines in the areas of 
science and technology, personnel training and natural calamity 
preparedness. He said Vietnam was ready to cooperate with the 
Philippines in health care and aquaculture. 
  For his part, President Fidel Ramos spoke highly of the 
progress and growth of the economic, commercial cooperation 
between the two countries in the past, as well as of the 
orientations and measures to develop the two countries' 
long-term cooperation in the future. The Philippine president 
said that with a sense of creating security and stable 
environment in the region, the Philippine Government would 
strive to push up the multi-faceted cooperation for mutual 
benefit with Vietnam, encourage businessmen to invest in 
Vietnam, be prepared to share experiences with Vietnam, and help 
it train economic and technological personnel. 
  P.M. Kiet and President Ramos also compared notes on the 
developments in the region and international issues of common 
concern. The two sides agreed that all outstanding problems 
should be settled in conformity with the interests of the 
region. They also held that only peace and security in the 
region be maintained, can development in each country be ensured. 
  Later, Prime Minister Kiet gave a dinner to President Ramos.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 28 -- Philippine President Fidel V. 
Ramos's official friendship visit to Vietnam expected here today 
is a significant event in the friendly and cooperative relations 
between the two countries, says NHAN DAN in an editorial today. 
  The editorial continues: Vietnam and the Philippines have 
had 
time-honoured culture and trade exchanges. Over the past recent 
years, there have been positive changes in the cooperative 
relations between the two countries. Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet's official visit to the Philippines in 1992 is a great 
landmark in the promotion of mutual understanding and trust, 
creating and impetus to their economic-trade cooperation. The 
two-way trade value increased to nearly USD [U.S. dollars] 50 
million in 1993 from USD 12 million in 1988. The Philippines 
has 11 investment projects in Vietnam with a total capital of 
USD 60 million, ranking 18th among foreign countries investing 
in Vietnam. 'As neighbour, Vietnam and the Philippines have a 
common aspiration for each country's socio-economic progress, 
for peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the 
region. The Philippines and Vietnam have had a common voice in 
seeking peaceful solutions, conforming to their interests as 
well as international laws and pratices, to solve problems left 
behind by the history and foster the friendly and cooperative 
relations between the two countries'. 
  The paper wishes President Ramos's visit a success, thus 
contributing to further promoting the Vietnam-Philippines 
relations for happiness and prosperity of the two nations, and 
for peace, stability, cooperation and development in the region 
and all over the world.

  [Text] Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and his 
Vietnamese counterpart, Mr. Vo Van Kiet, have held an official 
talk in Malaysia. Vietnam prime minister was in Kuala Lumpur to 
attend the 27th International General Conference of the Pacific 
Basin Economic Council. The Voice of Vietnam summarizes the 
talks between the two prime ministers: 
  Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Kiet discussed bilateral multilateral 
relations and international issues of common concern. They 
expressed their satisfaction at the positive developments in the 
friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the two 
countries in the last two years. During this time, the two 
countries have repeatedly exchanged visits of high-level 
delegations. In January 1992, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
visited Malaysia and in April of the same year, Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir officially visited Vietnam. In March 1994, 
Vietnamese Party General Secretary Do Muoi also visited 
Malaysia. The visits have all helped broaden mutual 
understanding, consolidate mutual trust, and promote mutual 
comprehensive cooperation. 
  At present, Malaysia is among six ASEAN countries who have a 
large investment in Vietnam worth about $75 million. Two-way 
trade turnover between the two countries at present is 20 times 
larger than 1985 figure of $20 million. During the talks this 
time in Kuala Lumpur, the two prime ministers discussed concrete 
measures to strengthen cooperation in the production of 
construction materials, industrial construction, and tourism. 
  Concerning the situation in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, 
the two prime ministers expressed their satisfaction at the 
increasing trend for peace and cooperation in the region and 
stated: Nations in the region must join their efforts for 
consolidation of this trend, through which all disputes should 
be solved in the principle of mutual respect and respect for 
internatonal law and practices. 
  Prime Minister Mahathir once again affirmed the support for 
Vietnam's admission to ASEAN as a full member which will benefit 
both Vietnam and Malaysia and cooperation for prosperity in the 
region.

  [Excerpts] Bilateral trade, economic and business ties 
between Malaysia and the Philippines are set to grow at a steady 
pace from now on with the Malaysian prime minister Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed's official four-day visit to the Philippines which began 
on Thursday. 
  The Malaysian leader's visit can be described as historic in 
the sense that it is the first official trip by a Malaysian 
prime minister to the Philippines, since the two countries 
established diplomatic ties in 1964. It also reciprocates the 
visit of Philippine President Fidel Ramos to Malaysia last year. 
[passage omitted] 
  Dr. Mahathir's entourage includes some cabinet ministers 
holding key portfolios as well as about 60 corporate leaders and 
businessmen which demonstrates the seriousness that is being 
attached to increase economic and business cooperation. This 
cooperation entered concrete term on the very first day of the 
visit with the signing of the nine memoranda of understanding or 
MOUs, involving the private sectors of the two countries. 
  The MOUs may lead to deals worth billions of ringgit. Apart 
from injecting much-needed capital into the Philippine economy, 
the deals are also in line with Malaysia's policy to boost 
reverse investment. While the MOUs will be signed, officials of 
the two countries got down to details of an investment guarantee 
agreement, IGA, which is likely to be signed in the course of 
the visit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's 
official visit to the Philippines, the first by a Malaysian 
premier to that country, is already yielding results. The 
Philippine Government is keen and serious about enhancing trade 
relations with Malaysia. And this should be the case with 
[words indistinct] ASEAN. In response to Dr. Mahathir and his 
delegation's visit to the Philippines in February, a 
high-powered multimember delegation from the Philippines paid a 
two-day visit last weekend to the Federal Territory of Labuan 
off the East Malaysian state of Sabah. The Philippine delegation 
was truly interested in knowing more about the development of 
Labuan as an offshore financial center and also about foreign 
investment opportunities in both the East Malaysian states of 
Sabah and Sarawak. What is encouraging is that the visit showed 
the commitment of the Philippine Government to the development 
of the East ASEAN Growth Area. The visiting mission was given a 
detailed briefing on the investment opportunities available in 
Labuan as well as in Sabah and Sarawak. 
  It is noteworthy that the Philippine delegation's visit was 
the first by a well-represented government and private sector 
mission from that country. What seemed to interest them was the 
function of Labuan as an international offshore financial 
center, or IOFC. The delegation included a group of bankers who 
appreciated the IOFC concept being adopted in Labuan. The 
president of the Philippine National Bank has been quoted as 
saying his bank was considering setting up an offshore bank in 
Labuan. The bank would like to finalize joint financial 
undertakings not only with the Malaysian Government but also 
with the private sector. 
  Cooperation between the Philippines and Malaysia is 
certainly 
on the way up. One of Malaysia's leading companies is currently 
involved in the development of infrastructure in the 
Philippines. Malaysian participation in the power supply, stock 
development, and telecommunication sector will also be welcomed 
in the Philippines. [Words indistinct], both countries can help 
each other to promote their respective tourism industry. The 
idea of setting up a regional air link needs serious 
consideration. The visit by the Philippine president, Fidel 
Ramos, to Malaysia last year and the reciprocal visit by Dr. 
Mahathir have opened the way for increased cooperation between 
the two ASEAN partners. The private sector of the two countries 
should take this opportunity to go into joint ventures for their 
mutual benefit.

  [Text] Comprehensive development has taken place in 
relations between Vietnam and the ASEAN member countries. Trade 
and economic ties between Vietnam and ASEAN countries have 
rapidly increased. In 1992, two-way trade between Vietnam and 
the Indonesia reached $220 million. It was $158 million with 
Thailand, $100 million with Malaysia, $1.2 billion with 
Singapore, and $50 million with the Philippines. 
  By the end of 1993, about 100 projects for ASEAN countries 
with invested capital of hundreds of millions of dollar were 
licensed in Vietnam. ASEAN investment in Vietnam has increased 
10 times as against 1990, now accounting for 10 percent of the 
total foreign investment in Vietnam. More than 30 agreements on 
economic, scientific and technical, trade, payment, credit, 
aviation, and navigation have been signed between ASEAN 
countries and Vietnam. 
  In late July last year, the State Committee for Foreign 
Investment of Vietnam signed an agreement of cooperation with a 
prime company of Brunei which will see the latter invests in 
major projects in Vietnam. In late 1991 and early 1992, the 
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited all six ASEAN 
member countries. This helped the region to have a better 
understanding about the current reform in this country. 
  In visiting Vietnam, all leaders of ASEAN member countries 
demonstrated sympathy with the problems and difficulties Vietnam 
has been confronting, and promised to share experiences with the 
Vietnamese in national development. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai of Thailand is committed to 
create favorable conditions for further multi-sided cooperation 
between Vietnam and his country. President Fidel Ramos of the 
Philippines has assured Vietnamese National Assembly chairman 
Nong Duc Manh that the Philippines has always been Vietnam's 
friend, and hoped that bilateral ties would be further 
developed. It is the common voice of leaders and people of 
ASEAN member countries. 
  Most recently, during his visit to Vietnam, the ASEAN 
secretary general, Mr. Ajit Singh, informed Vietnam of the 
decision by ASEAN Secretariat to allow Vietnam to participate 
and observe in various programs in science, technology, 
environment, culture, information, public health, tourism, and 
development sources. Mr. Ajit Singh said the secretariat will 
send senior officials to Vietnam to exchange views on concrete 
issues of ASEAN's concern. 
  These developments show how much bilateral and multi-sided 
cooperation between Vietnam and ASEAN member countries has been 
increasing. At the recent foreign ministerial conference held 
in Singapore by ASEAN, ASEAN countries appreciated Vietnam's 
achievements in its renovation process, and welcomed Vietnam's 
participation in a forum on regional security. Relations 
between Vietnam and ASEAN has created a new atmosphere in 
Southeast Asia. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed once declared that 
he would be glad to contribute to national reconstruction and 
economic development in Indochina, with the confidence that 
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia would be stable and developed. It 
would contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the 
region.

  [Text] Manila, Thurs. -- Economic cooperation between 
Malaysia and the Philippines entered more concrete terms today 
with the signing of nine memorandums of understanding (MOUs) 
involving the respective private sectors. 
  While representatives from the various companies worked on 
the details of the projects involved, officials from the two 
governments sat down to finalise details of an investment 
guarantee agreement (IGA), which may be signed in the next few 
days. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and 
President Fidel Ramos witnessed the signing ceremonies at the 
Malacanang Palace, the latter's official residence, here this 
afternoon. 
  Dr. Mahathir, who arrived here this afternoon for a four-day 
visit, the first by a Malaysian prime minister since the two 
countries established diplomatic ties in 1964, hailed the 
signing of the agreements as "the start of a new phase in our 
relations." "I think we have made very good progress," he told a 
joint news conference after the signings. Asked if more 
investments from Malaysia could be expected, he replied: "Yes." 
  The nine MOUs could lead to deals worth billions of ringgit. 
Apart from injecting much-needed capital into the growing 
Philippine economy, which rose by 2.3 percent last year compared 
with one per cent in 1992, the deals are also in line with 
Malaysia's policy to boost reverse investment. The MOUs, signed 
behind closed doors, are for a hotel project on Samal Island in 
Mindanao; partial acquisition of the Associated Bank; highway 
and mass transit systems construction and the implementation of 
a RM [Malaysian ringgit] 50-million waterwork project; water 
treatment for Clark Base; gaming houses; production of 
refrigerators, the construction of Metro Manila waterworks 
sewerage system; and a U.S. $72-million power plant. 
  The nine MOUs were signed between Johan Holdings Bhd. 
[Limited]/George Kent and Metropolitan Cebu Water District; 
Johan Holdings Bhd./George Kent and Bases Conversion Development 
Authority Berjaya Topgroup (HK) Ltd. and Team Asia Corp Inc.; 
Berjaya/Wy Sdn. Bhd. [Private Limited] and Fun Characters Inc.; 
Ekran Bhd. and the Philippine Department of Tourism/Philippine 
Tourism Authority; Ekran Bhd. and Associated Bank; Renong 
Bhd./Mara and Public Estates Authority; and Datuk Eugene Campos 
and Louis Cosan. 
  The signing of the MOUs reflects the determination of both 
countries to step up investment and bilateral trade after ties 
had been held back for so long by the Philippine Government's 
claim over Sabah. Malaysia's investment in the Philippines has 
been unpredictable. On an uptrend during the 1980s, investments 
dipped after 1989 and in 1992, no new capital from Malaysia 
flowed into the Philippines. 
  Last year some 193 million pesos (RM16.3 million) in 
Malaysian investments went into power generation plants, poultry 
breeding, and electronic manufacturing projects in the republic. 
  MBf Asia Capital Corp. and MCA Power Corp., together with a 
third Canadian partner, entered into a deal for a U.S. $2 
billion (RM5.5 billion) power plant irrigation and flood control 
system. Hong Leong Engineering and Sarte Teodore and Associates 
clinched a deal on the manufacturing of computer software in the 
Philippines for export. 
  Al-Bakara Malaysia also took a slice of the pie in a deal 
with a group, led by Mindanao's Mastura family to rehabilitate 
the state- owned Amanah Bank, now privatised.

  [Text] A call by Philippine President Fidel Ramos for more 
contacts among claimants of the disputed Spratly Islands in the 
South China Sea which will eventually lead to "demilitarisation" 
of the area drew a receptive response from Vietnam, a senior 
Philippine government official said here yesterday. 
  President Ramos arrived in Hanoi on Monday for a three-day 
official visit. He held talks with Vietnamese President Le Duc 
Anh, Communist Party chief Do Muoi and Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet. 
  The Philippines and Vietnam are among six claimants of the 
Spratly Islands. With the exception of Brunei, the two 
countries along with China, Taiwan and Malaysia, have maintained 
various degrees of military presence in the area. 
  Speaking at a press conference before heading for southern 
Ho 
Chi Minh City yesterday Ramos said his proposal for more 
contacts as well as for joint resources development in the 
Spratlys is aimed at defusing tension in the region. 
  "We agreed on the need to devise confidence-building 
mechanisms -- cooperative ventures in the area -- that will 
assure the claimant countries and the rest of the region that 
the South China Sea can be transformed from waters of contention 
to an area of cooperation," he said. 
  Ramos added that he also mentioned to the Vietnamese leaders 
"the need to agree on demilitarisation" of the Spratlys. 
  Elaborating on his president's remarks, Undersecretary for 
Foreign Affairs Rodolfo Severino told reporters that 
demilitarisation of the Spratlys should be achieved in an Asian 
way, which is "gradual, step by step, in a consensual manner." 
  The Philippine and Vietnamese leaders also said they would 
like to encourage informal contacts from top level down to local 
commanders among the claimant parties, with a view to reducing 
tension in dealing with the Spratlys, according to Severino. 
  Vietnam has constantly reiterated its sovereignty over the 
Spratlys and the Paracels in which the latter is also in 
bilateral contention with China. 
  Stressing that the proposal for joint studies towards 
military reduction and joint resource development is new to 
Vietnam, Severino said Vietnam nevertheless found this "an 
interesting" idea. 
  The ASEAN Regional Forum, to be held this July in Bangkok 
and 
to which Vietnam is invited to attend, will steer clear from 
controversial issues such as disputed claims over the Spratlys, 
he said. 
  While in Hanoi, President Ramos also presided over the 
signing of several bilateral agreements covering trade, culture, 
tourism and the set-up of a Joint Commission for Bilateral 
Cooperation. 
  The two countries said they would try to increase bilateral 
trade, which last year amounted to only US$48 million, 
facilitate Vietnamese rice for Philippine fertiliser barter 
arrangements, as well as work to establish direct shipping 
services.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Time Has Come To Admit Vietnam Into ASEAN"] </F>
  [Text] The honor guard at Hanoi's international airport has 
probably never been so busy. Since Washington lifted its 
three-decade-old economic embargo on Vietnam in February, the 
formerly shunned communist bastion has been besieged by 
diplomatic visitors. 
  Leading the rush, have been the heads of the Association of 
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), all eager to look at 
investment prospects and assess Hanoi's ambitions to join their 
privileged group. Within the space of a little over a month, 
Vietnam has hosted visits from the secretary general of ASEAN 
and the leaders of Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. 
  Communist Party chief Du Muoi was a guest of Malaysia last 
week, and President Le Duc Anh is due to visit Indonesia in late 
April. The visits coincide with a diplomatic offensive on the 
part of Vietnam, which is trying to widen ties with ASEAN and 
pave the way for its own entry into the group. 
  The official exchanges mark the second major diplomatic 
offensive Vietnam has launched following the break up of the 
Soviet bloc. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited all six ASEAN 
members between October 1991 and July 1992 as Vietnam searched 
for new economic partners. At the time, most observers 
predicted that it would be at least five years before Vietnam 
would be admitted. But in a reflection of the sweeping 
political changes that are occurring across the region, 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced in Hanoi that 
he thought Vietnam may be formally discussed in 18 months. 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos was even more optimistic, 
calling for the immediate acceptance of Vietnam. 
  Political differences between communist Vietnam and the six 
capitalist ASEAN members have been swept aside with Hanoi's 
market reforms and the signing of the Cambodia peace agreement 
in 1991. 
  Goh said Vietnam's communist ideology was no obstacle to 
membership of the bloc, founded when most of its members were 
aligned against Hanoi during the Vietnam War. 
  "It (Vietnam's communism) should not be an obstacle," he 
said. "It depends on whether it can contribute to ASEAN." 
  Vietnam contends that its political system is not going to 
change anytime soon and that the important thing is stability 
for economic development, a line that fits in nicely with the 
way most ASEAN governments feel about the "soft autocratic" 
style of democracy they practice. 
  Other ASEAN officials have argued that the speed at which 
Vietnam is integrated will depend on the pace of its economic 
development and market reforms While Vietnam is about 30 to 40 
years behind Singapore and possibly some 20 years behind in 
development compared to the Philippines or Indonesia, the wide 
disparity within ASEAN itself would suggest that this is not an 
obstacle. 
  However, ASEAN officials have said that before membership 
can 
be granted, Hanoi must prove its ability to contribute to the 
group's technical projects and resolve administrative and 
financial obstacles. These include the need to boost English 
language skills and accounting practices. 
  Once again it seems ASEAN's ability to zero in on petty 
bureaucratic priorities when faced with the opportunity of 
taking bold action will only reinforce its reputation as a 
hide-bound forum for endless talk and little achievement. 
  Hanoi is upgrading its technical capabilities to accelerate 
its admission but ASEAN continues to talk of admitting Vietnam 
only at an "appropriate time" when it is sure it can make a 
contribution to the regional group. 
  In one frequently cited area, education, it is going to be 
years if not decades before Vietnam can contribute but in 
possibly the most important area -- security -- Vietnam is ready 
to make a valuable contribution now. 
  As Philippines President Fidel Ramos, Hanoi's only strong 
supporter in the regional grouping noted, Vietnam's 
"incorporation into ASEAN is an imperative of Southeast Asian 
peace, security and prosperity." 
  "Over the next generation, Vietnam is certain to become one 
of Southeast Asia's most important states and a major force in 
the balance of power," Ramos said during his recent visit to 
Hanoi. 
  Of particular interest to Ramos and the Philippines is the 
dispute Spratly Islands. ASEAN has been reluctant to take an 
assertive stand on the atolls which are claimed in part by four 
of its members, as well as Vietnam, Taiwan and China and have 
long been regarded as the most likely source of conflict in the 
region. 
  In 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty in which the 
original ASEAN members pledged to settle their disputes 
peacefully. China refuses to sign the treaty and its use of 
force against Vietnam to settle claims in the South China Sea is 
becoming increasingly troubling. 
  ASEAN was born out of fear of the spread of communism and 
conflict from Vietnam. Whether it is a member of ASEAN or not, 
Vietnam remains crucial to continued peace and prosperity in the 
region. 
  By admitting Vietnam, ASEAN will be better placed to work 
toward a solution of the Spratly Islands issue and also prosper 
if the South China Sea can in the words of Ramos, "be 
transformed from waters of contention to an area of cooperation." 
  As ASEAN admits itself, Vietnam's membership is no longer a 
matter of policy or principle but merely procedure and time -- 
an that time has come.

  [Text] President Fidel Ramos today said that his meeting 
with top Vietnamese leaders have greatly enhanced 
Philippine-Vietnamese relations, which he describes as a 
critical factor for the solidarity of Southeast Asia and the 
peace and progress of the region. The president said he had 
friendly and powerful meetings with President Le Duc Anh, 
General Secretary Do Muoi of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and 
Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh. The chief executive said he was 
looking forward for his luncheon meeting with the prime 
minister, Vo Van Kiet. 
  President Ramos said Vietnam's leaders are all acutely aware 
of their country's need for regional stability so that they can 
have a breathing spell after two generations of almost 
continuous conflict to set their economy on the road to 
self-sustaining growth. 
  The president said that during his meetings with the 
Vietnamese leaders, he was able to explore new avenues of 
possible cooperation in the South China sea in order to reduce 
tension in the area and promote its joint development as called 
for in the 1992 Manila Declaration on South China Sea. The two 
countries also agreed on the needs to devise confidence-building 
mechanisms or cooperative ventures that will begin to assure 
countries with claims over the area in the rest of the region 
that the South China Sea can transform from waters of contention 
to an area of cooperation. 
  On the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees still in the 
Philippines, the president said, and I [newscaster] quote, We 
agreed that the increasingly favorable economic situation in 
Vietnam should make it easier for our two countries to work out 
the repatriation of the Vietnamese asylum seekers in the 
Philippines, unquote. 
  President Ramos paid tribute to Vietnam's revolutionary 
leader Ho Chi Minh by laying a wreath at his mausoleum at the Ba 
Dinh Square. The president and his official delegation arrived 
at 8:00 A.M. yesterday and briskly walked towards the mausoleum 
escorted by the curator and a guard. After laying the wreath, 
the president proceeded to the Ho Chi Minh residence, located 
inside the compound of the Presidential Palace. The two-room 
house is made of wooden materials. The president accompanied by 
the caretakers stopped by the pond and attempted to fish out but 
failed to catch any. After this, Representative Antonio Cuenco 
told reporters that the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organization 
[AIPO] will invite Vietnam to attend the forthcoming AIPO 
meeting in Manila in September. The invitation will be relayed 
today by the Philippine legislators accompanying President Ramos 
during his official visit in Hanoi. Representative Cuenco said 
that during the AIPO meeting in Manila Vietnam will be offered 
an associate member status, which will make it a dialogue 
partner. Vietnam currently has an observer status in the AIPO. 
  President Ramos visited the assembly plant of Vietnam Motors 
Corp., a joint venture of Filipino and Vietnamese businessmen. 
In extemporaneous remarks during his visit to the plant site, 
the president said the linking up of the two countries in the 
joint economic endeavor is a breakthrough in business 
partnership. He said this partnership is a new arithmetic in 
business in the global economy. The president said that so far 
$7 billion worth of spare parts have been imported from the 
Philippines for the plant, which assembles 9,200 Mazda and [word 
indistinct] vehicles a year. The plant employs a number of 
Filipino managers and technicians. Vietnam Motors Corp. is a 
joint venture between Colombia Motors Group of the Philippines 
and Hoa Binh Automotive factory of Vietnam. Colombia has 70 
percent equity in the firm. The plant started operations in 
1992. 
  President Ramos, recalling that the Philippines and Vietnam 
made solemn commitments to respect each other's territorial and 
sovereign integrity in 1978 and in 1992, last night proposed the 
holding of regular consultations among all states with claims on 
the Spratlys. According to the president, in the South China 
Sea, where both the countries are involved, attention needs to 
be focused not on mutual suspicions but on cooperative ventures 
that build mutual confidence and trust among the claimant 
states. The president said regular consultations on the 
Spratlys can result in greater cooperation in local confidence 
building, marine research, environmental protection and joint 
exploratory activities. 
  According to President Ramos the foundation for the 
friendship between the two countries were laid when they 
established diplomatic relations soon after the reunification of 
Vietnam. The commitments that they made to each other were 
given substance and strength by a joint communique issued in 
1978 by then President Marcos and then Premier Pham Van Dong, 
and they were reaffirmed by Prime minister Vo Van Kiet and 
President Aquino in Manila in 1992. 
  According to President Ramos, and I quote, By this solemn 
undertaking, we pledge peace between us, resolving to settle 
peacefully any disputes and to cooperate for the common good for 
our people. This pledge I reaffirm, Mr. President, on behalf of 
my government and the Filipino people, unquote. 
  The chief executive said Manila was privileged to be the 
host 
two years ago of Vietnam's accession to the Treaty of Amity and 
Cooperation in Southeast Asia and Vietnam's acceptance as 
observer in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It was 
during the same occasion in Manila that ASEAN issued the Manila 
Declaration of the South China Sea, which Vietnam immediately 
endorsed. President Ramos noted that his delegation also looked 
intensively into the opportunities for counter trade and 
investments and joint ventures in each other's economy. The 
chief executive also offered the help of the Philippine 
industrialists, academics, managers and technologist in 
rebuilding Vietnam's infrastructure and financial management and 
legislative policy formulation, and in running their tourist 
facilities. 
  According to the president, they also agreed during their 
meeting to collaborate in science and technology, education, and 
public health. The two countries also agreed to exert every 
effort to raise the level of trade and to take every advantage 
of complimentarity, adding that the trade protocol signed 
yesterday identified a long list of products that could 
profitably be exchanged between the two countries. According to 
President Ramos and I quote, We proposed and they agreed that we 
establish a joint commission to deal comprehensively with the 
whole range of our relationship and nurture its steady 
expansion, unquote. To promote tourism in both countries, 
President Ramos cited the just concluded tourism and cultural 
agreement between the Philippines and the Vietnamese officials.

  [Text] Leading Malaysian journalist has criticized what he 
called the highhandedness of his country's enforcement agencies 
dealing with immigrants. Kadir Jasin, editor of Malaysia's 
influential NEW STRAITS TIMES, was referring in its Sunday 
weekly column to the roundup by Malaysian police on Palm Sunday 
of more than 1,000 Filipino maids in front of a Catholic church 
in Kuala Lumpur. In his column, Kadir said he did not think 
many Malaysians were pleased by the highhandedness by 
enforcement agencies in the operations against foreigners. 
  In the operations, 711 Filipino maids were detained. All but 
33 of them were later released after their employers produced 
their work permits. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin 
Mohamed directed authorities, including the police, to exercise 
greater care when carrying raids of suspected illegal workers in 
places of worship. As this developed, Prime Minister Mahathir 
is reported sending to Manila a personal emissary to meet with 
President Ramos on the Palm Sunday arrest. 
  Meantime, Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto 
Romulo 
says the Philippine Government has reached what he called a 
meeting of the minds with Malaysia on how to cool down the 
dispute. Romulo said he and the Malaysian Foreign Minister 
Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi have agreed to discuss the matter 
in a joint commission set up last year. That commission carries 
the task of improving bilateral relations chilled by a 
30-year-old Philippine claim of Malaysia's Sabah State. 
  Speaking of Sabah, President Ramos has evaded making a 
direct 
response to a proposal raised in Congress for the revival of the 
country's claim to Sabah. Speaking to reporters in Cebu in the 
Visayas, the president said Malacanang [presidential office] 
will issue a statement today on its position on the proposal. 
Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo presented a proposal the other 
day asking President Ramos to again assert the Philippines' 
territorial claim of Sabah. Arroyo made the proposal shortly 
after Senator Ernesto Herrera suggested that the Philippine 
Government withdraws its invitation to Malaysia's ceremonial 
king to visit Manila beginning this Thursday to Saturday.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Feb 25 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
received here this morning a delegation of the Cuban National 
Bank led by its First Vice President Osvaldo F. Torres, now on a 
working visit to Vietnam. While here, the delegation paid a 
floral tribute to the late President Ho Chi Minh at his 
mausoleum. It has working sessions with officials of the State 
Bank and the Commercial Bank of Vietnam during which the two 
sides affirmed their determination to continue broadening their 
cooperation and exchanging experience in the field of banking 
activities in each country in order to effectively implement the 
agreements between the two countries signed during Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to Cuba last year. Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet hailed the results of the two sides' working 
sessions as a new manifestation of the friendly and cooperative 
relations between the fraternal and reliable peoples of Cuba and 
Vietnam. He said the friendship, cooperation and mutual 
assistance between the two countries were elements of important 
significance to the national construction and defence of each 
country in that cause and would learn much from Cuba's valuable 
experience. 
  Vice President O.F. Torres highly appreciated the 
achievements recorded by the Vietnamese people in the renovation 
process which he said would be an encouragement to the Cuban 
people in its struggle to overcome immediate difficulties and 
firmly safeguard its revolutionary gains in a new stage. 
  Yesterday afternoon, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet also 
received 
an Austrian trade mission led by Leopold Maderthaner, president 
of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber, and representatives of 
45 Austrian major companies who arrived here on Feb. 23. While 
here, the Austrian mission compared notes with Doan Duy Thanh, 
president of the Vietnam Commerce and Industry Chamber, and 
other ministries and branches concerned on possibilities of 
expansion of economic and commercial cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  At this reception, Mr Maderthaner stressed that the 
cooperation development between Austria and Vietnam was in the 
right direction. Besides expanding trade ties, his country would 
assist and cooperate with Vietnam in manufacture of machines in 
service of agriculture and water resources, equipment for water 
supply, and training personnel for economic management. 
  Mr. Maderthaner informed Prime Minister Kiet of his 
government's decision to sponsor a seminar on economy to be held 
in Vietnam and to finance a feasibility study in manufacturing 
machines. Speaking to his guests, the Vietnamese prime minister 
said that Vietnam welcomes and is ready to create favourable 
conditions for Austrian businessmen to come to inquire into 
possibilities and carry out investment projects in the interest 
of the two countries. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet expressed his 
hope that Austria would be a reliable partner of Vietnam in 
economic, trade cooperation and investment in future.

  [Text] Filipino President Fidel Ramos has described his 
tour of Vietnam as one of the most significant visits he has 
ever made. He told the media on Tuesday before leaving Hanoi 
that the Philippines, together with Vietnam and other countries 
in Southeast Asia, wish to share a common destiny and there is 
no other alternatives than promotion of economic cooperation and 
construction of peace among them. The president supported 
Vietnam's succession to ASEAN. He expressed readiness to share 
his country's experience to build infrastructure and a legal 
system in Vietnam. He maintained that the two countries have 
large opportunities in scientific, technological, educational, 
and health cooperation. 
  Before leaving Hanoi, President Fidel Ramos held a press 
conference. 
  [Begin Ramos recording in English] I have, like other heads 
of government in other parts of the world, been covering [words 
indistinct]. In an effort to develop [word indistinct] 
activities in our foreign relations, [word indistinct] the 
Philippines cannot [word indistinct] with the vigorous economies 
of Southeast Asia. I regard this trip to the Socialist Republic 
of Vietnam as a one of the most significant I have made. With 
Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states, the Philippines 
has a shared destiny. There is no alternative for peace than 
economic cooperation among us in this region that we are 
inhabit. In Manila in 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty 
of the ASEAN nations which binds signatories to settle regional 
disputes peaceably. Vietnam's full membership in ASEAN is now a 
matter [words indistinct] in principle but mainly of time and 
procedure. I reiterated to Vietnam's leaders the consistent 
support of the Philippines to help facilitate Vietnam's entry 
into ASEAN. They in turn informed me of their intensive 
preparations for full participation in ASEAN activities. 
  Philippine-Vietnamese relations are a critical factor for 
the 
solidarity of Southeast Asia and consequently for the peace and 
progress of the region. I believe my visit greatly enhances 
these relations. I had friendly and fruitful meetings with 
President Le Duc Anh, General Secretary Do Muoi of the Communist 
Party of Vietnam, and Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh; and I look 
forward to our meeting with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet later 
today. 
  Like our own leadership, Vietnam's leaders are all acutely 
aware of their country's need for regional stability so that 
they can have the breathing spell after four generations of 
almost continuous conflict to shape their economy and [word 
indistinct] self- sustaining role. With them I explored avenues 
of possible cooperation among the claimants to areas of the 
South China Sea and other nations of Southeast Asia in order to 
reduce tensions in the area and to promote joint development as 
called for in the 1994 Manila Declaration. We agreed on the 
need to devise confidence building mechanisms, cooperative 
ventures in the area that will begin to assure the claimant 
countries of the archipelagoes that the South China Sea can be 
transformed from waters of contention into an area of 
cooperation. We agreed that the increasingly favorable economic 
situation in Vietnam should make it easier for our two countries 
to work out the repatriation of the Vietnamese asylum seekers in 
the Philippines. My delegation also looked intensively into the 
opportunities for countertrade and into investments and joint 
ventures in each other's economies. 
  We offered the help of our industrialists, academics, 
managers, and technologists in the building of Vietnam's 
infrastructure, in financial management, in legislative policy 
formulation, and in running the tourist facilities. We agreed 
there is great room for our two countries to collaborate in 
science and technology, education, and public health. And we 
agreed to exert every effort to raise the level of trade between 
us and to make and to take every advantage of complimentarities 
between our two economies. [end recording]

technology, healthcare, personnel training, and so on. Mr.

France had got export surplus, that was why to keep the 
import-export balance, it was necessary to encourage French 
businessmen to further invest in Vietnam so that many products 
could be made and exported to France and other countries in the 
Asia-Pacific region. The minister affirmed that Vietnam could 
enjoy France's support to develop its cooperation with EC 
countries, France will invest in and transfer technology to 
Vietnam with a view to helping it turn out programme on 
infrastructure construction in Vietnam, the French minister 
said. For his part, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet expressed his 
satisfaction at the new steps of development in the two 
countries' friendly and cooperative relations following the 
visit to Vietnam of the French president early last year. The 
prime minister said that both countries have basis and 
advantages to bring their cooperation for mutual benefit to a 
new stage. He also expressed his wish that after Mr. Longuet's 
visit the friendship and cooperation between the two countries 
would be developed in all fields and with higher effectiveness, 
especially in the economic-trade and investment fields.

  [Text] The Commission for External Relations of the 
Vietnamese Communist Party Central Committee has announced that 
party leader Do Muoi will soon visit Malaysia. This is the 
first visit to Malaysia by the Vietnamese highest leader. 
Following is our radio opinion on the visit and relations 
between Vietnam and Malaysia. 
  Last year, Party Leader Do Muoi visited Singapore and 
Thailand. This year, he is preparing to visit Malaysia. 
Vietnamese State President Le Duc Anh will visit Indonesia 
early next month. 
  In the last two years, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited 
most countries in the region. Vietnam does respect its 
relations with other regional countries, especially with the 
ASEAN member countries. Furthermore, all countries in Southeast 
Asia have acknowledged the cooperation for mutual benefit with 
Vietnam. The British Broadcasting Corporation radio on March 17 
quoted Mr. Chew Tai Soo, the Singaporean ambassador to the 
United Nations, as saying that Vietnam was on the threshold of 
ASEAN. Vietnam should join ASEAN and the visit to Malaysia by 
party leader Do Muoi will contribute to promoting this process. 
  The visit will also strengthen relations between Vietnam and 
Malaysia, which have achieved progress after the visit to 
Malaysia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in 1992. Two-way trade 
turnover has reached $100 million. Malaysia has invested in 16 
projects in Vietnam worth $95 million. Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamed himself has a deep sentiment towards Vietnam 
and respects bilateral relations between Vietnam and Malaysia. 
  The visit to Malaysia by our party leader will contribute to 
implementing the desire of leaders and peoples of the two 
countries to consolidate and develop friendship and cooperation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Better and Better in ASEAN"] </F>
  [Excerpts] When President Fidel Ramos visited Malaysia last 
year, he was the first Philippine leader to do so after 25 
years. Last week, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed returned the 
courtesy. Not since Tunku Abdul Rahman had a Malaysian prime 
minister been there on an official visit in 30 years. Such 
reserve showed in the modest trade links: the two countries did 
no more than [Singapore dollar] $555 million worth of business 
in the first nine months of last year. [passage omitted] Talking 
to Filipinos in Manila, one gets the feeling that more than a 
few do not share an ASEAN destiny. It is not insularity, but an 
apartness built on the country's Spanish-American past and 
Christian outlook. That is changing, however. 
  Improved relations with Malaysia are a key element of that 
process. This impinges on ASEAN cohesion, as the number of 
territorial disputes, apart from the one on Sabah, are a 
constant reminder that good neighbourliness cannot be taken for 
granted. The Spratlys dispute concerns three ASEAN nations; 
Malaysia and Indonesia have not settled the issue of Sipadan and 
Ligitan; while Malaysia has not given up its claim on Pedra 
Branca. Sabah, lest it be forgotten, is not a closed file. 
There are complexities which will take much negotiation and 
goodwill to disentangle. Neither Dr. Mahathir nor Mr. Ramos 
pretend that a settlement can be had in their lifetime. [passage 
omitted] What bodes will for ASEAN is that after three decades, 
Malaysia and the Philippines accept that, one, the Sabah 
resolution need not be tied to a time-frame, and two, that 
economic co-operation should not be held hostage to it. The 
Sabah question, as agreed upon before Dr. Mahathir went to 
Manila, is now held in suspended animation. [passage omitted] 
  What is "positive" was what the Mahathir visit was about: 
trade and investment links. If there is sustained economic 
expansion, no political problem can remain intractable for long. 
It was significant that on the Malaysian side, the initiative 
came from the private sector which was a big part of the 
Mahathir party. The nine memoranda of understanding signed with 
Philippine interests cover infrastructure work that the 
Filipinos need badly to ignite growth: highways, hotels, power 
and water plants, rail systems. Intriguing was the Malaysian 
offer of a financing instrument called the Bilateral Payments 
Arrangement (BPA) to boost trade. Under this system originally 
meant for the Group of 15 developing countries, importers and 
exporters are guaranteed payment through the central banks of 
trading partners. Malaysia has BPA links with 21 countries with 
trade amounting to [Malaysian dollar] $4 billion. It will be a 
help to the Philippines. Less clear is the concept of an East 
Asian growth crescent covering Mindanao, Brunei, the East 
Malaysian states, and eastern Indonesia. If it takes off it 
will energise development on a big scale, on a par with the 
ASEAN free trade area scheme. The framework and growth 
mechanisms will take time to evolve. Conditions are favourable, 
however, such as the greatly reduced threat from the Muslim 
separatists and jungle guerillas in the Philippines. This may 
be Manila's biggest contribution to ASEAN and to itself.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel Ramos prior his departure for </F>
Vietnam at Ninoy International Airport in Manila on 28 March -- 
recorded; passages within slantlines in Tagalog] 
  [Text] At the gracious invitation of President Le Duc Anh 
of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, I leave today on a 
three-day official visit to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with a 
small official delegation. Accompanying us are four members of 
my cabinet, three senators and two congressmen, the president of 
the University of the Philippines, and a business delegation of 
our most prominent industrialists and traders. 
  This trip reciprocates Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to 
our country three years ago. I regard this visit as one of the 
most significant I have made. Vietnam is one of our closest 
neighbors. It is less than two hours away across the South 
China Sea. Our two countries are alike in terrain, area, 
natural resources, and population. Our cultural connections 
date back at least a thousand years, and our struggles against 
colonialism and foreign conquest were inspired by the same 
ideals of freedom and national independence. But in the course 
of history, we adopted different ideological systems for 
organizing our national societies. The Cold War and the 
Indo-China [words indistinct] raised even greater barriers 
between our two countries. Today, mutual goodwill between our 
two countries have brought down those barriers. Our paths 
converge again on the road to self-sustaining economic growth, 
and our two countries today seek national security and regional 
stability, neither in military alliances nor in accumulating 
weapons but in friendly consultation and economic cooperation 
with neighbor countries. 
  With Vietnam and the other Southeast Asian states, our 
country has a shared destiny. We have found that there is no 
alternative to peace and economic cooperation among us in this 
region. Over the next generation, Vietnam is certain to become 
one of Southeast Asia's most important states and a major force 
in the regional balance of power. Its incorporation in the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, is an imperative 
of Southeast Asian peace, security, and prosperity. In Manila 
in July 1992, Vietnam acceded to the Bali Treaty of the ASEAN 
States, which binds iis signatories to settle regional disputes 
peaceably. Vietnam's full membership in ASEAN is now a matter 
no longer of policy or principle, but merely of time and 
procedure. Even now, Vietnam already takes part in a wide range 
of ASEAN cooperative activities. For instance, it is a part of 
the ASEAN Regional Forum, to which ASEAN and friendly outside 
powers consult on regional security. 
  The Philippines took the initiative of wholeheartedly 
supporting Vietnam's membership in ASEAN and its associated 
institutions. We have also consistently supported Vietnam's 
efforts to re-establish normal relations with the global 
community and to secure membership in international financial 
and political organizations. Philippine-Vietnamese relations 
are a critical force for the solidarity of Southeast Asia and 
consequently for peace and progress of the Asia- Pacific region. 
I am confident that this visit, the first by a Philippine 
president to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, will advance 
this relations substantially. 
  The facets of our bilateral relationships are many and 
increasing. There are, therefore, important things for my 
delegation to discuss with Vietnam's leaders. There is the 
security of East Asia and the Pacific. Its present status can 
now be enhanced cooperatively by the nations of the region. I 
shall be exploring avenues of possible cooperation between our 
two countries in seeking a breakthrough to the multiple 
competing claims to the Spratlys archipelago in the South China 
Sea. Perhaps a joint venture in marine research of the islands 
related to ocean research, weather forecasting, and 
environmental protection, and participated by all the claimants, 
for a start of the confidence-building mechanisms that we need 
to settle these claims for our mutual benefit. [sentence as 
heard] There are other creative proposals that I intend to 
discuss with our Vietnamese neighbors. Then, there is the new 
thrust in economic cooperation which ASEAN has undertaken. 
Through the ASEAN Free Trade Area or AFTA, to which a talented 
and hardworking Vietnamese people have a great deal to 
contribute. 
  I look forward to inform the leaders of Vietnam of the 
political consolidation and economic reforms that we are 
undertaking in our country and the results these measures have 
so far achieved in our overall effort to open our economy to 
market forces and to global competition. In turn, I hope to 
learn from them the workings of their own economic renovation or 
doi moi which has made Vietnam one of the fastest growing 
economies in the world this past seven years. The lifting of 
the American trade embargo last month and the American 
investment it is expected to bring should both speed up the pace 
and broaden the scope of its economic growth. The increasingly 
favorable economic situation in Vietnam should also make it 
easier for our two countries to find a durable solution for the 
problem of Vietnamese asylumseekers in the Philippines. 
  Great potentials for economic cooperation between our two 
countries are opening up. My delegation will look into 
possibilities of counter trade, investments, complimentation, 
and joint-ventures in each other's economies. We shall offer 
the Vietnamese the help of our industrialists, managers, and 
technologists in rebuilding their infrastructure and 
telecommunications systems, planning their new cities, and 
managing their tourist facilities. There should also be great 
room for collaboration between us in education, language 
training, and training of technical people. We shall be 
proposing the activation of our joint commission on trade and 
economic cooperation. 
  The business leaders in my delegation intend to identify 
with 
their Vietnamese counterparts specific products that we can 
profitably exchange in the light of the present low level trade 
between our two countries and of the prospects offered by the 
growth and diversification of our respective economies. There 
are opportunities also in agriculture and in agricultural 
research. Like our country, Vietnam is a major producer and 
exporter of agricultural products. We can operate also in 
promoting tourism, both from our neighbors and from outside the 
region. There is also much room for collaboration in science and 
technology, in education, and public health. We have much to 
learn from each other. 
  I expect to discuss these prospects with President Le Duc 
Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, General Secretary Do Muoi of 
the ruling party and the country's other policymakers and its 
private sector. Finally, I look forward to visiting with a small 
but growing community of Filipino businessmen and professionals 
in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. 
  This, then is a historic visit to a very important neighbor, 
a neighbor destined to become even closer to us bilaterally and 
in ASEAN. My dear countrymen, we leave our beloved Philippines 
in a good situation and in good hands. I ask you to pray to the 
Almighty for the success of our mission and for our safe return 
two days from now. Long live the Philippines. Thank you 
very much to all of you.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA March 26 -- Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamed gave a dinner in Kuala Lumpur yesterday evening 
in honour of Vietnam's party General Secretary Do Muoi now on an 
official friendship visit to Malaysia. 
  At the dinner, the Vietnamese party leader said: 
  We have had very profound impressions of Malaysia and its 
people. A few decades ago, Malaysia was known merely as one of 
the world's largest producers of rubber and tin. Today, it is a 
country with an advanced manufacturing industry and is striving 
to become an industrialized nation according to plan `Vision 
2020'. We are also deeply impressed by the fact that the 
economic development here has been closely linked with the 
promotion of the rich national culture in an atmosphere of 
harmony among different ethnic groups of a unified community. 
Malaysia has also been known for its initiatives for peace and 
cooperation among nations, especially among the regional and 
developing countries. 
  Allow us to share the pride of the people of Malaysia in 
their great achievements in national construction and sincerely 
wish Malaysia prosperity and the Malaysian people happiness. We 
are firmly convinced that the industrious, dynamic and creative 
people of Malaysia, under the clear-sighted leadership of your 
excellency the Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, and the 
other leaders of the national alliance, will certainly bring 
about prosperity for Malaysia and make important contributions 
to the common prosperity of our region as well as of the whole 
of Asia and the Pacific. 
  After nearly half a century of arduous struggle to defend 
our 
national independence, sovereignty and unity, the Vietnamese 
people are now doing their best to build their fatherland, 
striving to become 'a rich people, a strong country, and an 
equitable and civilized society'. In renewing ourselves for 
that lofty goal, we have made very important achievements: 
production is up inflation repelled the people's living standard 
making one step toward improvement social situation stable and 
foreign relations ever broadened. [sentence as received] These 
achievements are providing us with the premise to bring our 
country into a new phase in which we will make a step forward in 
our industrialization and modernization. We are fully conscious 
that this is not a simple work. However, with the tradition of 
dauntlessness in struggle and industry in production, the 
Vietnamese will certainly succeed in building a prosperous 
country and a plentiful and happy life, contributing a worthy 
share to the prosperity of the whole region. 
  Our two countries are indeed close, both situated by a rich 
and beautiful sea.Our two peoples share many similarities in 
culture and history and a past of being colonized by foreign 
powers and having struggled undauntedly and persistently for 
national independence. Today, we also share the aspiration for 
peace and cooperation and the strive toward development and 
prosperity, and toward peace and stability in the region. These 
are the solid foundations for our friendship and long-term 
cooperation in the interest of the prosperity of each country, 
and of cooperation and development in South East Asia. We note 
with satisfaction that owing to the efforts by both sides over 
the past few years, we have forged a bilateral relationship full 
of fraternity and mutual understanding and trust. 
  Our many-sided cooperation has also developed quickly and 
favourably. We are sure that this trend will now continue to 
grow fruitfully for the benefit of both countries. A new proof 
is the exchange of views full of openness, friendship and mutual 
understanding that we have had with your excellency the prime 
minister and other leaders of Malaysia.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 24 -- Prime Minister [P.M.] Vo Van 
Kiet is attending the 27th International General Meeting of the 
Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) which opened in Kuala 
Lumpur on May 23. 
  Addressing the three-day meeting, P.M. Kiet said that the 
dynamic development of the Pacific economies has not only 
brought about well-being for the regional people, but also 
created favourable opportunities for the business circle all 
over the world, with a population of billions, East Asia and 
Southeast Asia is a large market, a big source of labour. 
Especially, the people in the region have a tradition of 
hard-working, education and skillfulness. 
  The Vietnamese prime minister noted that `the social and 
political stability in each country, the trend for peace and 
cooperation in the region have created a reliable environment 
for business. 
  He said that the trend for regionalization in combination 
with that for globalization is developing including Malaysia's 
initiative on the East Asia Economic Cooperation forum. This 
has further strengthened the business opportunities in the 
Pacific, he added. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet expressed the hope that this 
trend 
would not lead to confrontation between the economic blocks and 
closed trade, but step up the broadening of regionalization. 
  The Vietnamese leader went on: 
  `Realizing new opportunities and challenges for the 
developing countries including Vietnam, in recent years we have 
maintained our reform policy developed the market-oriented 
economy and broadened its cooperation with foreign countries. 
  `The achievements recorded in our renovation process have 
helped us gradually stabilize the country's economic development 
process, and at the same time create a new opportunities for 
foreign and Vietnamese businessmen. Nowadays, Vietnam's economy 
keeps on growing, inflation has been driven back, and export 
value and foreign investment increased rapidly. Political and 
social stability has been improved, thus creating a favourable 
environment for foreign and Vietnamese investors. 
  `At present, we are trying to take our country into a new 
stage of development, step by step implementing 
industrialization and modernisation. We have great demands for 
capital, technology, experience in managements and business. 
These are new opportunities for foreign businessmen and 
investors. 
  Mr. Kiet continued `great efforts have been made to improve 
Vietnam's infrastructure. Most of foreign aid has been used for 
upgrading and building roads, sea ports, airports, water and 
electricity supply systems, and so on, many opportunities have 
appeared for foreign businessmen to take part in Vietnam's 
development process in various forms of bidding, investment 
capital contribution, and build-operate-transfer (BOT)'. 
  `A great favourable condition for us and foreign 
businessmen' 
he noted, `is Vietnam's external relations which are broadened 
rapidly. At present, Vietnam has fine relations with all 
neighbours. It is actively preparing to join ASEAN as full 
member and take part in the Pacific institutions. Vietnam has 
established its normal relations of cooperation with 
international organizations,and strengthened its relations with 
most countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and 
America'. 
  `The new dynamic of Vietnam's economy which is promoted by 
the dynamics in the Pacific region, and the country's foreign 
policy of openness, diversification and multilaterization of 
relationship is creating new opportunities of business', he 
concluded.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and Albanian 
President Dr. Sali Berisha held bilateral talks in Kuala Lumpur 
this afternoon. Prime Minister Mahathir offered to share 
Malaysia's experience in privatization to assist Albania in 
developing its free trade zone. Albania has also embarked on a 
privitization program of its state-owned enterprises. 
  According to Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, 
during the two-hour meeting at the Prime Minister's Department, 
President Berisha extended an invitation to Defense Minister 
Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak to visit Albania. The aim is to let 
him study the possibility of promoting bilateral defense 
cooperation. 
  Responding to a newsmen's question on whether or not 
Malaysia 
will use Albania as a gateway for exports of its goods to other 
parts of Europe, Datuk Abdullah said: 
  [Begin Abdullah Ahmad Badawi recording] First, we must study 
in detail the taxation system in that country and if we think 
that it is suitable and can serve our purposes, perhaps we can 
use Albania as a gateway for our goods to enter the European 
markets. [end recording] 
  In another development, Malaysia and Albania today signed 
five agreements to promote closer ties between the two 
countries. The agreements include trade cooperation; investment 
guarantees; avoidance of double taxation; and cooperation on 
economy, science, and technology. The signing ceremony was 
witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir and the 
Albanian president, Dr. Sali Berisha, who is on a four-day visit 
to Malaysia.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 9 - 'One enemy is too many, a hundred 
friends are too few.' Such is the Vietnamese saying which is 
often quoted these days by mouth and in deed by the Vietnamese 
leaders and also the man on the street. The latest examples are 
the visits to Indonesia and Iran by President Le Duc Anh, to 
India by Chairman of the National Assembly Nong Duc Manh, the 
visits to Vietnam by dignitaries from the Czech Republic and 
Ukraine, and the constant influx of foreign business people who 
visit to probe the market opportunities in Vietnam. American 
businesses even held an exhibition in Hanoi to advertize their 
industrial and consumer goods. 
  In the 50 days from March Vietnam hosted over 50 foreign 
delegations of ministerial level and higher and thousands of 
business people. Most notable were the visits by the presidents 
of Mongolia and the Philippines, the prime ministers of 
Singapore, Thailand, Sweden and Australia, the deputy prime 
minister of Russia, and HRH Princess Anne and minister of state 
for external relations of Great Britain. During the same period, 
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Do Muoi 
visited Malaysia, other Vietnamese leaders and high officials 
visited countries in Asia and America. In the coming days, 
President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy 
Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong are expected to visit various 
countries and regions in the world. 
  On all these occasions, Vietnamese leaders reassured their 
guests and hosts that 'Vietnam wants to be friend all the 
countries in the world', that 'Vietnam is trying to build a 
law-governed state and a strong country, a rich people and an 
equitable and civilised society', and that 'Vietnam pursues an 
open, independent and sovereign foreign policy to diversify and 
multilateralise its international relations'. 
  These are the wishes of the Vietnamese people who have 
fought 
through four decades of war to defend and build their country. 
They are also in line with the current trend of the world. 
  In fact, Vietnam has been moving along these lines since the 
beginning of the national renewal, especially since the start of 
the nineties. It has made very important initial achievements, 
including the way the country is viewed in the eyes of the 
people of the world. Instead of Vietnamese fleeing the country, 
the world is seeing Vietnam make an annual GDP growth of 7 to 8, 
which is expected to climb to 9 or 10 over the next few years, 
export about 2 million tons of rice a year and host over 850 
joint-venture and foreign invested projects with a total 
prescribed capital of over 8.5 billion USD. Visiting these 
joint ventures now, one will hear English, French, German, 
Japanese, Chinese, Korean and many other languages. 
  The world also sees an increased presence of American 
businesses in Vietnam. The lifting of the US embargo against 
Vietnam has finally driven home to many Americans that they have 
come too late in the race into the Vietnamese market, and that 
American economic interests in Vietnam are already, really 
sizable. Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai told this writer that 
when the remaining few consular matters are settled, Vietnam and 
the US will open representative offices at each other's capital. 
  When that comes, it will be yet more proof of Vietnam's 
successes in its renewal cause which has helped Vietnam improve 
its bilateral relations with many countries, regions and 
international institutions and organisations.

leaders and also the man on the street. The latest examples are 
the visits to Indonesia and Iran by President Le Duc Anh, to 
India by Chairman of the National Assembly Nong Duc Manh, the 
visits to Vietnam by dignitaries from the Czech Republic and 
Ukraine, and the constant influx of foreign business people who 
visit to probe the market opportunities in Vietnam. American 
businesses even held an exhibition in Hanoi to advertize their 
industrial and consumer goods. 
  In the 50 days from March Vietnam hosted over 50 foreign 
delegations of ministerial level and higher and thousands of 
business people. Most notable were the visits by the presidents 
of Mongolia and the Philippines, the prime ministers of 
Singapore, Thailand, Sweden and Australia, the deputy prime 
minister of Russia, and HRH Princess Anne and minister of state 
for external relations of Great Britain. During the same period, 
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Do Muoi 
visited Malaysia, other Vietnamese leaders and high officials 
visited countries in Asia and America. In the coming days, 
President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy 
Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong are expected to visit various 
countries and regions in the world. 
  On all these occasions, Vietnamese leaders reassured their 
guests and hosts that `Vietnam wants to be friend all the 
countries in the world', that `Vietnam is trying to build a 
law-governed state and a strong country, a rich people and an 
equitable and civilised society', and that `Vietnam pursues an 
open, independent and sovereign foreign policy to diversify and 
multilateralise its international relations'. 
  These are the wishes of the Vietnamese people who have 
fought 
through four decades of war to defend and build their country. 
They are also in line with the current trend of the world. 
  In fact, Vietnam has been moving along these lines since the 
beginning of the national renewal, especially since the start of 
the nineties. It has made very important initial achievements, 
including the way the country is viewed in the eyes of the 
people of the world. Instead of Vietnamese fleeing the country, 
the world is seeing Vietnam make an annual GDP growth of 7 to 8, 
which is expected to climb to 9 or 10 over the next few years, 
export about 2 million tons of rice a year and host over 850 
joint-venture and foreign invested projects with a total 
prescribed capital of over 8.5 billion USD. Visiting these 
joint ventures now, one will hear English, French, German, 
Japanese, Chinese, Korean and many other languages. 
  The world also sees an increased presence of American 
businesses in Vietnam. The lifting of the US embargo against 
Vietnam has finally driven home to many Americans that they have 
come too late in the race into the Vietnamese market, and that 
American economic interests in Vietnam are already, really 
sizable. Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai told this writer that 
when the remaining few consular matters are settled, Vietnam and 
the US will open representative offices at each other's capital. 
  When that comes, it will be yet more proof of Vietnam's 
successes in its renewal cause which has helped Vietnam improve 
its bilateral relations with many countries, regions and 
international institutions and organisations.

these relations would enter into a new stage of development with 
cooperation agreements on economic, scientific and technical, 
and trade fields between the two countries to be signed soon. 
  At the meeting Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said that though 
each country had their own advantage and difficulty, Mongolia 
and Vietnam could promote the mutually-benefit cooperation for 
the interest of the people of each country and of the region.
