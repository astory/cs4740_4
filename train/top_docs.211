PERFORMANCE: JULIO BOCCA, YOUNGEST PRINCIPAL DANCER IN AMERICAN BALLET THEATRE 
HISTORY, SAYS ALL HE EVER WANTED TO DO IS DANCE. THIS WEEK HE AND THE ABT 
PERFORM IN COSTA MESA.

<TEXT>
<P>
At the unprecedented age of 19, Julio Bocca became a principal dancer with 
American Ballet Theatre in 1986, the youngest principal ABT ever had. How did 
the Argentine youngster do it? 
</P>
<P>
Winning the gold medal at the Fifth International Ballet Competition in Moscow 
in 1985 certainly helped. But it was more the result of Bocca's longtime 
single-minded dedication to establishing a dance career. 
</P>
<P>
"I went only for seven years to school, then I stopped," Bocca said recently 
from Miami, where he was staying with friends before heading to Costa Mesa for 
his appearances this week with ABT at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty determined to be a dancer," said Bocca, who was born in Buenos 
Aires and turned 23 on Tuesday. He started his dance training with his mother 
when he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to study at the National Ballet school at the Teatro Colon, joined 
the International Ballet of Caracas at 15 and became a principal dancer with 
Teatro Colon at 17. 
</P>
<P>
Bocca studied and coached with dancers from the Ballets Russes, from whom he 
imbibed a respect for classical line and a deep love of classical roles. 
</P>
<P>
Was it hard for a young man to study ballet in a country dominated by machismo? 
</P>
<P>
"If someone said something to me, I didn't care," he said. "It was their 
problem, not mine." 
</P>
<P>
His meteoric rise to fame occurred after he won the gold medal for dancing four 
virtuosic pas de deux, including "Corsaire," "Don Quixote," "Nutcracker" and 
"Tango" (created by Argentine choreographer Gustavo Molajoli). 
</P>
<P>
But winning not only changed his life -- he talked of one performance before 
100,000 people in Buenos Aires -- it raised the dance consciousness of his 
compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
"After the competition, we had this dance explosion in Argentina," he said. 
"The same thing happened with tennis player Guillermo Vilas. No one played 
tennis before he was a star. Now tennis is fine -- everyone plays. That has 
happened now with ballet. There's a big difference now. Now they have someone 
to see and admire. Now, ballet is for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
International companies came calling too. American Ballet Theatre invited him 
to join the New York company as a principal dancer. His first ballet with ABT 
was the "Nutcracker," followed by the full-length "Don Quixote." During the 
past two years, Orange County and Los Angeles audiences have seen him in "Don 
Quixote" pas de deux, the "Nutcracker," "The Sleeping Beauty" and "Etudes." He 
said he has done all the classical roles with ABT except "Swan Lake." 
</P>
<P>
In these ballets, he has often been partnered with Cheryl Yeager. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheryl was so incredibly nice to me from the beginning," Bocca said. "It was 
my first year in the United States as a principal dancer, when other people 
have to work maybe 10 years to be a principal. . . . She would try to 
understand me and try to explain things to me. She was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
It was for them that former ABT artistic associate Twyla Tharp choreographed 
her newest work, "Brief Fling," which received its premiere last week in San 
Francisco. The two will dance it in Orange County on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the classical roles more than the other things," Bocca admitted. "But 
sometimes, you have to do other things so you can be better and grow up, right? 
When you have this possibility to do a new ballet from Twyla Tharp, I do it and 
enjoy it. I also have a new ballet for me by Roland Petite. . . . But at this 
point, for me, I am interested mostly in the classical roles, just to keep 
growing in the classical roles." 
</P>
<P>
Bocca also will dance Romeo opposite the Juliet of Alessandra Ferri on Friday 
and Sunday afternoon, and Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" with Yeager on 
March 16. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Romeo' is great," he said. "I love to do it. You just enjoy it, listen to 
the music, be sexy with your partner. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
What about Balanchine's "Theme and Variations"? 
</P>
<P>
"That's hard, definitely hard, it has so many steps," he said. "It's one of the 
most difficult ballets, technically. . . . You have to be secure, keyed in, 
like nothing is happening, and also, you can't do a lot of emotional explosion 
because it's not like that, not like the 'Don Quixote' pas de deux. There you 
are very free to do whatever you want. This is so compact, very clean, perfect, 
quiet. It's so difficult." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled ABT's former artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov saying to him, 
"If you can do a good 'Theme and Variations,' you can do a good everything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Bocca has been trying to do "a good everything else" both in and outside the 
United States. In 1988, he joined the Royal Danish Ballet as a guest artist for 
two months, and more recently also danced with Natalia Makarova in "Romeo and 
Juliet" for the Royal Ballet in Great Britain, as well as with the Bolshoi and 
the Kirov ballets in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
After all that, how does the ABT experience stack up? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to compare one company or one dancer to another one," Bocca said. 
"I enjoy dancing, I love dancing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the people in the company," he said. "Sometimes, you want to go 
into a large company, you go work and that's it. The point for me is to try to 
make a good relationship with all the company." 
</P>
<P>
But Bocca does miss his home in Argentina, which he visits as often as ABT's 
schedule permits. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York, when maybe I have two days off, I fly back just to be there even 
for a couple of hours," he said. "I have all my best friends, my family, my 
house, my dog there." 
</P>
<P>
Although he appears slightly self-conscious about his accent, Bocca has no 
trouble expressing himself in English. 
</P>
<P>
"My first year, I still had a little problem with English. Now, it's just 
fine," he said. "I can say something terrible to everyone. I know all the bad 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 American Ballet Theatre principal dancer Julio Bocca will dance Twyla Tharp's 
new "Brief Fling" with Cheryl Yeager at 8 p.m. Thursday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, in Costa Mesa. Bocca also is 
scheduled to dance Romeo opposite the Juliet of Alessandra Ferri in MacMillan's 
"Romeo and Juliet" at 8 p.m. Friday and at 2 p.m. Sunday; Balanchine's "Theme 
and Variations" at 8 p.m. March 16; "Brief Fling" at 8 p.m. March 17, and "La 
Bayadere" Act II at 8 p.m. March 18. Tickets: $10-$40 for mixed repertory 
programs; $16-$47 for "Romeo and Juliet." Information: (714) 556-2787. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ballet Pacifica of Laguna Beach will represent the Pacific region at the Fourth 
International Ballet Competition on June 29 in Jackson, Miss. The 28-year-old 
troupe will dance Norbert Vesak's "Gift to Be Single," set to traditional 
Shaker hymns, on a bill with four other regional dance companies -- the Central 
Pennsylvania Youth Ballet, Fort Wayne Ballet, Augusta Ballet and Dallas 
Metropolitan Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
The International Ballet Competition was founded in Varna, Bulgaria, in 1964 
and is considered one of the most prestigious competitions in dance. It is held 
every four years, rotating between Varna, Helsinki, Moscow and Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoag Foundation of Los Angeles has given $5,000 to Opera Pacific to help 
fund outreach programs for mentally handicapped children in seven Orange County 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The schools, to be visited by Opera Pacific's Overture Company between April 17 
and June 19, are: the Adams School in Santa Ana; Canyon Hills TMR in Anaheim; 
Currie Middle School in Tustin; Esperanza Special Education in Mission Viejo; 
Hope School in Buena Park; Huntington Beach Guidance Center, and the Marion 
Parsons Special Education school in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The grant is the foundation's first to Opera Pacific's special education 
program, which is in its third year. Earlier funding had been provided by Very 
Special Arts National, Opera America, and local organizations.

  [Text] The mission of the international observers in Hebron 
is now under way. This is the first operation of its type in 
the territories occupied by Israel. Giovanni Bocco reports: 
  [Bocco] It was a lightning visit by the delegation of 
international observers in Hebron. Two officers from the 
Italian carabinieri force were also present. They spoke with 
the Palestinian mayor of the city and with the Israelis about 
the organizational aspects of the mandate. 
  There will be 35 Italian observers, but only 15 will be 
permanently stationed in Hebron. After leaving the private 
room, the negotiators entered the council chamber, which was 
full of people. There was a handshake between the mayor, a UN 
delegate, and Yitzhaq Rabin's representative. However, the 
smiles did not hide the fact that there were still many things 
to be decided. The two Italian delegates are Colonel Pietro 
Pistolese and Major Giovanni Trullio. They come from the 
Tuscagna carabinieri parachute regiment, which has already seen 
action in Somalia as part of the Ibis mission. Here is the head 
of the Italian delegation, Colonel Pistolese: 
  [Pistolese] This is the first contact... 
  [Bocco, interrupting] Have you overcome the obstacle of 
security? 
  [Pistolese] No. For the moment there are no security 
problems. We are welcomed and we hope to be good guests. 
  [Bocco] Will you be completely disarmed. I have heard that 
this will be so? 
  [Pistolese] We are working on this. We are just at the 
beginning of our mandate. It is premature... 
  [Bocco, interrupting] How do you think that this meeting has 
gone? 
  [Pistolese] Well. 
  [Bocco] The 160 UN observers: 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes, and 
35 
Italians will have to operate in a difficult situation. Hebron 
is a fortress of the Islamic fundamentalists, but four 
kilometers away there is a colony of some 5,000 Jewish settlers. 
Friction is the order of the day.

  [Text] Let us turn to the Middle East. After having 
ordered the closure of the occupied territories for 10 days 
following the latest round of massacres, the government in 
Jerusalem has decided to allow some 20,000 Palestinians involved 
in social and humanitarian work to be allowed back in. Prime 
Minister Rabin has also announced a plan for the withdrawal of 
Israeli troops from the Golan Heights. Our correspondent 
Giovanni Bocco interviewed Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres: 
  [Begin recording] [Bocco, in English, translating his own 
question into Italian] The Cairo peace negotiations have 
restarted: When do you think an agreement over Gaza and Jericho 
will be reached? 
  [Peres, in English, with correspondent providing Italian 
translation] It appears to me that both ourselves and the PLO 
are respecting the agreements. I believe that the most 
difficult part of the negotiations has been overcome. The 
majority of the workload is behind us. If all goes well, then 
in two or three weeks time we will leave the Gaza Strip. 
  [Bocco] The international observers are arriving in Hebron. 
There are 35 Italians among these observers: What do you think 
about this? 
  [Peres] I believe that this is an important contribution to 
the peace process. The international presence is truly welcome, 
at least on our part, because it is important in bringing normal 
living conditions to Hebron and for preventing acts of violence. 
This welcome extends to the Italian contingent. 
  [Bocco] What do you think of the arrival of the Palestinian 
police force? 
  [Peres] I think that the Palestinians can and must provide 
security measures. They must police themselves. We cannot be 
the policemen of the Palestinians who have every right to have 
their own security force. We are happy that the police force is 
on its way. You cannot imagine how truthful my words are. [end

STAR-CROSS'D CASTING THROWS A WRENCH INTO 'ROMEO AND JULIET' ROMANCE AT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Star-cross'd casting kept a weekend of American Ballet Theatre "Romeo and 
Juliet" performances in Costa Mesa only fitfully satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Now familiar from stage, screen and television, Kenneth MacMillan's 1965 dance 
drama earned its reputation through inspired collaborations -- initially, of 
course, between Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev, but also Lynn Seymour and 
Christopher Gable, for whom the ballet was choreographed. Ballet Theatre, 
however, seems to assume that Romeo, Mercutio and Benvolio are interchangeable 
roles -- and that audiences somehow don't notice when the the lovers are cast 
from cynical (or is it desperate?) expediency. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, pairing Julio Bocca with Alessandra Ferriq on Friday was pretty much 
the same as marrying Juliet off to Paris. Bocca is a brilliant virtuoso but 
scarcely ideal for Romeo either in physical proportions, partnering ability or 
acting skill. In contrast, Ferri is one of the great Juliets of our time, a 
dancing actress of astonishing originality who creates a specific reality in 
each performance -- one that Bocca's bland obviousness continually 
contradicted. 
</P>
<P>
When this Juliet danced, it was always a declaration to her Romeo -- while he 
invariably remained absorbed in showing off feats to the audience. They even 
clashed in death: Bocca's stylized throes and soft, slow, self-protective fall 
to the floor versus Ferri's wild explosion of suicidal despair. 
</P>
<P>
The Saturday matinee leads proved no more compatible -- but they, at least, 
were thrown together by happenstance. Scheduled to dance with other partners, 
Leslie Browne and Wes Chapman found themselves cast opposite one another in 
this ballet for the first time because of an injury to Browne's designated 
Romeo (Ricardo Bustamante). 
</P>
<P>
They responded like pros, of course. Chapman partnered conscientiously, soloed 
capably (though some of the bravura looked underpowered) and showed promise of 
developing a notably sweet and refined characterization: Romeo as dream-prince. 
On this occasion, Browne muted her distinctively sophisticated and contemporary 
interpretation (very post-Seymour) but danced faultlessly. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Kevin McKenzie made a mature, almost world-weary Romeo 
renewed by the virginal innocence of Amanda McKerrow's Juliet -- more like 
Albrecht and Giselle, perhaps, than these Montague and Capulet lovers, but 
clearly the most potent combination of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Although a strained actor, McKenzie had strength and generosity as a partner 
that always made a powerful statement on its own terms -- and it allowed 
McKerrow maximum daring in the great duets. Unlike Ferri and Browne, she didn't 
show Juliet growing wiser or deeper from adversity: She died the same child 
we'd seen playing with a doll. But in her purity of belief and vulnerability, 
she broke your heart. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond showcasing its tragic lovers, MacMillan's "Romeo and Juliet" represents 
a spectacular company vehicle and these first Orange County performances 
boasted a number of high-profile portrayals. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most artful: Georgina Parkinson's alternately steely and volcanic 
Lady Capulet (Friday and Saturday nights), Victor Barbee's complex, formidable 
Tybalt (Friday), Alexander Minz's cerebral Friar Laurence (Friday and Saturday 
evening) and Kathleen Moore's grandmotherly Nurse (Friday and the Saturday 
matinee). 
</P>
<P>
Guillaume Graffin danced unevenly in his first performance as Benvolio (Friday) 
-- but in looks and temperament this is clearly a born Romeo paying his dues. 
As Mercutio, both Johan Renvall (Friday and Saturday afternoon) and John 
Gardner (Saturday evening) settled for lightweight, boyish interpretations put 
over with sharply honed technique. Michael Owen made a conventionally brutish 
Tybalt (Saturday afternoon) and Kevin O'Day (Saturday night) turned the 
character into Brandoesque trade, obviously waiting around Verona for someone 
to invent the motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Everly and Charles Barker alternated as conductor in the three 
performances. Sign of progress: The Mandolin Dance solo in Act II is no longer 
Mercutio's property but belongs, as MacMillan originally intended, to a 
divertissement dancer (Robert Wallace at the first two performances, then Keith 
Roberts). It makes so much more sense that way.

<MEMO>  Dance Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     And speaking of SJCB, what a surprise to discover that the first act of its
and ABT's "Coppelia" are practically photocopies. Though billed as new, ABT's
is really the 1968 production staged by former ballet master Enrique Martinez.
It apparently made an indelible impression on SJCB's director, Dennis Nahat,
who danced in it.;    Both, of course, are based on Arthur Saint-Leon's 1870
original, which avoids all the dark sides of E.T.A. Hoffmann's story. Dr.
Coppelius, the toy-maker, is a Svengali in the story; in the ballet, a
harmless eccentric.;    On opening night Thursday, Cheryl Yeager and Julio
Bocca were the lovers, Swanilda and Franz, who quarrel over Franz's
infatuation with the life-size mechanical doll, Coppelia. (They'll repeat the
roles tonight.) Their sparky exchanges, jubilant delivery and youthful romance
are a delight to watch.;    Other standouts in this cast were Kathleen Moore
and Roger van Fleteren, who led the harvesters' mazurka with panache, and the
slow-burning, luxurious Christine Dunham as the allegorical "Prayer" in the
wedding divertissement.;    There will be multiple casts over the weekend,
including some to stretch your willing suspension of disbelief -- such as the
tall and mature Cynthia Gregory, who dances Sunday evening with Jeremy Collins
as Franz. In that performance, Michael Smuin, former director of San Francisco
Ballet, will chase the bats from Dr. Coppelius' belfry.;    This storybook
"Coppelia" has a surprisingly stodgy set by Tony Straiges, who would have
seemed to be a natural for fairy tales after designing "Into the Woods." Here
he converts an Alpine village to a colorized version of the industrial city of
Frankfurt.;    Patricia Zipprodt's costumes, however, are beautiful excursions
into peasant territory. Jack Everly led the orchestra, which was barely
passable in the first act but respectable in the other two.;     American
Ballet Theater; 'Coppelia'; When: 2 and 8 p.m. today-Sunday; Where: War
Memorial Opera House, 301 Van Ness Ave., San Francisco; Tickets: $15-$65.

   American Ballet Theatre's recent stopover at the
Metropolitan Opera House lasted only nine weeks, but seemed
to go on for years. During one of the season's particularly
arid periods -- when "Coppelia," say, or "Don Quixote" was
the sole work in the repertoire -- one could have sworn that
the company had been running longer than "Cats." "Coppelia,"
which received 11 performances, has already been reviewed in
these pages, "Don Quixote," which received 10, has not.
Originally staged for ABT by Mikhail Baryshnikov, the old
warhorse has now been revised by the Bolshoi's Vladimir
Vasiliev, who has managed the feat of transforming an
unsatisfactory production into a wretched one, by adding
coarse new choreography and even coarser sight gags.
   Most of ABT's ballerinas appeared in the role of the
heroine, Kitri, though only Sylvie Guillem, the company's
newest guest star, drew big houses. Ms. Guillem, who began
her career as a gymnast, still looks like one: Dancing for
her is clearly less important than the demonstration of
physical prowess. In the third act pas de deux of "Don
Quixote," her protracted balances brought down the house --
not because, like the late Margot Fonteyn's, they looked
effortless, but because they looked powerful, a series of
strenuous attempts to overcome the limitations of gravity.
The fact that Ms. Guillem failed to maintain her poses with
perfect steadiness did nothing to spoil her success. Every
falter was taken as further testimony to the ballerina's
indomitable sense of purpose, and incited the crowd to
further acclaim.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Except in her exquisite, if expressionless, face, the
Amazonian Ms. Guillem shows none of the feminine grace
usually associated with classical ballet. Broad-shouldered,
hyper-extended and commandingly tall, she nonetheless adopts
a shy and modest demeanor that contrasts disconcertingly with
the force of her dancing and the implicit willpower it
expresses. In tackling parts like the mischievous innkeeper's
daughter in "Don Quixote" and the remote but passionate
temple dancer in "La Bayadere," she offers less a portrayal
than an impersonation.
   Nowhere was the discrepancy between physical identity and
characterization more glaring than in Agnes de Mille's "Fall
River Legend." As the inhibited New England spinster Lizzie
Borden, who chops up her parents, Ms. Guillem was an
unconvincing wolf in sheep's clothing. "Fall River Legend" is
not merely a poor choice for her particular gifts, it is a
poor ballet. A pop version of one of Martha Graham's cloudy
psychodramas, "Fall River Legend" is psychologically
imperceptive and choreographically vacant. It is also
ludicrously overwrought, though not enough to be genuinely
funny. Along with the now lifeless works of Antony Tudor, it
is part of the barren heritage that ABT needs to junk if it
is ever to get anywhere.
   Ms. Guillem is by no means the only talented dancer at ABT
who doesn't know what roles she looks good in. Julio Bocca
cut a better figure in "Giselle" midway in the season than he
had done in "Coppelia" on opening night, but nowhere as good
a one as he did last year in Mark Morris's "Drink to Me Only
With Thine Eyes" and Twyla Tharp's "Brief Fling." In neither
of these ballets, however, did he appear this time around.
Apparently, he finds both assignments unrewarding. What he
obviously doesn't understand is that in Mr. Morris's richly
inventive work, he has a role that, though made for Mikhail
Baryshnikov, suits him to perfection, and that in "Brief
Fling," especially created for him by Ms. Tharp, his gifts of
energy, speed, virtuosity and charm were used so brilliantly
that for the first time he looked like a star.
   Lacking in self-knowledge though he is, Mr. Bocca at least
has had the chance to work with a genuine choreographer at a
crucial stage in his development. Most of the other talented
young dancers in the company have been less lucky. Amanda
McKerrow, Alessandra Ferri, Gabrielle Brown, Amy Rose,
Christina Fagundes, Julie Kent, Kathleen Moore, Cynthia
Anderson, Christine Dunham, Isabella Padovani -- all have
notable qualities that a first-rate choreographer could no
doubt bring properly into focus. To judge from the fate of
Cynthia Gregory, the chances that this will happen are
slight. During her 26 years with the company, Ms. Gregory has
given many fine performances. Somewhere along the way,
though, the poetical beauty that marked her dancing in the
early 1960s with the San Francisco Ballet was replaced by an
all-purpose competence, and a great ballerina got lost.
   The gifts of the young Fernando Bujones, though not as
remarkable as Ms. Gregory's, were nevertheless conspicuous,
too. Unfortunately, during his two decades with ABT, he
failed to realize them just as surely as she failed to
realize hers. This season, Mr. Bujones, who now dances less
frequently than in the past, was invited to re-stage the
company's "Raymonda, Act III," originally adapted by Mikhail
Baryshnikov from the 1898 choreography of Marius Petipa.
Again, ABT has exchanged a weak production for a dismal one.
Mr. Bujones's "Raymonda" revealed so fundamentally incoherent
a concept of classicism that his cast looked hobbled by
stylistic indeterminacy. Moreover, the character dances,
designed to provide a contrast with the classical passages,
were depressingly limp.
   Nevertheless, at ABT these days some of the best
performing is to be found in character roles, especially
those that call for mime. In Kathleen Moore and Victor
Barbee, especially, the company has two of the most
persuasive dancer-actors of today. Perhaps ABT could lend
them to New York City Ballet when the latter revives "The
Sleeping Beauty" next spring.

   Dance: Euroschlock Threatens ABT

   New York -- It's difficult to feel much optimism about the
future of American Ballet Theatre. Unless ABT starts showing
more signs of creative integrity than it has so far under its
new directors, Jane Hermann and Oliver Smith, the company is
hardly likely to survive for very long. Though such an
appraisal may seem premature, the interviews Ms. Hermann and
Mr. Smith have been giving do not inspire confidence in their
artistic judgment.
   What they are planning is to give ABT an infusion of
Euroschlock -- works by those drearily familiar figures, some
of them expatriate Americans, who have made careers out of
portentousness rather than steps: James Kudelka, Maguy Marin,
Glen Tetley and Jiri Kylian. Next season is to bring Mr.
Kylian's meretricious "Sinfonietta," last seen at the Met in
1979 during the visit of Mr. Kylian's own Netherlands Dance
Theater. To help us survive the two years it apparently is
going to take for this choreographer to come forth with a new
ballet for ABT, we are to get a re-working by the Bolshoi's
Vladimir Vasiliev of Mikhail Baryshnikov's version of that
old warhorse, "Don Quixote."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In none of their interviews did the directors say a single
word about Mark Morris, whose "Drink to Me Only With Thine
Eyes," commissioned by Mr. Baryshnikov in 1988, is both
surpassingly beautiful and -- though it only was accorded two
performances in the current ABT season -- a crowd pleaser.
They said scarcely more about Twyla Tharp. From what they did
say, it's hard to believe that Ms. Hermann and Mr. Smith
realize how fortunate they are to have a new ballet by her in
the current season's repertoire, as well as enough hits by
her to make up an entire evening.
   There's little doubt that this Tharp triple bill excited
the audience as much as anything presented all season. "Push
Comes to Shove," it's true, wanted edge. But, then, it's no
less an ensemble piece than a star vehicle, and the ensemble
looked under-rehearsed, while Gil Boggs, in the role created
in 1976 by Mr. Baryshnikov, showed none of the latter's comic
flair. "In the Upper Room" also looked as if it needed more
rehearsal, but came off better. Its association of order with
energy is theatrically potent, and the audience greeted the
final curtain with the kind of roar that signifies
identification as well as excitement. "Nine Sinatra Songs,"
new to the repertoire, sent waves of euphoria rolling through
the auditorium.
   The Sinatra ballet is a good example of what Ms. Tharp has
to offer ABT -- apart, that is, from a brilliant work, in
which ballroom dancing, enhanced by virtuosity, illuminates
behavior, feelings and the vagaries of human nature. At the
same time, the piece does wonders for the performers,
especially those who, like Susan Jaffe, Christine Dunham and
Amanda McKerrow, have talent but seem incapable of realizing
it fully without better artistic guidance than they evidently
get at ABT. Apart from Leslie Browne, all the cast responds
to the technical challenges of "Nine Sinatra Songs" with a
whole heartedness that transmutes proficiency into art. The
metamorphosis of Ms. McKerrow was one of the season's big
pleasures. For the first time, she looked not like a
promising neophyte but a mature artist. Maybe in due course
Twyla Tharp could even rescue Ms. Browne.
   The choreographer's ability to isolate the essential gifts
of a particular dancer has never been more clearly in
evidence than in her handling of Cheryl Yeager, whom Ms.
Tharp cast as the female lead in her new piece for ABT,
"Brief Fling." Until Ms. Yeager appeared in this ballet, her
artistic resources seemed limited to a combination of
pertness and a disarming, if unfocused buoyancy. "Brief
Fling" gave her the chance to show that she has something
more interesting to offer. In the case of her partner, Julio
Bocca, Ms. Tharp has extended his range and concentrated his
gifts.
   Both Ms. Yeager and Mr. Bocca perform at breathtaking
speed the most dazzling steps and combinations. Because the
choreographer has so clear an understanding of the different
capabilities of male and female dancers, she makes their
prowess complementary as well as competitive, and thus a
metaphor of sexual harmony. In demonstrating the resources of
classical ballet technique, Ms. Tharp tests the pair to the
limits of speed, precision, daring and stamina. The results
are exhilarating -- not simply because the dancers exemplify
an ideal freedom from ordinary physical limitations, but
because they also embody an energy that transcends mere
physicality.
   In composing these dances, as well as those for the two
pairs of demi-soloists -- Claudia Alfieri and Gil Boggs, and
Isabella Padovani and Robert Wallace or Johan Renvall -- Ms.
Tharp shows a thorough mastery of ballet technique. The same,
unfortunately, cannot be said of Mr. Kylian, Mr. Kudelka, Mr.
Tetley and Ms. Marin, nor of that current ABT favorite, Agnes
de Mille, whose foolish and glib "Fall River Legend" has just
been disinterred by the new ABT management.
   Like so many of Ms. Tharp's works, "Brief Fling"
juxtaposes classical ballet with the choreographer's
idiosyncratic postmodern choreography, the latter wonderfully
performed by Jamie Bishton, Kevin O'Day, Keith Roberts and
Shelley Washington. There is no conflict between the two
kinds of dance, only an illuminating dissimilarity. "Brief
Fling" is at once about co-existence and variety. Properly
understood, the piece demonstrates how ballet can survive
after the death of Balanchine, whose work has brought an
entire phase of the art to a glorious but inhibiting
conclusion.

ABT'S BRIEF AND FRENZIED FLING WITH THARP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year go, Twyla Tharp was a provocative fixture at American Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Baryshnikov -- the matinee idol who ran the company when he wasn't too 
busy making movies or acting in plays or dancing elsewhere -- had elected the 
irresistibly iconoclastic choreographer as his "artistic associate." Going 
straight, in her finely frenzied fashion, Tharp disbanded her touring ensemble 
and joined the ABT team. 
</P>
<P>
She took some of her specialized repertory with her, not to mention a few of 
her own dancers. The collaboration with Baryshnikov &amp; Co. produced some 
appealingly gutsy work as well as some lavish show-bizzy fizzles. Then came the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov quit Ballet Theatre in a managerial huff. Tharp's name disappeared 
from the managerial roster. 
</P>
<P>
Her future with the company remains clouded. Her present, however, remains 
dazzling, and pleasantly disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
The latest addition to the Tharp oeuvre, first applauded in San Francisco a 
week ago and introduced at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on 
Thursday, is a legacy of the Baryshnikov era. It bears what may be a prophetic 
title: "Brief Fling." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the fling refers -- or at least pretends to refer -- to a 
charming highland ritual. This is Tharp's Scottish symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind searching for sylphides. Tharp's fling is fast and furious, taut and 
tense. It is refined on the surface yet rough inside. Or is it vice-versa? One 
is never quite sure, and that adds to the compelling intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, the ballet looks reasonably polite. It strikes amusing, even 
dainty poses. Then it takes off in potentially suicidal flights, often for 
their own frantic sake. Eventually, Tharp chooses some shocking structural and 
dynamic detours. 
</P>
<P>
The quaint becomes dangerous. The cheer turns dark. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Colombier provided the loud -- too loud -- musical impetus for this 
fusion of strict classicism and feverish adventure. Manipulating the 
technological miracles of tape and computer, he concocted a sonic tapestry that 
innocently explores the country gardens and stranded Handels of Percy Grainger, 
only to succumb to the easy dissonances and portentous rumbles we associate 
with horror flicks. 
</P>
<P>
The score may suggest candy-coated modernism. The choreography, thank goodness, 
does not. 
</P>
<P>
It toys brazenly with a tippy-toe tattoo. It showcases a frenzied ballerina in 
a tartan tutu, partnered by a fearless, airborne cavalier. It adds the casual 
counterforce of some muscular modernists who happen to specialize in bravura 
funk. In a bizarre, perfectly coordinated, essentially symmetrical suite of 
fugues and gigues, flirtations and confusions, the twain eventually meet. 
</P>
<P>
If the clash of impulses is unsettling, its progress is organic and its 
resolution strangely comforting. Cheryl Yeager, the brilliant ballerina, and 
Julio Bocca, her firebrand partner, become more interesting as they shed their 
royal manners. Resident Tharpians -- the devastating Shelley Washington, 
accompanied by Kevin O'Day, Keith Roberts and Jamie Bishton -- become even more 
compelling when they stretch for classical impact. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting corps includes such energetic paragons as Claudia Alfieri, 
Isabella Padovani, Gil Boggs and Robert Wallace. They sustain the aura of 
mock-nationalistic unity and bridge the stylistic gap with splendid, overwound 
bravado. 
</P>
<P>
In this ultracompact 20-minute opus, Tharp redefines conventional rules of 
partnering. She mocks the traditions she observes. More important, perhaps, she 
understands the tradition she mocks. 
</P>
<P>
"Brief Fling" bristles with nervous outbursts, yet dares unwind just when one 
expects a final zonking climax. It shouts its abstract drama. That makes its 
occasional whisper of lyricism all the more affecting. 
</P>
<P>
Isaac Mizrahi has decorated the piece with a bizarre jumble of parody costumes. 
Misplaced plaids and tilted tams adorn a generally courtly corps. Some of the 
men sport formal kilts but no shirts. Baggy slacks coexist with prissy toe 
shoes. The sartorial worlds collide neatly, tellingly. 
</P>
<P>
One sees obvious texts and complex subtexts here. Tharp has much going on. Too 
much, perhaps, for one to absorb in a single viewing. The prospect of 
repetitions -- many and frequent -- is reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
ABT surrounded the novelty with familiar fare. When, one had to wonder, will 
Tharp come up with the full-length ballet she owes us. 
</P>
<P>
The evening opened with the ubiquitous "Kingdom of the Shades" episode from "La 
Bayadere." Susan Jaffe served as a radiant Nikiya, nobly partnered by Kevin 
MacKenzie as Solor and unevenly seconded by Leslie Browne, Cynthia Anderson and 
Christine Dunham as her fluttery attendants. 
</P>
<P>
The 24 ghostlets in white executed their Petipa arabesques rather shakily. The 
brisk tempos favored by Emil de Cou hardly reinforced the aura of otherworldly 
languor, but Ron Oakland (uncredited in the program) performed the violin solos 
exquisitely. 
</P>
<P>
A kind and gentle performance of Agnes de Mille's "Rodeo" completed the bill. 
Shawn Black -- still ranked a member of the corps de ballet -- undertook the 
central conflicts of the cowgirl for the first time, and did so sweetly if a 
bit sketchily. 
</P>
<P>
Ethan Brown didn't strut much stuff in his debut as the head wrangler, and 
Julie Kent seemed content to be blandly pretty in her first outing as the other 
woman. John Gardner returned as the sympathetic, soft-grained champion roper. 
Leading the excellent Pacific Symphony, Jack Everly served Copland heartily in 
the pit.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Dance: Choreography's the Trouble at ABT </HL>
<AUTHOR> Dale Harris </AUTHOR>

<DATELINE> New York  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Let's hope that the gala performance by American Ballet Theater that opened the First New York International Festival of the Arts on Saturday was not a paradigm for the entire monthlong celebration. 
Though the evening got off to a brilliant start with Mark Morris's "Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes," it then, suddenly and irrevocably, fell flat on its face. 

   The problem, as usual, was the choreography -- on this occasion, two works new to the ABT repertory: Antony Tudor's "Fandango," originally created 25 years ago for the long-vanished Metropolitan Opera Ballet Company; and Clark Tippet's "S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A," a world premiere. 

   For the resuscitation of "Fandango," underwritten by the Festival, there's really no excuse. 
The ballet, a sophomoric joke about the rivalry of five female dancers (Shawn Black, Deirdre Carberry, Christina Fagundes, Marianna Tcherkassky and Cheryl Yeager), set to some slight keyboard pieces by Antonio Soler, looked choreographically negligible when it was new. 
It still does, even though nowadays it's a great deal better danced than it was in 1963. 
The genius of Antony Tudor lasted only a few years: from "Lilac Garden" of 1936 to "Romeo and Juliet" of 1943. 
What came before was apprentice work; what came after was a series of earnest, often tedious, failures, interspersed with a number of inconsequential trifles. 
Most of these have been deservedly forgotten. 
It does no service to Tudor's memory to interfere with the workings of a just oblivion. 

   "S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A." -- surely the worst ballet title since Balanchine's "Glinkaiana" -- stands for the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber shop Quartet Singing in America. 
Its music is a string of old-fashioned popular songs, such as "Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie." 
They are sung from the orchestra pit in close (and not-so-close) harmony by the Cracker Jacks. 
"S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A." is plainly meant to be a lighthearted romp. 
Indeed, for the undemanding gala audience, it proved a big hit. 
Nevertheless, it's hard to see what future it could possibly have in the regular repertory of ABT, since it contains virtually nothing in the way of dance interest. 

   Though conceived, formally speaking, in terms of a vaudeville act, the ballet is less like a professional show than an all-male college romp, in which a group of ordinary fellas -- on this occasion, four of them -- do a lot of horsin' around, mainly to the delight of one another. 
There's the usual joke about the fella who kisses another fella, who mimes mock outrage and disgust. 
There's the inevitable skit in which one of these regular guys dresses up in drag and plays a comic vamp, complete with breasts made of watermelon halves. 
There's the familiar soft-shoe number, in which they wear striped shirts, suspenders and straw hats. 
There's the inescapable number that, right at the end, introduces a serious note into the hitherto comic proceedings. 

   Despite the built-in problems of such a concept (which include the fact that a barbershop quartet makes less impact in a house the size of the Met than a solo piano), it's just conceivable that the piece might nevertheless have turned out to be charming had it been staged by someone who, like Twyla Tharp, is both an inventive choreographer and an aficionado of popular music and dance forms. 
Mr. Tippet, alas, is neither, and the results are merely dull. 
Until, that is, the final, serious number, when, without warning, "S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A." descends into bathos and becomes a ballet about male bonding. 
In what is clearly intended as the climax of the work (the equivalent of "But seriously, folks . . ."), the choreographer presents a pair of lyrical pas de deux, a celebration, in other words, of the buddy beautiful. 
And this -- without a hint of irony -- is set to "America the Beautiful." 
Even as danced by four of ABT's most talented males, John Gardner, Robert Hill, Kevin McKenzie and the astonishingly agile Robert Wallace, Mr. Tippet's latest work is tough going. 

   With this artistically uneven program, which ended with Leonide Massine's joyless "Gaite Parisienne," ABT brought its annual eight-week engagement at the Met to a close. 
Apart from Mr. Morris's "Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes," the rewards of the season have been less creative than interpretive. 
One of the most memorable events of this sort was the pair of "Bayadere" performances danced, with hardly any warning to the public, by two guests from Leningrad's Kirov Ballet, Altynai Assylmuratova and Farukh Ruzimatov. 
Though Ms. Assylmuratova is not a stranger to American audiences, she had never before been given the opportunity to show them the full extent of her gifts. 
At the Met, she enjoyed a well-deserved triumph. 
Above all, she is a dancer whose every movement is informed by intimations of the classical ideal. 
In the second act of "La Bayadere," she performed the steps with a combination of precision and passion, of impersonal beauty and emotional depth that no one has displayed in this role since the heyday of Dame Margot Fonteyn. 

   However, she is unlike anyone but herself. 
She shows, it's true, many of the characteristics of the Kirov school, including the consolidation of expressive power in the torso rather than in the legs, which suffer from the weakness of all dancers trained in Leningrad. 
Nevertheless, she is something new in current Soviet dance: a ballerina whose force of personality stems, not from overly dramatic accentuation in phrasing, but from an all-pervasive lyric energy. 
That energy is manifest whether she is moving or still, for which reason she remains part of the dance even when standing on the sidelines. 
Her musicality -- an exceedingly rare quality at the Kirov -- helps too. 
So does her remarkable beauty. 
Her small, exquisitely molded head, set on a long tapering neck and framed by sleek black hair, distills the beauty of her movements into a drama that has less to do with personality than with spirit. 

   Her partner, Mr. Ruzimatov, though the Kirov's finest male dancer by far, is less extraordinary, a performer who, at his best, pleases rather than thrills. 
He may not jump very high, for example, but he lands with pantherine grace. 

   Met audiences, brainwashed by the untiring advocacy of Soviet ballet that appears in the local papers, seem to believe that all male dancers from the U.S.S.R. are superhuman. 
At any rate, every time that Mr. Ruzimatov made a move, they gasped in, for the most part, entirely unwarranted disbelief. 

   As it happens, more than one of the males on ABT's regular roster can eclipse Mr. Ruzimatov in sheer technical brilliance -- Robert Wallace, for example, or Wes Chapman. 
Or the 21-year-old Julio Bocca, whose gifts are simply prodigious. 
What the Soviet performer has over his ABT counterparts, however, is coaching. 
When Mr. Bocca appeared as Albrecht during the last week of the season, his dancing, though breathtaking, had nothing to do with his characterization, or even with the way he presented himself to the audience. 
The steps were astounding, the other aspects of his performance virtually nonexistent. 
It's a problem ABT needs to address.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: New York Balanchine bonanza - David Vaughan attends
the final gala performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New York City Ballet's Balanchine Celebration, about which Clement Crisp
wrote in its early stages, came to a triumphant end on Sunday with a gala
performance that began at 4 in the afternoon and lasted until 10.30 in the
evening, with intermissions when cocktails and zakouski (Russian hors
d'oeuvres) or American dessert (brownies and carrot cake) were served, and a
longer break when you could get a box supper prepared according to
Balanchine's own recipes.
As for the dancing, the programme reprised the chronological format of the
season as a whole, but with an international flavour to illustrate the fact
that Balanchine generously gave his ballets to companies all over the world.
Guest artists from the Kirov, the Paris Opera, the Royal Ballet, American
Ballet Theatre, Dance Theatre of Harlem, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific
Northwest Ballet (Seattle) appeared alongside City Ballet dancers.
Thus, there was a multinational Apollo with the Danish/American Nilas
Martins and Zhanna Ayupova (Kirov), Patricia Barker (Seattle) and Isabelle
Guerin (Paris) as his muses. The sensation of the evening was Darcy Bussell
in the pas de deux from Agon (with Lindsay Fischer), proving that she is a
born Balanchine dancer. In Who Cares? Viviana Durante danced 'The Man I
Love' with Robert LaFosse and Elizabeth Loscavio (San Francisco) spun
vertiginously through 'My One and Only.' At the end dancers and audience
joined in a vodka toast to Mr B. The waiter with the drinks for Peter
Martins, Lincoln Kirstein and Jerome Robbins was none other than Mikhail
Baryshnikov.
As Clement Crisp indicated, the heroines of this extraordinary marathon were
Kyra Nichols and Darci Kistler, to whom I would add Nichol Hlinka, who gave
a delicious account of Donizetti Variations with Nikolaj Haabbe, the
company's latest Danish recruit and of Columbine in Harlequinade, opposite a
mercurial Damian Woetzel, and, with Peter Boal, realised all the tragic
poetry of the Divertimento from 'Le Baiser de la fee'. It must be added that
some ballets were sadly undercast, most conspicuously when Nilas Martins,
the son of Peter Martins, ballet master in chief, attempted roles like
Orpheus and Apollo.
There is a dwindling number of dancers in the principal ranks who knew
Balanchine. The next generation will come from the School of American
Ballet, whose senior students also danced a selection of Balanchine excerpts
in this year's 'Workshop' performances, as well as one complete ballet,
Symphonie Concertante, in acknowledgment of the fact that it was originally
made for the school, in 1945. Nearly 50 years later, the very promising
Rachel Rutherford and Tara Keim danced the leading roles. Rutherford,
partnered by the elegant Peter Hansen, was also ravishing in 'Tales from the
Vienna Woods' from Vienna Waltzes.
Symphonie Concertante was also in the repertory of American Ballet Theatre
this year at the Metropolitan Opera House. Kevin McKenzie, the highly
respected dancer who has taken over the artistic direction, announced before
the season that he intended to take the company back to its old policy of
emphasising the 'theatre' aspect of the company's title. No brand-new works
were given, but the company took into its repertory Kenneth MacMillan's
Manon and Christian Holder's Les Liaisons dangereuses. Concerning the
latter, I can only echo Clement Crisp's remark about Glen Tetley's La Ronde:
'it lasts - was that all? - 50 minutes.' Manon is probably the best of
MacMillan's full-length ballets, certainly the one most accessible to
companies other than the Royal Ballet. Alessandra Ferri and Cynthia Harvey
have both danced the title role there, and are thoroughly at home in it.
Ferri was partnered by Julio Bocca, not the subtlest of dance actors. But
the supporting company, led by such artists as Gil Boggs and Robert Wallace
(who both danced Lescaut), Kathleen Moore, Victor Barbee, and Ethan Brown,
showed that they can form an acting ensemble worthy of comparison with the
Royal Ballet itself.
The revival of David Blair's production of Swan Lake looked rather dated,
but it is at least a straightforward rendering of the traditional
choreography. Nina Ananiashvili and Bocca gave it the old fashioned star
treatment, neither to their own nor to the ballet's advantage. Otherwise, it
was the ballets with the highest dance values that came off best, notably
Ashton's Symphonic Variations and Mark Morris's Drink to me only with thine
eyes.
Another Mark Morris work was seen in the brief season at the City Center of
Les Grands Ballets Canadiens: Paukenschlag, to Haydn's Symphony No. 94 (the
'Surprise'). Morris is sometimes criticised for being too close to the
music, but what he does in a ballet like this is wittily and inventively to
clarify the music's structure.
Morris has been busily turning out new pieces for his own company, which
will be seen later in the summer at Edinburgh.

<HEAD>Two NY Premieres and Fracci at Ballet Theater</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Ballet Theater dancers looked wonderful
on the second night of the company's season at the Metropolitan
Opera. The program was two New York premieres, a dazzling ``Black
Swan'' pas de deux and ``Lilac Garden'' starring Carla Fracci.
   The Italian ballerina returned to American Ballet Theater as a
guest to perform in an excerpt from ``Lilac Garden'' at Monday's
gala opening and the entire Antony Tudor ballet on Tuesday night.
   The entire ballet, to Chausson's ``Poeme,'' was as achingly
romantic as it is meant to be. The young bride-to-be, danced by
Miss Fracci with subtlety and gentle beauty, is stoical but
suffering because in love with a younger man. He was danced with
romantic yearning by Kevin McKenzie.
   Ross Stretton as the Man She Must Marry was stiff with his
bride-to-be but softer when he met An Episode in His Past in the
lilac garden. She, danced by Martine Van Hamel, seemed a strong
survivor but she was hurting, too.
   The evening began with ``Birthday Offering,'' which Frederick
Ashton choreographed for the 25th anniversary of the British Royal
Ballet. It gives important solos to seven ballerinas, showing each
one's strength. Ballet Theater added it to its repertory last
October in Houston.
   On Tuesday, the star ballerina was Susan Jaffe, partnered by
Stretton. The others were Cheryl Yeager, Amanda McKerrow, Julie
Kent, Leslie Browne, Alessandra Ferri and Christine Dunham. All
looked good.
   Fernando Bujones, back this season as a guest, having been
greatly missed, and Cynthia Harvey danced the ``Black Swan'' pas de
deux. Both were in the highest, exciting form. Toward the end of
the duet, Miss Harvey danced only 16 of the famous 32 fouettes,
whipped-leg turns. The audience murmured, fearing she had felt a
muscle tear, but she finished the duet flawlessly.
   The evening ended with the half-hour ``Brief Fling'' which Twyla
Tharp choreographed for the company. This eclectic, quite enjoyable
ballet had its premiere in February in San Francisco.
   In it, Cheryl Yeager and Julio Bocca, in Navy, do formal ballet
dancing to ``I'm a Little Teapot'' played on amplified piano.
Shelley Washington, loose-limbed as Miss Tharp was as a dancer,
looked like an urchin being tossed around by Jamie Bishton, Kevin
O'Day and Keith Roberts in mini-kilts. Claudia Alfieri, Isabella
Padovani, Gil Boggs and Robert Wallace wore red plaid.
   During the 10 sections of ``Brief Fling'' there also was a jig
and music which sounded like minimalism meeting a cement mixer. The
music was by Michel Colombier. Clever costumes were by Isaac
Mizrahi.
   Dennis Cleveland played the violin solo in ``Lilac Garden.'' The
orchestra sounded thin, as though too small for the requirements of
the music.

<LEADPARA>  THE NEW American Ballet Theater and the bad old ABT jockeyed for supremacy at
the company's opening Tuesday, parading a most discomfiting case of artistic
split personality to the gala crowd.;    On the one hand, there was "Ballet
Imperial," a piece of routine Balanchine, in a slipshod performance that
looked as if the corps had last rehearsed it a year ago.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  ABT IS CAUGHT AT CROSS-PURPOSES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Dance Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     On the other, there was the commanding "Sinfonietta," a 1978 work by Czech
choreographer Jiri Kylian, just acquired by ABT for the current season.;   
And in between, there was "Other Dances," an exquisite Jerome Robbins
miniature, danced to perfection but programmed for the wrong reasons.;    It's
not fashionable to like the neo-romantic Kylian these days, but I love his
gleaming physical response to complex music. This piece, like "Forgotten Land"
(in San Francisco Ballet's repertory), is set in a wide, allusive landscape,
which it pulls down to human scale by discovering real emotions in its
abstract world.;    "Sinfonietta" calls for a chamber company of seven couples
-- small forces to challenge the brooding, brass-heavy score by Kylian's
countryman, Leos Janacek. This magnificent piece calls for 25 brass players,
including 12 (!) trumpets. Unfortunately, either there weren't enough strings
for all this brazen glory, or else the pit muffled them. The performance,
though sensitively led by Jack Everly, seemed a bit thin.;    Kylian's dancers
shape this sound into movement with a breathtaking combination of exuberance
and yearning, their springy, sinewy leaps seemingly suspended in mid-air.
Unlike "Forgotten Land," whose movements come from the ebb and flow of the
tide against the shore, this piece is grounded in the earth's energy -- like
the mythological giant Antaeus, who literally renewed his strength every time
he made contact with his mother, Gaia (the earth).;    Everything about the
piece added to its powerful beauty, from the performances -- all so resonant
that I can't single any out -- to the simple, almost monastic costumes (by
Walter Nobbe) to the aquarelle backdrop (also by Nobbe). Under Joop Caboort's
lighting, this striated, horizontal landscape was sometimes arid, sometimes
verdant.;    "Other Dances" replaced Mark Morris' wonderful "Drink to Me Only
With Thine Eyes" because the estate of the woman who commissioned the former
work in 1976 -- the retired ballerina Eugenia Delarova Doll, who died last
year -- just gave $250,000 to ABT. Money not only talks, it seems, but also
sometimes dances.;    However, barring the slavishness of the gesture, it's a
lovely suite for two well-tuned dancers -- here, Alessandra Ferri and Julio
Bocca, worthy successors to Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, for whom
it was made.;    Paul Connelly, who is one of the conductors vying for the San
Jose Symphony post, played the score -- four mazurkas and a waltz by Chopin --
beautifully, though one wished the piano had been as well tuned as the
dancers.;    Let's not dwell on "Ballet Imperial" (1941), except to say that
Susan Jaffe was the only real dancer on stage. Jaffe, who is married to
Connelly, substituted for the indisposed Cynthia Harvey.;    I don't know what
those other 30 folks were doing up there, except going through the motions.
Ricardo Bustamante, the cavalier, performed with a long-suffering expression,
while poor Amanda McKerrow, a charming dancer, was imprisoned in a pink tutu
that washed out her pale coloring.;    The rest of the ballet suits its score,
Tchaikovsky's grand and empty Piano Concerto No. 2. Instead of taking a bow,
pianist Michael Boriskin should have spent intermission in the pit with a
broom, sweeping up all the notes he dropped.;    ABT's revival of "Coppelia"
-- Enrique Martinez's 1968 choreography gussied up with new sets and costumes
-- opens tonight. The company performs in San Francisco through April 7.;

<LEADPARA>  THE trouble with anniversaries is that the day after each one is the first day
of the rest of your life. American Ballet Theater, which will play San
Francisco this week and next, found this out after its 25th, its 30th, its
40th and last year after its 50th birthday.;    This is the off-year: an
asymmetrical, unround 51. It's a year of questions about identity and artistic
direction, and, of course, financial woes. (So how is that different from any
other dance company in America?)  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  TOEING THE LINE
A MORE MODEST ABT MAKES ITS ANNUAL VISIT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Dance  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The finances have had more impact than the company likes to admit. Once the
most traveled ballet in the world, ABT has pulled back its tours to just a few
key cities. Its repertory, geared to splashy, big-budget ballets for
star-struck audiences, is even less consequential than in some other years:
The company can't afford to challenge its patrons.;    The question of
artistic leadership continues to bedevil ABT. Ever since Mikhail Baryshnikov
quit in a huff just as plans for the 50th-anniversary gala were set in motion,
the dance world has wondered who is running the company. It is, in fact, being
run by co-director Jane Hermann, but no one wants to believe this is more than
a temporary situation -- except Hermann, an arts administrator who; controls
casting and chooses repertory as if she had come up through the ranks of
dance.;    In the meantime, many of the promises made last fall, when ABT
announced its San Francisco season, have melted. The roster of guests is down
to just one: Sylvie Guillem, the long-stemmed French ballerina who will make
her ABT debut as the company plays San Francisco and Orange County. Farukh
Ruzimatov of the Leningrad Kirov Ballet, announced with fanfare, isn't coming.
Andris Liepa of the Bolshoi Ballet parted company with Hermann more than a
year ago and went back to the Soviet Union.;    Because principal dancer Clark
Tippet is not well, his new ballet isn't ready, and he is the only in-house
choreographer in the company, which once presented the newest ballets of major
choreographers before the ink had dried.;    The repertory for the 1991 tour
includes two full-length ballets: the charming "Coppelia" (Thursday-next
Sunday) and the languorous "La Bayadere" ("The Temple Dancer") (April 5-7).;  
 "Coppelia," a favorite of San Jose Cleveland Ballet audiences, who saw it in
1989 and 1990, is a comic ballet about a life-size mechanical doll who causes
havoc between the lovers Franz and Swanilda.;    This production is billed as
"new," but it's a revival of the 1968 staging by ballet master emeritus
Enrique Martinez, after Arthur St.-Leon's 1870 original. The music is by Leo
Delibes. There are new costumes and scenery by Tony Award-winning designers
Patricia Zipprodt ("Sweet Charity" and "Cabaret") and Tony Straiges ("Into the
Woods" and "Sunday in the Park With George").;    The roles of Swanilda and
Franz will be danced by Cheryl Yeager and Julio Bocca (Thursday and Saturday);
Amanda McKerrow and Danilo Radojevic (Friday); Cynthia Harvey and Wes Chapman
(Saturday matinee); Marianna Tcherkassky and Johan Renvall (next Sunday's
matinee); and Cynthia Gregory and Jeremy Collins (next Sunday evening).;   
Dr. Coppelius, the crackpot toy-maker who has built the almost-human doll,
traditionally steals the show, and he probably will next Sunday night, when
Michael Smuin, former director of San Francisco Ballet, returns to his ABT
roots to perform the role. Coppelius also will be performed by Terrence Orr,
Gil Boggs and Victor Barbee.;    "La Bayadere" is a revival of Natalia
Makarova's staging, which when new was the first full-length production of
this classic Russian imperial ballet to be performed by a Western company. Its
showpiece is the opening of Act II, "The Kingdom of the Shades," whose slow,
repeated arabesques are a litmus test for the women of the corps. Many people
who know little about ballet will recognize this sequence, for it was the
image that ran beneath the title credits of the film "The Turning Point.";   
Guillem will dance the title role, with Kevin McKenzie as her lover and Susan
Jaffe as the wicked Gamzatti, April 5. Other casts are: Tcherkassky, Radojevic
and Harvey (April 6 matinee and April 7 evening); Jaffe, Ricardo Bustamante
and Leslie Browne (April 6); McKerrow, Chapman and Christine Dunham (April 7
matinee).;    The company's mixed repertory has been kept reasonably compact
for this tour: two programs, with one alteration in the second.;    The first,
to be seen Tuesday and Wednesday, includes Balanchine's "Ballet Imperial," a
tribute to the Russian tradition, set to Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1;
Mark Morris' "Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes," a beautiful company
showpiece, which replaces Tippet's unfinished ballet; and Jiri Kylian's
setting of Leos Janacek's virile "Sinfonietta.";    The second, to be seen
April 2-4, includes Sir Kenneth MacMillan's "Concerto," to music of Dmitri
Shostakovich; and Twyla Tharp's "Brief Fling." On April 2 and 4, the program
will include "Fall River Legend," Agnes de Mille's dramatic retelling of the
Lizzie Borden story; on April 3, the program will finish with Act II (the swan
scene) of "Swan Lake," in David Blair's 1966 setting.;    Cynthia Gregory, who
often performs with San Jose Cleveland Ballet as a guest artist, will dance
the Swan Queen, with Peter Morrison as the Prince and Michael Owen as
Rothbart, the sorcerer. She will also play Lizzie in the April 4 performance
of "Fall River Legend." The cast for April 2 is yet to be announced.;   
Opening night of "Coppelia" is a benefit for ABT, with the top tickets priced
at $150-$200. For these special tickets, which include pre- and
post-performance events, call (212) 477-3030.;    The April 2 mixed-rep
performance is a benefit for six Bay Area AIDS relief agencies. Tickets are
$20-$500, available from (415) 621-6557. (box);  American Ballet Theater;
Opens: Tuesday; Through: April 7; Where: War Memorial Opera House, 301 Van

ABT'S BIRTHDAY BASH HITS THE ROAD

<P>
The massive party took place last month at the Metropolitan Opera House in New 
York when American Ballet Theatre celebrated its 50th birthday. No one 
pretended that the event was coherent, but a lot of push-button sentimentalists 
enjoyed the glitzy rituals. 
</P>
<P>
This, after all, was a very big socio-aesthetic deal. A good seat cost $1,200. 
The on-stage guest list included such bona fide ballerinas as Alicia Alonso 
(dancing in the face of dotage), Carla Fracci, Gelsey Kirkland and Natalia 
Makarova. Agnes de Mille contributed a few testy words. Twyla Tharp made a 
surprise appearance shoving a delirious danseur out of her epochal "Push." 
</P>
<P>
Only one beloved body was conspicuously missing. It belonged to Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, who had abandoned his company in the wake of a major managerial 
imbroglio. 
</P>
<P>
Whether his self-imposed absence made the collective heart grow fonder became a 
moot point. Fernando Bujones, a rival matinee idol, provided compensation of 
sorts, returning to the fold from which he had been ousted. Moreover, one could 
find distraction in home movies, production numbers, nostalgia indulgences and 
orgies of self-congratulation. 
</P>
<P>
Had all gone as planned, Los Angeles would have caught up with some 
manifestation of the anniversary festivities this summer. The projected ABT 
engagement at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was canceled, however, when the 
Music Center failed to reconcile an unfortunate booking dispute with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Ergo, the version of the historic event mustered Tuesday night at the War 
Memorial Opera House provided California with its only exposure to the great 
balletic bash. As the ever-perverse fates would have it, alas, this Gala didn't 
turn out to be particularly gala. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco got the economy-size road-show version. The top ticket fetched a 
paltry $250. The only live guest in sight was Makarova, who, having finally 
hung up her toe shoes, rambled through some charming, ultra-affectionate 
anecdotes. Not incidentally, Bujones had been promised by Jane Hermann, the new 
executive director, but he didn't show. 
</P>
<P>
Each half of the three-hour would-be extravaganza began with a razzle-dazzle 
overture energetically conducted by Jack Everly. Then came tantalizing -- and 
frustrating -- collages of film clips. Some were ancient and some recent, some 
rare and some commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
The often fuzzy, nearly subliminal images on the screen flitted forward and 
backward in time, reducing significant art to stream-of-consciousness snippets. 
The musical pastiches on the sound track sometimes forced the protagonists to 
dance to the wrong tune. The uncredited, hyperbolic narration, voiced-over by 
Peter Donat, proved notable neither for good grammar nor for good taste. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to show time, the company mustered a little bit of this, and a 
tiny bit of that. The dancers plucked highlights from highlights, strung 
together in willy-nilly chaos. Place the accent on nilly. 
</P>
<P>
The viewer was allowed no sense of context. No continuity. No edification. No 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
Turning 50, American Ballet Theatre turned to a slick collection of variety 
acts. The tone was flashy, the pace fast, fast, fast. Here was another fancy 
installment in the annals of balletic vaudeville, conceived and directed by 
Michael Smuin. 
</P>
<P>
Finding specific things to savor in the hippety-hop jumble seemed akin to 
picking the peanuts out of a box of Cracker Jack. One's hands got sticky, yet 
the rewards -- beyond indigestion -- remained small. 
</P>
<P>
The company performed chunklets of 25 repertory items frantically, and often 
well. Although Baryshnikov's dancers may not command instantly compelling 
personalities, they are strong technicians and careful stylists. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda McKerrow, sympathetically supported by Kevin McKenzie, floated 
exquisitely through a moment from Antony Tudor's "The Leaves Are Fading." 
Alessandra Ferri, sensitively partnered by John Gardner, arched poignantly amid 
the "Lindenduft" of Eliot Feld's "At Midnight," and ignored a chronically 
off-pitch mezzo-soprano in the process. Susan Jaffe, nobly seconded by Ricardo 
Bustamante, exuded lyric refinement as the White Swan. 
</P>
<P>
Johan Renvall glittered as the Bronze Idol of "La Bayadere." Julio Bocca 
gobbled space ferociously as Solor, and Cynthia Harvey breathed refinement as 
his Gamzatti. Martine van Hamel defined Petipa grandeur as Raymonda. Cynthia 
Gregory, the obvious audience favorite, sustained the poetic balances of the 
Rose Adagio even better in the flesh than she had on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
No one, unfortunately, had a chance to establish a serious interpretive 
statement. There was no time to set, much less develop, a specific mood. 
Everything and everyone passed in a pretty blink. 
</P>
<P>
The choreography of "La Sylphide" melted into "Giselle," which blurred into 
"The Sleeping Beauty." Tudor got scrambled, Baryshnikov got slighted, and, 
inexplicably, Clark Tippet got snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, Smuin &amp; Co. trivialized Balanchine's "Theme and Variations," 
transforming the elegant finale into a motley costume parade. This act of 
violence heralded the arrival of tinsel streamers, balloons and curtain calls 
for the anonymous administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The applause wasn't deafening.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Dance:
   Baryshnikov Repudiated
   ----
   By Dale Harris

</SO>
<LP>
   New York -- According to the power press here, American
Ballet Theatre currently is in the process of "reclaiming its
soul." "Soul," of course, has never been easy to define.
However, in this case it probably signifies little more than
the state of bliss in which, according to some, ABT existed
before 1980. That year Mikhail Baryshnikov took over as
director from Lucia Chase and Oliver Smith and, many believe,
betrayed the company's spirit.
   Among those who subscribe to this view of ABT's recent
history, it would appear, are Jane Hermann and Oliver Smith,
the team that supplanted Mr. Baryshnikov last year.
Apparently forgetting that Mr. Baryshnikov was brought in to
rescue ABT from the artistic chaos to which his immediate
predecessors had reduced it, Ms. Hermann and Mr. Smith now
are busy trying to dismantle his accomplishments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To this end, they have repudiated Mr. Baryshnikov's
attempts to create a genuine ensemble in place of what was
essentially a showcase for visiting stars; his efforts to
extend the company's artistic reach by engaging modern-dance
choreographers such as Merce Cunningham, Twyla Tharp, Karole
Armitage and Mark Morris; his partiality for the ballets of
George Balanchine; his determination to place greater
emphasis on classical than on demi-caractere dancing. While
there hasn't been enough time for the new administration to
eradicate all evidence of its predecessor's taste -- the
general outlines of ABT's current season at the Metropolitan
Opera House were devised by Mr. Baryshnikov before his
precipitous departure -- the artistic orientation of Ms.
Hermann and Mr. Smith has begun to manifest itself.
   For one thing, guest artists, abjured for the most part
since 1980, are again very much in evidence. Fernando
Bujones, who left ABT after a disagreement with Mr.
Baryshnikov, returned for "Black Swan," "Giselle" and "The
Sleeping Beauty." In the last, he partnered Ludmila
Semenyaka, flown in from the U.S.S.R. at short notice to
replace an injured Cynthia Gregory. Ekaterina Maximova and
Vladimir Vasiliev, from the Bolshoi, danced a single
"Giselle," and Ms. Maximova also performed Mr. Vasiliev's
brief "Elegie."
   None of these appearances were exactly satisfying: Ms.
Maximova, after all, is 51, and Mr. Vasiliev 50. Mr. Bujones,
though merely 35, also has passed his zenith. As for Ms.
Semenyaka, her dancing is only too clearly characterized by
the unmusicality and technical weaknesses of Leningrad's
Kirov, where she began her career, and the affectations of
Moscow's Bolshoi, where she is the ranking ballerina.
   Whether or not such guests are good for the box office is
far from certain. That they are bad for the company's
artistic standing can hardly be doubted. Not only do they
undermine what remains of the stylistic coherence Mr.
Baryshnikov was trying to instill into ABT, they also serve
to derogate the importance of choreography. Like the old
duumvirate, the new one prefers to promote the cult of
personality over the art of dance. To see the shambles Ms.
Semenyaka made of the text -- not to mention the spirit -- of
"The Sleeping Beauty" should be warning enough of the dire
consequences of casting by publicity value instead of
capability. Ms. Maximova and Mr. Vasiliev are artistically
far superior to Ms. Semenyaka, but they have little to offer
a company in desperate need of aesthetic direction.
   Ms. Maximova and Mr. Vasiliev at least excited the
audience, many of whom, no doubt, remembered the pair from
their days of glory. Ms. Semenyaka, on the other hand, left
the house cold. So, invariably, does the company's newly
engaged premier danseur Faruk Ruzimatov, formerly of the
Kirov Ballet. Mr. Ruzimatov made his New York debut with the
company in "Giselle," followed two weeks later by "Bayadere,
Act II." Both roles cruelly expose his technical weakness.
They also expose his lack of magnetism.
   It's true that the very first sight of him is enough to
produce gasps from the audience, an expectant hush, a round
of applause. But, then, few dancers at ABT have ever adopted
so startlingly tragic a demeanor, kept their mouths so
constantly open, as if in perpetual self-astonishment, or
worn such heavy eye makeup. It's when Mr. Ruzimatov starts to
dance that the enthusiasm dwindles -- as it noticeably did on
both occasions.
   In Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" and, especially,
"Stravinsky Violin Concerto," Mr. Ruzimatov fell even
flatter. The technical demands made by abstract works like
these cannot be finessed by adopting an air of tragic
suffering -- as to some extent they can be in certain
narrative or situational ballets -- and the Soviet dancer was
forced to simplify the steps in a way that sabotaged the
choreographer's patent intentions. In "Stravinsky Violin
Concerto," there was a certain amount of diversion in seeing
someone so completely out of place -- Mr. Ruzimatov danced
this bracingly astringent work as if he were thinking about
the Last Judgment -- but that was hardly enough to save the
performance. The engagement of the ex-Kirov dancer looks all
too symptomatic of the new directors' inability to see where
their priorities lie. Instead of ensuring that the talented
dancers already in the company are properly nurtured, they
prefer to scour the U.S.S.R. for a possible box-office
sensation, whether the dancer in question is good or bad.
   Among those on ABT's regular roster in need of guidance is
Julio Bocca, a premier danseur of remarkable talent but with
little idea of how to put it to proper use. Playing opposite
the touching and musical Alessandra Ferri in "Giselle," he
took fire. Playing in "The Sleeping Beauty" opposite the
callow, unfocused Amanda McKerrow -- another immensely gifted
dancer badly in need of help -- he looked lost, even missing
the crucial cue, announced so thrillingly in Tchaikovsky's
music, that signals the awakening of Aurora and the
restoration of life to the entire kingdom.
   As it happens, the entire production of Petipa's greatest
work looked slack and, like so much seen during the current
season, under-rehearsed. Certainly, in this latter respect
the company is returning all too evidently to the level that
prevailed under Lucia Chase and Oliver Smith, when survival
took precedence over quality. Survival, of course, is not a
negligible consideration. On the other hand, it is hardly a
guarantee of excellence -- and excellence is surely the only
standard a ballet company ought to be aspiring to.

   Dance: ABT Plays It Safe

   New York -- Lucia Chase and Oliver Smith ran American
Ballet Theatre from 1945 until 1980, in which year the board
summarily replaced them with Mikhail Baryshnikov. After the
latter in turn fell from power in 1989, Mr. Smith was
reinstated. His co-director this time was Jane Hermann, an
efficient manager with no evident artistic qualifications.
Had Ms. Chase not died three years earlier, it's possible
that the company would today be ruled by a triumvirate, so
eager was the board to restore ABT's pre-Baryshnikov
identity. Still, Ms. Chase, looking down on Lincoln Center
from her present abode, must feel vindicated. Except for a
detail here and there, the ABT season currently in progress
at the Metropolitan Opera House is one that she herself might
have devised.
   Certainly, the Met engagement makes no pretensions to
seriousness. Under Ms. Hermann and Mr. Smith, ABT has once
again become a company with a single agenda: survival. Forget
art. Forget innovation and daring. Forget the fact that
classical ballet is a discipline whose unbreakable connection
to a long and fruitful tradition implies the need for
constant selfrenewal. Concentrate instead on what is
over-familiar, unchallenging, even retrogressive. At the Met,
the only conviction in evidence is that safety might just
save the day.

   All but one of this season's premieres -- most, at the
time of writing, still to come -- have been taken down from
the company's attic. For example, though it has been
publicized as a novelty, the production of "Coppelia" that
opened the New York season is nothing but a refurbished
version of ABT's witless old "Coppelia" tricked out in new
costumes by Patricia Zipprodt and new sets by Tony Straiges,
a protege and former pupil of Mr. Smith. The re-stagings of
both "Raymonda, Act 3" by Fernando Bujones and of "Don
Quixote" by Vladimir Vasiliev are being presented in their
original, unsatisfactory sets and costumes. On its way is a
revival of Sir Kenneth Macmillan's anodyne "Concerto." The
only work originating from outside the company, Jiri Kylian's
"Sinfonietta," was created 13 years ago for Netherlands Dance
Theatre and is an example of Euroschlock at its most
wearisomely familiar.
   Missing entirely is new choreography. In place of
creativity, however, there are guest artists. These, banished
under Mr. Baryshnikov, who wanted to strengthen ABT from the
inside, have now become what they were in the Chase-Smith
era: a desperate expedient on the part of a company convinced
it has little of its own to offer the public. Like this
season's novelties, most of the visiting celebrities come
from ABT's attic: Mr. Bujones, Cynthia Gregory and Carla
Fracci, the last in her mid-50s and increasingly
circumscribed by enervation and understandable reticence. Her
performance in Antony Tudor's now inert "Lilac Garden" was
unobtrusive to the point of mousiness.
   There is, however, one youthful guest performer, Sylvie
Guillem. Though she lacks the ability to connect individual
steps into a continuum, Ms. Guillem possesses a gymnastic
suppleness that to undiscriminating eyes can pass for
virtuosity. With the right kind of hype, she may prove as
much an audience draw in New York as she has already in
London, where she is a permanent guest artist with the Royal
Ballet. Certainly, ABT needs something to engender
excitement, a quality the season has so far lacked. Sad to
say, none of the company's regulars has the kind of glamour
that creates lines at the box office.
   All the same, there are some fine dancers on the roster.
One of these is Julio Bocca, a performer whose ebullience and
technical proficiency carry him with success through a number
of extrovert roles. Despite being somewhat short in stature
and top-heavy in physique, he makes a winning impression,
though, as the opening-night "Coppelia" revealed, it isn't
that of a major performer. Badly in need of artistic
direction -- as hard to find at ABT these days as it used to
be in the days before Mr. Baryshnikov took over -- he mugged
incessantly and tried to dazzle the audience with a show of
virtuosity just beyond his reach.
   Possibly, he was attempting to compensate for the disaster
taking place around him, the elements of which included
Cheryl Yaeger's charmless, determinedly roguish Swanilda and
Terry Orr's Dr. Coppelius, a portrayal in which tired old
sight gags took the place of characterization. There was,
however, some relief in the engaging performances by Julie
Kent as Prayer and by Kathleen Moore and Roger Van Fleteren,
who led the corps de ballet in the act-one mazurka with
admirable zest.
   Bright spots notwithstanding, the overall effect of this
"Coppelia" was disheartening. By hiring Enrique Martinez to
resuscitate his 1968 staging, the directorate ensured that
the company got a "Coppelia" without either sweetness or
effervescence. Bad as the old version was, though, the new
one is worse, if only because it is bigger and cruder.
Remnants of the original 1870 version by Arthur Saint-Leon,
as well as that mounted in St. Petersburg 14 years later by
Marius Petipa, are now embedded in a production that aspires
to the condition of knockabout farce. The scene in act three
featuring a money-hungry Catholic priest has been amplified
and further coarsened to a point of acute embarrassment.
Where Mr. Martinez has created his own choreography, as in
the last-act solos and ensembles, the result is oppressive.
   Oppressive, too, is the scenery. Mr. Straiges's folksy and
ill-drawn set for the first and third acts is banal to a
point of invisibility. In what looks like an attempt to give
it some substance, the designer has surrounded it with a
wide, dark-green border, a heavy-handed device at odds with
the buoyant music of Delibes. The set for act two, similarly
bordered, looks like an hommage to New York City Ballet's
production of the same work. Ms. Zipprodt's costumes are as
ungainly and miscellaneous in approach as those she supplied
for NYCB's recent "Sleeping Beauty." The trouser-suits she
has given to the peasants in act one are unfortunately
memorable. So are her tutus, the proper cut of which she
doesn't seem to have grasped. What has befallen American
stage design? The same disaster, apparently, that has
befallen ABT.

   The first Hans Christian Andersen
Ballet Performance Awards were presented Saturday during an
international performance at the Danish Royal Theater.
   Top awards went to Sylvie Guillem of the Paris Opera Ballet and
Irek Mukhamedov of the Soviet's Bolshoi Ballet.
   Ms. Guillem won the award for the best female performance in her
role as Odile-Odette in ``Swan Lake.'' Mukhamedov was selected as
best male performer for the role as ``Spartacus''.
   They were selected from dancers nominated by 38 ballet companies
in 22 countries.
   The H.C. Andersen Choreography Award was presented to Jiri
Kylian, artistic director of the Netherlands Dance Theater for his
choreography of ``L'Enfent et les Sortileges.'' Three Awards of
Merit were announced. They went to Frederick Ashton, leader of the
London Royal Ballet, and to Jerome Robbins and Peter Martins,
co-directors of the New York City Ballet.
   Dancers from various ballet troupes performed Saturday night.
   Ms. Guillem and Manuel Legris of the Paris Opera Ballet danced
the ``Grand Pas Classique.'' The Bolshoi's Mukhamedov and Natalia
Bessmertnova performed an excerpt from ``Spartacus.''
   Two dancers from the Beijing Ballet, Li Ying and Pang Jiabin,
presented a section of August Bournonville's ``The Flower Festival
at Genzano.''
   Cheryl Yeager and Julio Bocca of the American Ballet Theater
performed the pas de deux from ``Don Quixote''.
   The awards are named after fairy-tale master Hans Christian
Andersen. He was a friend of Bournonville, the famed 19th century
Danish choreographer.
   Many of Anderson's tales were the inspiration for ballets. For a
few years, he was a member of the ballet corps at the Danish Royal
Opera but was dismissed on grounds that his feet were too big.
   The awards are to be presented annually.

   A University of Oregon senior faces a
contempt of court charge for enclosing a letter with a parking fine
in which he complained in mostly vulgar terms about having to pay.
   Jeffrey Sebastian, 23, said he was angry about the fine because
he received the parking ticket while taking a required exam. He
suggested, in a letter peppered mostly with profanities, that the
city should coordinate parking with the school when exams are
scheduled.
   ``The emotion did slip,'' Sebastian said about the letter, which
he claims is an expression of constitutionally protected free
speech. ``But that doesn't change the feelings that I felt.''
   After Municipal Judge Frank Bocci read the letter, he ordered
Sebastian to show cause why he shouldn't be held in contempt ``for
disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the judge and
court.''
   Now Sebastian faces the prospect of a $25 fine or 10 days in jail.
   ``I felt it was offensive to the proper judicial operation of the
court and to what's referred to as the dignity of the court,'' Bocci
said this week. He added that it was the first time in 24 years on
the bench that he's issued a contempt citation against someone for
writing a letter.
   The case was heard this week by Pro Tem Judge Jim Spickerman
after Bocci disqualified himself from the case to avoid any bias.
   Floyd Prozanski Jr., a city prosecutor, admitted there were no
Oregon cases dealing with the issue but he cited cases in New Jersey
that appeared to offer some guidance.
   However, defense attorney Steve Chez cited another New Jersey
case that concluded with a pair of rhyming couplets:
   ``Statutory attempts to regulate pure bluster,
   Can't pass what is called constitutional muster.
   Use of vulgar words that may cause resentment,
   Is protected by the First Amendment.''
   A decision is expected next week.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League representative </F>
Gianfranco Miglio by Guido Passalacqua in Milan; date not given: 
"Miglio Throws In the Towel: `No Hope for Italy'"] 
  [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] [Passalacqua] 
Professor, Bossi is abandoning federalism in order to attract 
the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. What do you think of that? 
  [Miglio] I do not criticize him. I go even further. The 
stance that he adopted recently has released certain 
uncertainties that I have nurtured for the past six months. We 
will never succeed in introducing a federalist Constitution in 
Italy. The North has been tainted by the South, which expects, 
and wants nothing more than, a welfare state. There is nothing 
to be done about it; that is the way the Italian people are, and 
that goes for me too. My friends in the League have not 
succeeded in doing anything to curb this tendency; they have 
merely been able to provide some kind of response to people's 
protests. 
  [Passalacqua] Was this all expected? Were you not the author 
of the Assago blueprint, which envisaged an Italy cut up into 
pieces? 
  [Miglio] The institutions of the First Republic were the 
only 
ones suited to the Italians who were comfortable in that state, 
and who remain so. 
  [Passalacqua] Which is why Bossi is turning toward 
regionalism... 
  [Miglio] Regionalism will not alter the situation much, 
because even if it is implemented, it will merely increase the 
influence of the welfare state... 
  [Passalacqua] So the federalism thrown out of the door will 
come back in through the window... 
  [Miglio] Yes, it is the only blueprint that enables Italy to 
be a respectable state. Now, however, I realize that I made a 
mistake, like inspector Rock on that television commercial many 
years ago. To have imagined a different order for Italy -- the 
federal order. The fact is that only a terrible economic and 
financial crisis could lead to federalism, but I really do not 
hope for such an end. 
  [Passalacqua] You seem embittered, professor. 
  [Miglio] A political scientist must tell the truth. I am a 
realist. 
  [Passalacqua] Does your realism now prompt you to say 
farewell to Parliament? 
  [Miglio] I am thinking about it, but this is not my foremost 
thought. I will stay on only if it is possible to change the 
system, but I am sure that there is nothing that can be done. 
  [Passalacqua] So are you totally pessimistic? 
  [Miglio] The system seems to me unchangeable. Despite all 
its defects and misdeeds. 
  [Passalacqua] Why? 
  [Miglio] From within, I can see the real nature of the 
Italian people who have always enjoyed excessive welfare 
benefits and are therefore unable to engage in a market economy. 
Do you know what I am going to tell you? We should not have 
signed the Maastricht Treaty, since we will be forced to violate 
them. 
  [Passalacqua] You are saying farewell to politics, and think 
that it is impossible to change anything. At the same time 
Bossi is seeking agreements with [Pact for Italy ideologue] 
Buttiglione, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, and [Rooting for 
Italy leader] Berlusconi. It is legitimate to suspect that 
there is no complete concordance of views between you.... 
  [Miglio] Once again it is I who am imparting a profound 
significance to Bossi's options. If my analysis is correct, all 
this feverish activity on the part of the liberal democratic 
alignment is a waste of time. 
  [Passalacqua] Is it your realism that prompts you to bury 
the 
alignment for freedom even before it is born? 
  [Miglio] Indeed, the left-wing alignment will win. 
  [Passalacqua] Is there no hope? 
  [Miglio] Berlusconi and Segni are very likely to lose, short 
of a miracle. 
  [Passalacqua] Do you think the same about Berlusconi as 
[resigning IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli does? 
  [Miglio] Montanelli is a cynic; I am a skeptic. 
  [Passalacqua] But whom do you side with in the dispute 
between Montanelli and Berlusconi? 
  [Miglio] If I were a newspaper publisher, I would expect the 
editor to follow my general line. 
  [Passalacqua] Professor, how does the League regard the 
situation? 
  [Miglio] The League is fine. 
  [Passalacqua] Before Assago you used to describe Bossi as a 
crazy bruiser. What about now? 
  [Miglio] He is fine. 
  [Passalacqua] Many interpret your remarks as not very veiled 
criticisms of Bossi. 
  [Miglio] Utter nonsense. 
  [Passalacqua] Would you kindly give us your description of 
Bossi. 
  [Miglio] A great extemporizing leader with a great intuition 
with respect to political phenomena. 
  [Passalacqua] You said "extemporizing." For some time there 
has been increasing criticism of Bossi's oscillations. In LA 
REPUBBLICA yesterday, Giorgio Bocca said that if you fool around 
too much in politics you will suffer a pratfall.... 
  [Miglio] A large number of people vote for the League 
because 
that is the way Bossi is. 
  [Passalacqua] But the phenomenon of rejection does exist; it 
cannot be denied. 
  [Miglio] These things will undergo the acid test in the 
elections. I read Bocca's charges against Bossi: He said that 
we lack a strong program focus. He regrets the passing of 
localism. But, you see, when we were localists we were 
criticized. The League, remember, has always found a political 
identity in the electoral melting pot. Bossi thinks up the 
watchwords and points of policy at public rallies. So, my dear 
Bocca, have no fear. When the right moment comes, political 
identities will emerge. 
  [Passalacqua] Bocca said that the League is finished as a 
major political force. 
  [Miglio] Nonsense. Right now I do not think that the only 
option is to vote for the League. People know that we deserve 
their votes.

<HEAD>Former Football Player Awarded $11.2 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has concluded that a defective
football helmet allowed a former high school athlete to suffer a
severe brain injury and has awarded the young man $11.2 million.
   The helmet made by the Bike Athletic Co. was unreasonably
dangerous, leading to acute bleeding within the brain of Richard
Austria, then 16, a Multnomah County Circuit Court jury decided
Monday in an 11-1 vote.
   Austria, now 20, has severe, irreversible mental and physical
impairments and requires 24-hour care.
   It apparently was the first time that an injury case involving a
Bike helmet has been presented to a jury. Bike has been in the
helmet business since 1976.
   Mark R. Bocci, an attorney for Austria and his parents, John and
Perla Austria, said several other cases against Bike had been
settled out of court without disclosure of payments.
   Bocci and James M. Pippin, also representing the Austrias,
contended that the Bike Air Power model helmet worn by Austria had
not been adequately tested before the company marketed it.
   Bike and the Kendall Research Center, which tested helmets for
Bike, are both liable for damages. Both are subsidiaries of
Colgate-Palmolive Corp.
   Charles Peery, a Seattle lawyer for Bike, told jurors last week
that helmets similar to the one worn by Austria are used by 80
percent of the players in the Northwest and Alaska, from junior
high school teams to professionals.
   The Air Power model contains a bladder at the crown of the
helmet that is inflated with air. Other padding includes foam
strips, called sizers, that come in various sizes.
   Lawyers for the Austrias contended that the Air Power model for
large heads did not meet national testing standards, although
smaller helmets did pass the tests. They said detailed company
testing records were blank between 1981 and 1984.
   Peery argued that no helmet could eliminate the risk of a
subdural hematoma, bleeding in the brain caused by a blow, and
contended there was no proof that a football injury caused
Austria's hematoma.
   Peery said Austria had ignored advice from his physician not to
play football while he suffered headaches.
   Jurors concluded that Austria was 2 percent at fault, thus
reducing the total award of damages from $11.40 million to $11.19
million. Bocci said Austria would need $5.2 million to provide for
daily care the rest of his life.
   William Mitchell, a Portland lawyer representing Bike, said
there was a strong chance of an appeal.

<HEAD>Communists Suffer Sharp Setback In Local Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian voters dealt the new-look Communist Party a
sharp setback in regional and provincial elections, while groups
seeking greater local autonomy made surprising gains, according to
results released today.
   ``Earthquake at the polls,'' said the national daily La
Repubblica after the Lega Lombarda, a regional political party in
the Milan area, won 19 percent of the votes, outpolling the
Communists in the wealthy industrial region.
   Results from the voting Sunday and Monday confirmed the early
trends showing the Communists, who had come to the brink of power a
decade ago, getting no more than 24 percent of the vote.
   The Communists, Italy's No. 2 party, won 30 percent of the vote
in the last regional elections in 1985 and 27.8 percent in
parliamentary voting in 1987.
   The Christian Democrats, who have led or dominated all national
governments for four decades, suffered small losses and held on to
about a third of the total votes.
   The Socialists, Italy's No. 3 party, advanced, but with 15
percent of the vote were still a long way from overtaking the
Communists.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti, a Christian Democrat, warned during
the campaign that major shifts in the voting could cause his
coalition government to collapse. The coalition also includes the
Socialists and three tiny parties: Republicans, Social Democrats
and Liberals.
   But commentators said the results didn't appear to pose major
risks for the coalition.
   However, the results were a disappointment for the Communists,
who adopted a ``new course'' at an extraordinary congress in March
in an effort to halt the party's steady electoral decline since the
early 1980s and react to the democratic upheavals sweeping
Communist parties from power in Eastern Europe.
   At their congress, the Communists gave party leader Achille
Occhetto a mandate to restructure the party to try to unite Italy's
fractured left. This would eventually entail changing the party's
name and hammer-and-sickle symbol.
   The proposals were opposed by the party's old guard leaders, who
saw them as a denial of the party's history and roots.
   ``The new course didn't stop the hemorrhage of votes that has
gone on since 1984,'' said the leading Milan newspaper Corriere
della Sera.
   The biggest gains were made by the Lega Lombarda and similar
locally oriented groups in the north.
   These groups have been accused of prejudice toward Italians from
the south and immigrants from the Third World who have come to the
more prosperous north seeking work.
   But the Lega has denied the charge, saying its aim is to reduce
the power of the central government in local matters.
   ``The racist leagues advance,'' headlined Rome's Il Messaggero.
   But Giorgio Bocca, a La Repubblica columnist, said the
mainstream parties would be making a serious error to underplay the
reasons for the success of the new groups.
   ``This is the reaction to a policy which has led to the
bankruptcy of the public administration and handed large areas of
the south to the underworld,'' Bocca wrote.
   Umberto Bossi, leader of the Lega Lombarda, said its success in
becoming the second-largest party in Lombardy exceeded its
expectations.
   ``This is the first step toward our final goal of federalism, to
reduce the power of the central government.''
   Up for election were 15 of 20 regional governments, 87
provincial governing councils and 6,374 city governments. City
elections were not held in such major centers as Rome, Naples,
Trieste, Catania and Bolzano.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Dance: Morris Making His Mark </HL>
<AUTHOR> Dale Harris </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   If the New York City Ballet's recent American Music Festival did little enough for American music, it did even less for American choreography, which, as commissioned -- and partly created -- by Peter Martins, made a thoroughly dismal showing. 
All the more heartening, therefore, to find exactly the qualities absent from that meaningless celebration in the work recently given its world premiere by American Ballet Theater: Mark Morris's "Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes." 

   In this piece, choreographed to Virgil Thomson's "Etudes for Piano" -- finely played by Michael Boriskin -- Mr. Morris uses music as the starting point for a serious and exciting exploration of movement. 
Everything about the work, moreover, bespeaks its American provenance. 
As a choreographer, Mr. Morris is the heir of two great American traditions: classical ballet and modern dance. 

   Though its roots are French, Italian and Russian, classical ballet as we know it in this country is the result of redefinition by George Balanchine, who, fascinated by the athleticism of American dancers, extended its range accordingly. 
Modern dance, on the other hand, originated here; it is an art that descends from the example of Isadora Duncan, the earliest great nonconformist in the field. 

   While the two traditions are no longer considered antithetical, they retain their distinctiveness. 
Ballet tends to impersonal beauty, modern dance to emotional resonance; the first to formal perfection, the second to idiosyncrasy, freedom from rules, self-justification. 
Ballet, in addition, aspires to the aerial. 
Modern dance draws strength from a constantly affirmed relationship to the terrestrial. 
An important part of Mr. Morris's significance is his ability to draw from both traditions and, in so doing, to restore their vitality. 

   In the case of classical ballet, the need for renewal is urgent, too urgent, indeed, to be conceived of in unrealizable, messianic terms. 
We await not so much another George Balanchine as an influx of dance invention that can take the art forward from where he left it at his death. 
The choreography that could save ballet from inanition will have to be at once classical in formulation and daring in sensibility. 
In "Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes," Mr. Morris uses the classical vocabulary with fluency and eloquence. 
He also uses it with freedom that comes from his skill in modern dance forms. 

   Nowhere is his mastery as a ballet maker more evident than in his handling of the music. 
Virgil Thomson's "Etudes," at once straightforward and complex, gives the dancers impetus, even a sense of style; it does not force them into an inflexible mode of behavior. 
They take their cue from the music's moods, its ebullience and tender reflectiveness, but in ways that preserve their individuality as performers. 
With the stage darkened and the piano (amplified) far upstage, the cast of 12 enter and quickly disappear like dream visions. 
In their dancing, they combine games with the rigors of classroom exercises, revealing not only their physical prowess but also their social and comradely grace. 
The impression they make is frankly dazzling. 
There is no finer classical dancing to be seen anywhere today. 

   For various reasons, the cast has been shuffled around from performance to performance, but never to the ballet's disadvantage. 
The dancers I saw over the course of three evenings were all excellent: Cynthia Anderson, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Shawn Black, Julio Bocca, Deirdre Carberry, Robert Hill, Susan Jaffe, Carld Jonassaint, Lucette Katerndahl, Kathleen Moore, Isabella Padovani, Keith Roberts, Martine van Hamel, Robert Wallace and Ross Yearsley. 
When Mr. Wallace took over from the temporarily indisposed Mr. Baryshnikov, there was no loss of brilliance or charm, only an intriguing change of focus. 
Obviously, all ABT needs to make it look like a great company, as it emphatically does in this ballet, is choreography that takes the dancers seriously. 

   Mr. Morris has been doing just that with great frequency of late. 
During the intriguingly diverse program given last month at Brooklyn Academy of Music by the Mark Morris Dance Group, the emphasis was very much on the modern. 
The performers, strong, athletic, widely divergent in body type, were barefoot, thus establishing their fundamental connection with the earth even when in the air. 
At the end of "New Love Song Waltzes," set to the second set of Brahms's "Liebeslieder Walzer," all of the dancers were clustered together on the floor, with one dancer in their midst swaying like a plant under water. 
As she sank slowly down to join the others -- and in the instant before the curtain fell -- another rose from their midst, like an assertion of the individual will. 

   In "Fugue," set to Mozart's Fugue in C minor, K.475, two men and two women wearing old-fashioned swimsuits perform a dance of comic desperation while seated on chairs lined up across the front of the stage. 
The chairs save them from complete disintegration. 
Though as their emotions intensify they get to their feet and move, often convulsively, around them, they continually return to their seats. 
If, as seems likely, the piece was designed as a satire on a certain kind of currently fashionable, "Angst"-ridden European choreography, it is less concerned with mockery than with the close observation of basic human feelings -- such as anger, apprehension, jealousy -- which it both enlarges and intensifies. 
It is also concerned with the violence implicit in Mozart's music and the highly wrought formality that at once controls and expresses it. 

   The only good news about European choreography is the fact that, next September, Mark Morris and his dancers are going to move their operations from Seattle to the Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels, where they will replace the company of Maurice Bejart. 
One has but to think of the debased state of dance over there -- William Forsythe in Frankfurt, John Neumeier in Hamburg, Rudolf Nureyev in Paris, David Bintley in London, Pina Bausch in Wuppertal, not to mention the egregious Mr. Bejart, now in Lausanne -- to understand what the move could mean for trans-Atlantic dance. 
Meanwhile, though, we may ask what will happen to dance back here, where the facilities Brussels has offered Mr. Morris, including a $1.5 million annual budget, are apparently not to be thought of. 
Clearly, some reordering of our priorities is called for.

<P>
A former high school football player has been awarded $11.2 million from a jury 
that concluded a defective football helmet caused him to suffer a severe brain 
injury four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A helmet made by the Bike Athletic Co. was unreasonably dangerous, leading to 
acute bleeding within the brain of Richard Austria, then 16, a Multnomah County 
Circuit Court jury decided Monday in an 11-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The damage award is the largest in Multnomah County court history and 
apparently marks the first time that an injury case involving a Bike helmet has 
been presented to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors concluded that the Richard Austria,a reserve defensive back, was 2% at 
fault, thus reducing the total award of damages from $11.40 million to $11.19 
million. Bocci said Austria would need $5.2 million to provide for daily care 
the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irreversible Damage 
</P>
<P>
Austria, now 20, has severe, irreversible mental and physical impairments after 
suffering an acute subdural hematoma Oct. 1, 1985. He has been living with his 
parents but requires 24-hour care. 
</P>
<P>
William Mitchell, a Portland lawyer representing Bike, declined to comment on 
the outcome other than to say, "It was an emotional case." He said there is a 
strong chance of an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bocci and James M. Pippin, representing the Austria and his parents, 
contended that the Bike Air Power model helmet worn by Austria had not been 
adequately tested before the company marketed it.

FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: Frank Andersen's Jubilee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They do these things wonderfully well in Copenhagen. The ballet matters a
great deal; dancers and choreographers are public figures - a postage stamp
bore the portrait of the great Danish ballerina Margrethe Schanne - and the
fortunes of the Royal Danish Ballet are of national concern.
Frank Andersen has directed the company for the past nine years - he will
retire this summer - and this year celebrates his silver jubilee as a member
of the Ballet. So, on Saturday night, there was a gala to mark his 25 years
of service, and an occasion to thank him for his achievement as director.
It was a splendid occasion, with that mixture of formality and happy ease
which is one of the joys of the Royal Theatre. Queen Margrethe was in the
Royal Box, a reminder of vital patronage - she has provided admirable design
for that most national of Bournonville's works, A Folk Tale - and the
audience knew it was there for a family celebration. There was nothing too
serious, some nice jokes, wonderful dancing, and a merry determination to
get everyone possible on stage somehow or other.
Thus the last act of the company's new Sleeping Beauty showed us roles being
shared, sometimes in mid-variation. There were two pairs of Bluebirds - with
Alexander Kolpin and Thomas Lund very buoyant - three Auroras and three
Princes, so that Yury Posokhov and Lloyd Riggins played catch-as-catch-can
in the Prince's solo and were tremendous.
It is one of the strengths of the Royal Danes that a career will start in
childhood - peering and cheering from the bridge in the last act of Napoli -
and continue well into autumnal years with rewarding character roles that
include Napoli's lemonade and macaroni sellers. So the children of the
ballet school came to salute Andersen (who is, officially, Royal Ballet
Master) and danced featly to the adorable rattle of the Polka Militaire,
which was composed for Bournonville in 1842.
Then we moved into the gala sweetmeats. There was new Danish choreography
with part of Anna Laerkesen's Whispers and Floating; John Neumeier's
Adagietto from Mahler 5 for Mette Ida Kirk and Yury Posokhov; Nina
Ananiashvili and Julio Bocca flashing through Don Quixote's flaming paper
hoops; Elisabeth Platel and Manuel Legris in Balanchine's delicate, allusive
response to Ravel's Sonatine - exquisite, subtle, both in ideas and
performance.
And of course, to finish with, came the crack of muskets, tambourines, and
the flash of Bournonville steps in the last act of Napoli. This is, because
of Bournonville's love of the theatre, his moral dignity, his belief in the
joyous nature of dancing, his power to capture the life of his time,
quintessentially Danish - not least in its response to southern light.
There were the ballet children on the bridge, and such eminent artists as
Niels Kehlet sitting at the cafe tables. There were the buoyant lines of
male dancers - young Johan Kobborg bounding through a solo like the spirit
of Bournonville - and the bewitching legion of the girls. And there, as the
hero, Gennaro, was Frank Andersen, still nifty as to step (he is, after all,
only 41 years old) and leading his entire company in these ever-fresh,
eternally sparkling ensembles.
We clapped and cheered. The children on the bridge waved and shouted. The
dancers cheered. Andersen, with the sincerity and charm that has marked his
dancing and his direction of the troupe, took his bows and the presents
brought on for him, and his laurels, saluted his monarch, and was rightly
moved near to tears. The applause went on for ever.

<TEXT>     After he came to America in 1955, he tried working for Central Concrete
Supply in San Jose, but his boss told him he needed to get into a business
that would take advantage of his built-in family workforce.;   So he tried
pumping gas, running a Mohawk station in Scotts Valley and later a Douglas
station in Santa Cruz.;   Still, there were his daughters. "That left us girls
out," said Maria Jorgensen, one of the seven. "Sure, I changed tires, but . .
.;   "So my dad looked at opening a business that could accommodate both sexes
equally.";   Food filled the bill.;   When Andrea "Papa Z" Zanotto died
Wednesday at a San Jose hospital at the age of 81, all of his children and
many of their spouses and children at one time or another had worked in the
family's two markets and one restaurant. More than 20 still do.;   "My father
tried to prove to his children that life is not meaningful without the desire
to work hard," said his daughter, Liz Caffrey.;   And Papa Z set the example.
First, he acquired the Thrifty Market at Hedding and Springer, but it burned
down, and was in the San Jose International Airport's flight path, so he
couldn't rebuild.;   Family members opened what they call Store No. 1,
Zanotto's Deluxe Market at Naglee and Bascom avenues in San Jose. Store No. 2
and Zanotto's Pasta and More restaurant in Scotts Valley and Store No. 3 in
Santa Cruz followed.;   Papa Z never took a vacation. He was always at the
store, Jorgensen said. He worked seven days a week.;   "It was his wont to go
in in the morning to make sure the store was clean and presentable," said
Caffrey's husband, Michael.;   Papa Z did take time to play a little bocce, as
a member of the Los Gatos Bocci Ball Association. And he belonged to the Holy
Spirit Catholic Church, the Italian Catholic Federation No. 919 and William
Paca Lodge of the Sons of Italy.;   But on June 27, when he suffered his
second, and eventually fatal, stroke, Papa Z was working at Store No. 1.;   It
clearly runs in the family: Papa Z's oldest son, Tony, who is athletic
director at Independence High School, also still works at Store No. 1.;   Papa
Z's wife of 54 years, Rosa, also still puts in four days a week in the San
Jose store's delicatessen.;   Why won't she quit? "What would she do with all
her spare time? she asks," Jorgensen said. "Mother's 74. She makes about 200
sandwiches a day."; Andrea Zanotto; (box)Born: March 2, 1910, Treviso, Italy.;

FT  11 MAR 93 / Arts: With spring in their steps / Review of young dancers
at the Paris Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dancer's life is short, and youthful promise has a nasty habit of fading
away, either by reason of neglect or because of the pressures within a
ballet company. The golden gift we saw at graduation - or thought we saw -
turns to some baser material as time passes, and occasional soloist roles
are the reward for what once seemed a talent to storm the heights. The Paris
Opera Ballet has in latter years set aside evenings in the Palais Garnier to
celebrate the potential of its youngest dancers, so that the Paris public
(always very partisan) may judge the gifted young, and the gifted young may
have moments of glory as a reward for talent, and a taste of greater rewards
to come.
The evenings are tremendously exciting. A clue to the Opera's dance style
lies in display, in assured prowess, in the assertion of 'moi'. Some years
ago, in Natalia Makarova's Ballerina series for BBC TV, shots of class at
the Opera superb Ballet School found the teacher urging her girls to show
plus de chic; beaucoup plus de chic. It is a phrase which sums up a lot
about attitudes at the school and in the company. Technique, the
presentation of the dance, is glossy, and has that wit which is an essential
component of chic. Russian young can look soulful (though sublime) by
comparison. Americans may appear hard-driven in attack; the English somewhat
demure. Most of the young French, if not all - as I saw on Saturday night -
take the stage with an allure that speaks of confidence and a clear sense of
their identity. At worst they are over-vivacious: at best they are
world-beaters.
The programme, given on three successive evenings, comprised pas de deux and
extracts from the repertory. All may not have been for the best all the time
 -a version of the Fairy variations from the Sleeping Beauty prologue did no
justice to Petipa, for the Russian classics lie outside the Opera's
traditions; Agon is not for the inexperienced - but the sum effect was of a
company (and a teaching tradition) marvellously rich.
There were several exceptional talents. A duet from Le Papillon with
Isabelle Ciavara (aged 20) and Emmanuel Thibault (just 18) was
heart-touching. Mlle Ciavara is slight, enchantingly pretty, and delights in
the intricacies of quick, clear, tiny steps: the old Russian ballerinas used
to call such choreography 'weaving lace with your feet'. Mlle Ciavara turns,
holds a floating pose, is sweetly true in this reconstruction of a mid-19th
century spectacle. M Thibault is of medium height - Baryshnikov, Julio
Bocca, his models - and already possessor of a beautifully rounded
technique. Marvels are easily done, but more enthralling is his ability to
devour space, to race and soar, and seem a meteor. Like Mlle Ciaravola, his
manner is still innocent; I long to see them both in Coppelia.
A grand contrast came with Aurelie Dupont in Balanchine's Tchaikovsky pas de
deux. Winner of the junior gold medal in last year's Varna Ballet
Competition, she has an all-conquering skill, but it is allied to a
lusciousness of pose (her back, torso, have a fluidity and power more
Russian than French) and to an innate musical sensibility. Her manner is
serious - if she flirts with anything, it is with the phrasing of the dance,
and that she does divinely - and I hope the world will be hers, for she
seems destined for great things. She had as companion the young but already
established, and splendid, Nicolas Le Riche, hero of the recent house
revival of Le Train Bleu. The pas de deux was radiant.
Ghislaine Fallou is another exceptional talent. She, too, revealed a dignity
of presence, a lovely clarity of pose and grace of phrasing. She needed all
these to redeem Ben Stevenson's Three Preludes in which she was trapped with
her partner, the elegant Yann Bridart. The dance amounts to hollow emotings
to Rakhmaninov - it is a faked choreographic orgasm - but these devoted
artists gave the movement a sincerity which redounds enormously to their
credit. Another rescue operation was performed by Delphine Baey and Emmanuel
Hoff in the duet from William Forsythe's In the middle. Mlle Baey produced
the dead-pan force, the far-flung limbs and the general air of aggressive
boredom that the piece demands. I would love to see her in a ballet: she is
a physically dramatic dancer, excellently matched by M. Hoff.
There were other young performers on view, their moments of glory well
merited. How good to see a great national troupe able and willing to salute
its next generation. It is worth urging any visitor to Paris to the Matisse
show at the Beaubourg, where you can see the Petersburg version of La Danse,
as thrilling as the activities of the apprentice angels at the Palais
Garnier.
The Paris Opera Ballet will be on tour at the Kennedy Center, Washington,
March 18-28. Sponsored by AROP, the Florence Gould Foundation, American
Friends of the Paris Opera, and Air France

and Emmanuel Thibault (just 18) was heart-touching. Mlle Ciavara is slight,
enchantingly pretty, and delights in the intricacies of quick, clear, tiny
steps: the old Russian ballerinas used to call such choreography 'weaving
lace with your feet'. Mlle Ciavara turns, hold a floating pose, is sweetly
true in this reconstruction of a mid-19th century spectacle. M Thibault is
of medium height - Baryshnikov, Julio Bocca, his models - and already
possessor of a beautifully rounded technique. Marvels are easily done, but
more enthralling is his ability to devour space, to race and soar, and seem
a meteor. Like Mlle Ciaravola, his manner is still innocent; I long to see
them both in Coppelia.
A grand contrast came with Aurelie Dupont in Balanchine's Tchaikovsky pas de
deux. Winner of the junior gold medal in last year's Varna Ballet
Competition, she has an all-conquering skill, but it is allied to a
lusciousness of pose (her back, torso, have a fluidity and power more
Russian than French) and to an innate musical sensibility. Her manner is
serious - if she flirts with anything, it is with the phrasing of the dance,
and that she does divinely - and I hope the world will be hers, for she
seems destined for great things. She had as companion the young but already
established, and splendid, Nicolas Le Riche ,hero of the recent house
revival of Le Train Bleu. The pas de deux was radiant.
Ghislaine Fallou is another exceptional talent. She, too, revealed a dignity
of presence, a lovely clarity of pose and grace of phrasing. She needed all
these to redeem Ben Stevenson's Three Preludes in which she was trapped with
her partner, the elegant Yann Bridart. The dance amounts to hollow emotings
to Rakhmaninov - it is a faked choreographic orgasm - but these devoted
artists gave the movement a sincerity which redounds enormously to their
credit. Another rescue operation was performed by Delphine Baey and Emmanuel
Hoff in the duet from William Forsythe's In the middle. Mlle Baey produced
the dead-pan force, the far-flung limbs and the general air of aggressive
boredom that the piece demands. I would love to see her in a ballet: she is
a physically dramatic dancer, excellently matched by M. Hoff.
There were other young performers on view, their moments of glory well
merited. How good to see a great national troupe able and willing to salute
its next generation. And in matter of dance, it is worth urging any visitor
to Paris to the Matisse show at the Beaubourg, where you can see the
Petersburg version of La Danse, its movement as thrilling as the activities
of the apprentice angels at the Palais Garnier.
The Paris Opera Ballet will be on tour at the Kennedy Center, Washington,
from March 18-28. Sponsorship by AROP, the Florence Gould Foundation,
American Friends of the Paris Opera, and Air France

FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: The Kirov shows off its Bayadere - This production
demands to be seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HISTORY of La Bayadere in the West is odd. It is one of Petipa's most
fascinating works, typical of his mature creativity - it dates from 1877 -
in its combination of exotic theme and spectacular effects, and testimony to
the vivid dramatic excuses he sought for his dance sequences. It has
survived in Petersburg despite revolution and ideological nit-picking. In
the West, while some of the old Mariinsky ballets percolated into the
repertory, no company could find the forces to mount such an undertaking.
It was during the first Kirov season in London in 1961, when the Shades
scene was part of a gala evening, that the importance of this choreographic
marvel was made clear. Nureyev's subsequent Shades staging for the Royal
Ballet was proof that the West might honourably emulate Russia. A BBCTV
transmission of the Kirov production in 1973 was significant; a decade later
Makarova revived the full-length ballet for American Ballet Theatre (and
very astutely reconstructed the last act that Leningrad had dropped 'for
lack of proper forces' after the Revolution.) This staging she was later to
mount for the Royal Ballet, and in Milan, Stockholm and Rio. Rudolf
Nureyev's last gift to the Paris Opera was a Bayadere which reproduced the
Kirov version. La Bayadere had become part of Western ballet's traditions.
But the Kirov could not tour it. One of the joys of seeing ballet in
Petersburg was the magnificence of the Bayadere scenery - dating from the
turn of the century, and too fragile to travel - as frame for Kirov classic
manner and mimetic dignity. Now the company has had the old scenery copied -
impeccably - and can show the West this ancestral treasure. It looked fine
on a first London outing on Thursday night. The Coliseum stage is somewhat
small for its grandiose scale, and the lighting was less than subtle, but
the painted sets are magnificent, and, making greatest sense of Petipa's
artifices, there are the Kirov artists.
The version is slightly edited - where was the Danse Manu, and some
variations in the Grand Pas? - but it is the authentic Bayadere, and demands
to be seen. La Bayadere is a ballet most serious in its dramatic
underpinning - sacred love in conflict with profane passion - and vastly
challenging for soloists and principals. The confrontation between Nikiya
and Gamzatti which ends the first act is as emotionally challenging as
anything in the old repertory. The division of dance interest - the
passionate Gamzatti given the bravura Grand Pas; the 'holy' Nikiya rewarded
with the Shades scene - reveals Petipa's astute sense of theatre. Solor is a
numbskull, but a tormented one, and the part rewards bold playing - as
Mukhamedov, Bocca and Manuel Legris have variously shown us. The technical
demands of the Grand Pas and the Shades sequence are among the greatest in
19th century ballet, and Petipa's dramatic skill can be seen in the
hallucinatory entry of the Shades as in the spacious exposition of
narrative. Minkus' score - given in the wise version preserved at the
Mariinsky - is no mean support for the drama, as the eloquent orchestral
playing proved.
But Bayadere demands potent central interpretations. Olga Chenchikova was
the Gamzatti of the this first performance, and opulently right. Her dancing
is magnificent in scale and assurance, commanding space in step and outline,
womanly rather than girlish - and how welcome for this fact. She provides a
physical force, a psychic intensity, that make the character fascinating in
temperament as in dance. Konstantin Zaklinsky was a Solor credible at every
moment, competent in his few dance passages, but notable for the stylistic
intelligence with which he illuminated conventional dramatics. We believed
in him.
I could not, though, believe in Yulia Makhalina as Nikiya. She is a
beautiful young woman, her silhouette long, sophisticated, her technique
forcefully brilliant. Alas, she plays Nikiya on the terms of her own
self-absorbtion. The role does not exist save as a display-piece for
extravagant prowess. The temple-dancer looks like a visiting star; the Shade
is concerned only with technical dazzle. Those spiritual qualities with
which Makarova and Asylmuratova have imbued the role - the dance as
declaration of holiest feeling, and gaining in luminosity thereby - are
foreign to Makhalina's reading. It is lit by technical fireworks rather than
the sacred fire of the first scene.
The three Shades soloists displayed Kirov classicism at its most satisfying.
I have already praised Larissa Lezhnina and Irina Sitnikova this season.
Their companion, Irina Shapchits, is no less admirable. In the third
variation she produced ravishing dancing: exquisite in control, pure in form
as in manner. I have never seen the solo better done.
The Kirov season continues at the Coliseum until July 31

<F P=106> [Giorgio Bocca article: "Anticommunism Without Communists"] </F>
  [Text] Two temptations attributable to the fear of the new 
have become widespread in this confused election campaign -- 
anticommunism and Berlusconism. 
  Anticommunism without communism creates figments of the 
imagination which are completely without foundation but for that 
very reason irresistible. The RAI [state radio and television 
service] is dominated by the communists! How? Where? It is 
better not to ask, because it will make you look like either a 
communist or a gullible idiot. 
  No matter that the RAI's director is Gianni Locatelli, a 
Catholic, surrounded by professorial figures reminiscent of 
Bocconi or originating from Giuseppe de Rita's ultra-Catholic 
CENSIS [Social Investments Studies Center]. 
  No matter that two out of three television networks do not 
belong to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] area and that 
when it comes to radio, the Catholic, Aldo Grasso, is in charge 
of cultural programs and the liberal-socialist, Livio Zanetti, 
head of news. Never mind that: The RAI is dominated by 
communists. The proof? The RAI does not like [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi, who is leading a crusade against communism; 
"therefore" it is communist itself. "Is it not that the RAI is 
justifiably afraid that if Berlusconi is victorious he could 
gobble it up?" "Don't talk nonsense. It is communist." 
  The judiciary too are communists. This was said yesterday, 
to deafening applause, by red Titti [Judge Tiziana Parenti] -- 
apart from her hair, a few years ago she was also red by 
political affiliation. None of the magistrates involved in the 
corruption investigations -- Di Pietro, Colombo, Davigo, 
D'Ambrosio -- has ever been a communist party member, but if 
Titti Parenti says so, they definitely are communists. "But are 
they not trying almost obsessively to make Sama confess that 
Gardini paid the communists a billion lire?" "Yes, but it is 
all a sham." 
  The universities are communists, and so are the major 
newspapers. "But are their bosses not members of the haute 
bourgeoisie, major businessmen?" "Yes, but of the kind that 
flirt with communism in order to jointly trample honest 
anticommunist businessmen." 
  Anticommunism without communism is spreading like wildfire 
because it conceals a fear of the new -- which is indeed real, a 
constant factor in Italy's tradition of quick-change acts, in a 
country where, from Garibaldi to Mussolini, all destroyers of 
the old state resigned and promptly began to rebuild it. Not 
that we have confidence in the transformation of the progressive 
alliance; what has happened in France and Spain prompts caution, 
but be that as it may, a left-wing government must surely change 
a few details, must surely try to eliminate some bad habits, 
must surely correct some inefficiencies and instances of wastage 
-- enough to terrify the moderates who, if the ruling parties 
had not died of their own account, through a process of emptying 
and paralysis, would want them back again. 
  Berlusconism is the other side of the fear of the new; it is 
the old in a superficially new guise, and the moderates seek 
nothing more than superficial change. The League and the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] could not succeed on their own. For 
90 percent of Italians, the League is something alien and 
dangerous, parochial and secessionist. It may be only a paper 
tiger, but you never know what things will lead to -- look at 
what happened in Yugoslavia. Gianfranco Fini's MSI is less 
worrying, but still disreputable. The right man is Silvio 
Berlusconi, who represents the Italian people's two great loves 
-- soccer and television, the self-made man, from pauper to 
millionaire, but always easy to get along with. Who better than 
him could painlessly carry out the great and painless changeover 
of Italian politicians? Out with the old faces of the criminals 
and corrupt, and in with the unknown faces that are by that 
token new. 
  Silvio Berlusconi is said to have told journalists who asked 
him about his program: "I will not tell you; otherwise the 
others will copy it." Such a reply would sound ridiculous in a 
country that really wants to change, but it is a stroke of 
genius in a country that has no desire to change. A great and 
painless changeover of the political class: This is what the 
moderates expect from Berlusconi. The greedy service-sector 
bourgeoisie, with their carnation [Italian Socialist Party 
symbol] buttonholes, that used to applaud Bettino Craxi have 
been replaced by a second generation who applaud Berlusconi in 
the expectation of being able to further their careers and their 
own interests. 
  If the system of party rule was somehow similar to fascism, 
we must unfortunately admit that it collapsed without any 
anti-Fascists. At the Rome conference of Forza Italia, 
representing the same old Italy motivated by the principle of 
just getting along somehow, the audience applauded loudly -- and 
I would say with relief -- the vague hymns to economic 
liberalism, deregulation, and to God, country, family, and 
individuals that leave things as they are. 
  Both the moderates' anticommunism without communism and the 
vilification of Berlusconi, described as the "Black Knight" and 
founder of a Fascism clad in a cashmere sweater are both 
imaginary. What the moderates expect from Berlusconi in the 
event of victory is that he will recycle the democracy of the 
First Republic, complete with soccer and television.

L'ITALO-AMERICANO, THE VOICE OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE SOUTHLAND SINCE 1908 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In San Francisco, New York, Chicago and elsewhere, Italian-Americans who live 
in the comfortable anonymity of the suburbs can return to their roots in the 
remnants of old Italian neighborhoods, where the language and culture have 
withstood change. 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles has the fourth-largest Italian-American population in the 
country, it has no such urban enclave serving as a symbolic cultural hub. But 
Los Angeles does have L'Italo-Americano, a bilingual weekly newspaper published 
in the San Fernando Valley and distributed statewide. It is the voice of the 
Italian language and immigrant experience in California. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighborhoods are gone, but something else has replaced them," said 
Kenneth Scambray, a literature professor and writer at the University of La 
Verne, and L'Italo-Americano's book critic. "The newspaper is an extremely 
valuable instrument for maintaining communication between groups as they spread 
out." 
</P>
<P>
L'Italo-Americano (The Italian-American) was founded in 1908 and has been 
published since 1971 at Villa Scalabrini, a Valley retirement home run by an 
order of priests serving Italian immigrants worldwide, the Scalabrini Fathers. 
The newspaper has grown from a two-page local paper published exclusively in 
Italian and dominated by Cleto Baroni, a Florentine immigrant and editor for 
almost 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 15 years, the paper has added a section covering the San Francisco 
Bay Area and an English-language section. Because of its dispersed and diverse 
audience, L'Italo-Americano plays several roles simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a segment of our readers for whom our newspaper is the main, if not 
the only, avenue of information," said Father Mario Trecco, editor since 1971. 
"We are here to please a variety of different tastes. Some people may come to 
it because of the recipes and find cultural news. Some may look at the cultural 
and discover social events. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
About 1.1 million people of Italian descent live in California, according to 
government studies, nearly half of them in Southern California. But there are 
only a few outposts in the Los Angeles area where Italian-Americans can make 
pilgrimages to their roots. 
</P>
<P>
The Casa Italiana cultural center and adjoining St. Peter's Church in Chinatown 
are solitary vestiges of a former Little Italy nearby, on North Broadway. There 
are scattered social clubs, stores and restaurants in San Pedro, Alhambra, 
Arcadia, Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California and elsewhere, language and urban geography are no 
longer the pillars of ethnic identity. The fluid nature of society in 
California speeded the process by which immigrants became assimilated, 
dispersed and "upraised," the term used by historian Andrew Rolle in his book 
about Italian immigration in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are looking at is simply the fact that Italian-Americans have gone on 
to another level of the pluralism in American society," Scambray said. 
</P>
<P>
Trecco and assistant editor Luigi Smaldino produce the newspaper for an 
estimated 35,000 readers from basement offices in Villa Scalabrini. Up-to-the 
minute news and soccer results come from the Italian news wire, ANSA. 
Correspondents contribute from overseas and around the state. 
</P>
<P>
L'Italo-Americano is "two papers in one," Trecco said. The Italian-language 
section presents news from Italy and the world on the front pages, followed by 
U.S. and California news focused on Italian people and events. 
</P>
<P>
Columnists include Hollywood chronicler Argentina Brunetti and "Donna 
Carlotta," a mysterious gossip columnist whose targets have included Zsa Zsa 
Gabor and comedian Billy Crystal, the latter for a joke he made alluding to 
organized crime while hosting the Oscar ceremonies. The statement was condemned 
by Italian-American groups. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Carlotta's identity remains top secret despite insistent inquiries by 
readers such as Carlo Rambaldi, the Oscar-winning special effects craftsman, 
Smaldino said. 
</P>
<P>
The front section attracts immigrants who prefer to read and speak Italian, 
even if they have been here for decades. Jenny De Santis, 88, is among older 
women who follow weekly excerpts from a historical novel about Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy reading Italian," she said in Italian during a telephone interview. 
She said she has lived in this country 66 years. "I've learned to speak 
American, but to write," she said, switching to English, "for-getabout." 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers target readers for groceries, legal and medical services, 
mortuaries, travel agencies. Trecco said the response shows that an enduring 
consumer population prefers to do business in Italian. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes advertising becomes for a lot of Italians a recommendation," Trecco 
said. "If they are served badly they hold us responsible. We have to be 
careful." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in the years after the paper's acquisition and switch to nonprofit 
status, which prohibits political involvement, readers called in asking for the 
political endorsements they had followed during Baroni's time. 
</P>
<P>
Other readers say they want to learn or keep in touch with the language. 
Students in Italian classes, such as those of UCLA professor Althea 
Caravacci-Reynolds, subscribe at a discount. "It is a good vehicle for 
promoting the study of Italian," Caravacci-Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Fabiani, Mayor Tom Bradley's chief of staff, counts himself among 
subscribers who struggle through the paper in hopes of improving the Italian 
they never quite learned. 
</P>
<P>
"I can read a little bit," said Fabiani, 32. He is the grandson of southern 
Italian immigrants and grew up in Pennsylvania. "I do my best every week." 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani then turns to the English-language section, which makes up one-third of 
the paper and is geared to younger readers and others looking for information 
about community and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Trecco writes an overview in English of Italian politics and prints excerpts of 
books on travel and history. Topics range from the government crisis generated 
by the kidnap-murder of Prime Minister Aldo Moro in the 1970s, to a local 
Sicilian cultural festival, to a film project about the architect of the Watts 
Towers, Simon Rodia. 
</P>
<P>
Readership increased with the addition of English, Trecco said, although the 
language division is the subject of contention. 
</P>
<P>
One disgruntled former subscriber is Tom Ruatta. He gathers with other senior 
citizens of northern Italian origins for bocce matches in the festive, spacious 
clubhouse of the Garibaldina M.B. Society in Highland Park, where Italian and 
English echo in unison. 
</P>
<P>
Ruatta canceled his subscription because of the predominance of Italian pages. 
He thinks the newspaper should bow to the inevitable, switch to English and 
appeal to the bulk of the ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason I quit," he said. "How many of us read Italian? I don't have 
time to sit there and try to read it." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Secondo Actis demurred. The retired businessman and his wife divide 
their time between their native Turin and "Il Vallone," as he calls the San 
Fernando Valley. Actis said the paper will not be Italian if it loses the 
language. 
</P>
<P>
But he predicted that the language and groups like the Garibaldina, a mutual 
benefit society-turned social club with 900 members, are doomed because young 
people are not interested. 
</P>
<P>
"We are too spread out," he said in Italian. "In 20, 25 years, when the people 
in this place have died, these things will disappear." 
</P>
<P>
This debate about the future of the Italian-American press and community has 
taken place around the country. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, for example, a city with a more numerous and visible 
Italian-American community than Los Angeles, the Fra Noi monthly is thick and 
thriving. But it has traditionally devoted only a few pages to Italian and many 
pages in English to columns by local politicians. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposite extreme, readers around New York still support an 
Italian-language daily, America Oggi. 
</P>
<P>
Caravacci-Reynolds and Scambray said the Los Angeles paper will endure in its 
current form because the study of Italian is increasing, spurred by the efforts 
of Italian-American organizations and interest on the part of Italians and 
non-Italians. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the underlying connection has to be made through the language," 
Scambray said. "We must continue to put pressure on people to read the 
language." 
</P>
<P>
Trecco said he sees his mission as fomenting love of the language, but not 
necessarily as protecting its survival. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's destined to disappear as a living language used for everyday 
communication in this country," he said. "However I see an increasing need in 
the second and third generation of pursuing the study of the language for 
cultural reasons."

   The gala celebrating the 50th anniversary of
American Ballet Theater was such a success here in January that the
company decided to open its two-month season at the Metropolitan
Opera House by repeating it.
   There were a few differences Monday night; the evening was less
exciting but smoother running. As one ballet excerpt ended, the
next dancers entered. The audience could applaud but there was no
wasted time.
   This time, Alicia Alonso did not dance and Igor Youskevitch did
not make a speech. Two who danced Monday and did not in January
were Carla Fracci and Faruk Ruzimatov, formerly a Kirov Ballet
star, who has joined Ballet Theater.
   Mikhail Baryshnikov and Jerome Robbins, both praised during the
evening, did not attend either gala. Agnes de Mille gave a stirring
speech each time, though on Monday her body mike went on and off.
Company co-director Oliver Smith said 750 company members have
danced 385 ballets by 168 choreographers in the 50 years.
   Miss de Mille said, ``Lucia (Chase) said she wanted it to
include every kind of good ballet dancing and it did. People said
we had no style. That was our style.''
   She spoke after a lively excerpt from her ``Rodeo,'' with
Kathleen Moore as the Cowgirl and Victor Barbee as the Wrangler.
   Carla Fracci, an Italian ballerina much loved when she was a
guest artist with American Ballet Theater, danced the bride-to-be
in Antony Tudor's ``Lilac Garden.'' It was a poignant excerpt, with
Ricardo Bustamante as Her Lover, Michael Owen as The Man She Must
Marry and Martine Van Hamel as An Episode in His Past. Two other
Tudor excerpts were ``Pillar of Fire'' and ``The Leaves Are
Fading.''
   Ruzimatov provided excitement, danced a bravura solo from ``Le
Corsaire.'' Fernando Bujones also did bravura dancing, with Cheryl
Yeager in a ``Don Quixote'' excerpt and with Christine Dunham in a
Black Swan excerpt. Bjuones, an audience favorite when he was a
member of the company, has returned and was listed in the program
as a guest.
   Christine Dunham and Ross Stretton danced a White Swan duet.
Stretton will give his final performance May 22 and become
assistant to the company's directors. Johan Renvall also had a
flashy solo, the dance of the Bronze Idol from ``La Bayadere.''
Alessandra Ferri and Ricardo Bustamante did part of the hushed but
passionate balcony scene from Kenneth MacMillan's ``Romeo and
Juliet.''
   Dancer Kevin McKenzie made a speech saluting American Ballet
Theater's dancers through the years. At the end, a dozen company
alumni took bows with all the evening's dancers.

   Prospective jurors for the trial of reputed
organized crime members accused in a plot against a reputed Mafia
leader were asked how they view the Mafia and Italian-Americans as
jury selection began Monday.
   A pool of 90 potential jurors was called to U.S. District Court
for the case against six reputed members of the Genovese crime
family.
   The six are charged in a racketeering conspiracy that includes
controlling labor unions, extortion in the construction industry,
loansharking, illegal gambling, several murders and a conspiracy to
kill John Gotti, the reputed boss of the rival Gambino family, and
his brother, Gene.
   The trial is expected to provide a broad, detailed look at the
workings of a major organized crime family.
   The Gottis' names were listed among 100 people and businesses on
a questionnaire passed out to jury prospects, who were asked if they
were familiar with the names.
   Jury selection is expected to continue for the remainder of the
week.
   On trial are reputed Genovese ``consigliere,'' or No. 3 leader,
Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna, 59, of Jersey City; his alleged deputy,
restaurateur Martin ``Motts'' Casella, 71, of Secaucus; Richard
``Bocci'' DeSciscio, 42, of Bayonne, termed an enforcer for the
group; Rocco J. Napoli, 42, of Secaucus; John Derrico, 27, of
Hoboken; and Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello, 67, of Hoboken.
   All have pleaded innocent and deny involvement in organized crime.
   Judge Maryanne Trump Barry ordered that the jury remain anonymous
because of the nature of the charges.

Italian crafts, food and entertainment -- including fireworks,
bocce exhibitions, Epcot's Italian Street Players, Italian flag
throwers and local tarantella dancers -- will be part of the l990

than 100 craftspeople will set up shop under colorful tents for a
South Florida interpretation of an Italian street plaza. For more
information, call (407) 844-8070. _
   Cherry Blossom Festival, San Francisco, April 20-22 and April
27-29. The bay city shows off its Japanese influence at the 23rd
annual Cherry Blossom Festival. Kimono-clad performers, taiko drums
and chicken teriyaki highlight the festival, which is known as
sakura matsuri in Japan. _

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IF there's ever to be "The Godfather, the Finale," composer Henry Brant seems
already to have set its atmosphere to music in magnificently doleful colors
for the San Jose Symphony.;    The nostalgia about the fading Italian
tradition in our world overflowed the Center for the Performing Arts on Friday
night with the world premiere of Brant's "The Old Italians Dying" for
orchestra and poem-narrator.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  GHOSTS OF ITALY CONJURED UP FOR POETIC HAUNTING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     San Francisco Beat Generation poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, 72, recited his
own poem, looking like one of the text's old Italians in felt hat on a park
bench -- a doomed species, awaiting extinction between games of bocce ball,
repeats of "Santa Lucia" and intermittent funeral bells marking the parting of
ways.;    The bells and balls, the tolling and the telling, the Chianti and
manicotti -- the poem to music conjured up the palpable atmosphere despite the
edginess of the gravel-voiced, crusty Ferlinghetti, making his symphonic
debut.;    Brant's music is multilevel, with the onstage strings providing the
wall-to-wall carpet of sound. Over this are laid a dozen or more quotations
from Verdi's "Aida," Rossini's "The Barber of Seville," Ponchielli's "The
Dance of the Hours," the folk song "Funiculi, Funicula," even a fascist hymn
from Mussolini's day.;    Brant astutely heaps these into interludes between
stanzas, assuring intelligibility of the text and of its many refrains and
images. Rather than prettify the music, he retrieves it as if heard from vague
sources -- from memory, from a scratchy record player, or maybe from a
staticky radio.;    After the 18-minute span, the effect was riveting,
buffeting in distortions, yet beautiful in the work's restraint.;    The six
mini-ensembles scattered about the balcony provide a counterpoint to the
orchestra as well as a competition, marching to its own independent conductor
(Brant).;    The impact of surround-sound never ceases to amaze in Brant's
music: His sonics embrace the listener, and on this night enkindled one of the
season's longest ovations.;    Unfortunately, compositions that quote to
excess breed instant recognition but rarely show much staying power after the
first performance or two. Nonetheless Brant's manner of bringing
expressiveness out of chaotic mismatches is undeniably imposing.;    No less
welcome was the immensely difficult Debussy "La Mer," where conductor George
Cleve enjoys a special advantage over other American conductors who merely
flounder about Debussy's ocean: Cleve is a link once removed from Debussy
himself. The link was his teacher, Pierre Monteux, whose career in Paris
overlapped Debussy's creative span.;    As a result, this was a superior "La
Mer" -- not without wrong notes, true, but thoroughly mysterious in its
unfathomable subtleties, and its nearly unidentifiable orchestral sounds.;   
The concert concluded with Dvorak's Symphony No. 7, a work as sparkling as the
mountain streams of Dvorak's native Bohemia. Dvorak vacillates between major
and minor keys with a facility second to none; he can also bring on rhythmic
shifts (as in his finale) associated with far bolder innovators.;    This is
Brant's third time around in San Jose with Cleve. The transplanted New Yorker
who moved to Santa Barbara in 1980 performed and was recorded with the
symphony (on the Sonic Arts label) in "Litany of Tides," with violinist Daniel
Kobialka.;    In addition, Brant's early opus "On the Nature of Things" was
played here five years ago.;    Besides having written 120 works in his long
career, Brant prides himself on writing for different instrumental
combinations in each new work, and on positioning his players at many
different places around the concert hall.;  San Jose Symphony; George Cleve,
conductor; Lawrence Ferlinghetti, narrator, Paul Torelier, cello; When, where:
8:30 tonight, Center for the Performing Arts, 255 Almaden Blvd., San Jose;
2:30 p.m. Sunday, Flint Center, De Anza College, 21250 Stevens Creek Blvd.,
Cupertino.; Tickets: CPA: $10-$35. Flint Center: $9-$21. (408) 998-2277, (415)

BUSTAMANTE AND FERRI IN EVENING PERFORMANCE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Her extension seems to grow higher every year, but Alessandra Ferri is still a 
great Juliet where it counts -- in her intense surrender to each moment of 
Kenneth MacMillan's Shakespeare ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday evening in Shrine Auditorium, Ferri graced the last performance of the 
American Ballet Theatre season. Her Romeo: Ricardo Bustamante, a Ballet Theatre 
soloist with an unusually high extension of his own and an ability to almost 
match her sense of spontaneity and passionate involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Though his best dancing had extraordinary suavity and technical plush, 
Bustamante did not always look comfortable in his solos, with their emphasis on 
intricate combinations of jumps and turns in place. However, the duets were 
glorious: paradigms of mutual risk, trust and inspiration. Bustamante's 
sensitivity as an actor and strength as a partner released Ferri into dancing 
of thrilling urgency, intimacy, generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, this final "Romeo and Juliet" featured a number of pointed character 
portrayals: Victor Barbee's brutal Tybalt, for example, and Clark Tippet's 
haughty Capulet, plus, as always, Georgina Parkinson's memorably elegant and 
neurotic Lady Capulet. 
</P>
<P>
John Summers made a confused, manipulated Paris (another victimized Verona 
youth rather than a co-conspirator). As Mercutio, Danilo Radojevic followed 
current Ballet Theatre practice by reducing the character to generalized 
sweetness and solid-gold virtuosity. Jack Everly conducted.LEWIS SEGAL

<DESCRIPT>  NEIGHBORHOOD; PARK; DRUG; ABUSE; CRIME; PROTEST; SAN-JOSE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  An aroused downtown San Jose neighborhood, fearful of crime near its park,
held a candlelight vigil Wednesday night and demanded more city spending and
police patrols to snuff increasing problems with gangs and drugs.;   The
protest foretold dilemmas the city council will face early next year when it
tackles a $20.6 million budget shortfall in a second straight year of terrible
fiscal news. Though city services may be cut, parks and police remain potent
political touchstones throughout San Jose.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  S.J. NEIGHBORS MARCH TO PROTEST GANGS, DRUGS IN
PARK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Joined by Councilman David Pandori, more than 100 people bundled up in the
night air to walk a solemn square around Backesto Park. They started at North
13th and Jackson streets, holding tapered candles and walking to the martial
beat of a tenor drum.;   "I played here as a child; my daughter played here as
a child; and now the kids can't even play," said one marcher, Marlene Perez,
40, who lives on North 16th Street.;   The 10 1/2-acre park, one of 143 in San
Jose, is the focal point of a working-class neighborhood on San Jose's North
Side, traditionally ethnic Italian but recently turning Hispanic and Southeast
Asian.;   It is known for its lighted softball diamond, its singular orange
tent covering bocce ball courts, and the folksy neighborhood eateries at two
of its corners, Rollo's Donut &amp; Coffee Shop and Emma's Taqueria.;   People in
the neighborhood suspect that crime has grown in and around Backesto since
Roosevelt Park, a few blocks southeast, became a targeted Project Crackdown
area in March.;   Project Crackdown is a city program to clean up
neighborhoods and stop illegal drug sales.;   At an evening meeting in Holy
Cross Church, organized by People Acting in Community Together, people talked
about thugs gathering in the park at night, wearing what appear to be gang
colors. Merchants were said to be harassed by vandals. "Drug houses" were said
to proliferate in the area.  </TEXT>

<F P=106> [Commentary by Giorgio Bocca: "Berlusconi Thanks His </F>
Enemies...."] 
  [Text] In all competitions the winner wins partly thanks to 
his own merits and partly also thanks to his adversary's 
weaknesses. And these weaknesses are partly the result of 
ignorance and presumption and partly the result of a history 
that has taken place and that it has been impossible to 
eliminate overnight. This is what has happened in the two 
recent elections, one confirming the other. What were the 
weaknesses and mistakes of the Left, for which Achille Occhetto 
is now paying? The first, I would say, was the inability of 
first the PCI [Italian Communist Party], then the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] to co-opt the moderates. It is 
not true that the Italian Left is numerically weaker than the 
Left in other European countries: It commands 30 percent, like 
the socialist parties in France, Britain, Spain, and Germany -- 
except that they find allies, whereas it does not. 
  The fault for this inability to co-opt does not of course 
lie 
solely with Occhetto and the rest of the leadership, which 
succeeded in making the abjuration that the Communist Parties of 
France, Spain, and Portugal never made. But this time it failed 
to overcome the imprinting of Third International-style 
communism, of the single and different party which could lead to 
the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
  This was seen extremely clearly at the 25 April and 1 May 
rallies. The party leadership wanted two great demonstrations 
of unified progressives; it wanted to bind the values of the 
resistance and labor to the democratic front that opposed the 
new Right, but the comrades in Reggio Emilia or Grosseto did not 
see it exactly that way: They came to Milan and Turin with 
their banners and flags to show Italy that the old Communist 
Party was still the strongest and different. And the moment 
Bossi and the League supporters joined the rallies they booed 
them loudly. 
  Their second mistake, or sad destiny, was to have taken 
insufficient account of the country's modernization -- and I am 
not talking about an ideal kind of modernization, but simply 
keeping pace with the times. There was a failure to realize 
that the crisis of the system of party domination was indeed the 
crisis of corrupt parties, but also of the party as such and of 
all large organizations of delegated responsibility; that 
monothematic class definitions had come to an end and that 
archipelagoes of different interests had emerged in their place. 
In other words, that although the workers existed, they were no 
longer visible as a class; that the trade unions existed, but no 
longer represented all the workers. 
  I think that this was easy to understand and that the PDS 
leaders did so; the difficult thing was to draw the necessary 
conclusions, to abandon the customary routine, the fiction that 
the old automatic relations between party, trade unions, and 
class still operated. 
  The third mistake was the hysteria common to the entire 
progressive front. The rejection of the election result, the 
belief that insults, scandal-mongering, and total negation were 
enough, if not to reverse the situation, then at least to freeze 
it. That was a mistake, and the European elections have 
confirmed the fact. 
  But Forza Italia won partly also thanks to the errors and 
weaknesses of the League and of its leader, Umberto Bossi. We 
knew he was not very British in his approach, but his inability 
to accept defeat displays very bad manners. He has been 
described as "that crazy uncle from Brianza" with reference to 
the rather eccentric, cantankerous, but nevertheless rather 
likable kind of uncle that you find living in the provinces. 
But what Bossi has been displaying for some time is not so much 
fierce polemics or eccentricity, as mental confusion. Somebody 
should explain to him -- though I fear it would be in vain -- 
that his contortions and inconsistencies achieve the result of 
earning Forza Italia more votes, as we have seen in the European 
elections. 
  Bossi thinks he is smart -- super-smart, in fact, someone 
who 
can deceive everyone by saying something and then retracting it. 
And he thought that the general elections, with the horse 
trading over the first-past-the-post system, were the ultimate 
proof of his cunning. He reasoned exactly like [former Italian 
Socialist Party Secretary] Bettino Craxi who, with his 11 
percent of the votes, wanted 30 percent of the seats. The 
Italian people would not agree to it, and if he thinks he can 
reverse the situation by shouting that Berlusconi is a 
mercenary, that he will deprive him of all his television 
channels, that the League is the only anti-dictatorial 
democratic force, which, however, instead of abandoning the 
dictatorship that is being formed, remains within it in order to 
resist it -- he is making a big mistake. 
  It is all nonsense, and nothing more so than the observation 
that "the Italian people failed to understand." But the Italian 
people, by penalizing him and the League's inconsistencies, 
simply followed their desire for stability, and if the new 
government's critical mass is Forza Italia, if the force which 
attracts votes by virtue of its sheer weight is Forza Italia, 
this is the very reason why they voted for it. The fact that 
this center-right option displeased the progressive forces and 
that some of them considered it repugnant, no less, is another 
matter, but you cannot expect those who granted the center-right 
a mandate for change in the general elections to perform a 
turnabout themselves within the space of a few weeks. 
  We hope that our fellow citizens will accept Achille 
Occhetto's resignation -- painful, we imagine -- in a civilized 
manner and that they do not attribute the Left's defeat to his 
moustache or other personal attributes. He showed great courage 
in carrying out the change of course, and now it is no tragedy 
to hand over the reins. With all the shady characters and 
scoundrels that have appeared on the political scene, it really 
would not be appropriate to crucify him....

LONG BEACH'S PASTA AL DENTE PUTS A LITTLE PIZAZZ INTO PIZZAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a little trattoria in Naples -- the Naples in Long Beach, that is -- 
called Pasta al Dente that makes remarkably quaint desserts. As you enter the 
door, you might find a chocolate-kiwi pizza staring you in the face, like a 
motif of what's to come. 
</P>
<P>
Pasta al Dente looks sort of like a Westside place: two big white rooms with 
lots of mirrors and a turquoise accent here and there, and the sound track runs 
to Mozart, Smetana and Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Kimberlie Carroll has actually worked on the Westside, e.g. at La Toque, 
and what she has done to the menu at this neighborhood pizza/pasta joint can be 
quite interesting. For instance, although not all the pizzas are remarkable, 
the Al Dente Pizza definitely is. Perched on a medium-thin crust, its topping 
of feta cheese, black olives and both dried and fresh tomatoes has a light 
texture and an enjoyably sharp flavor. 
</P>
<P>
There are some unusual pastas among the largely familiar lineup. A couple have 
curried sauces, and angel hair bocca caldo, the name supposedly meaning "hot 
mouth," is mixed with garlic, pickled medium-hot Italian peppers, sun-dried 
tomatoes and slightly peppery oil, not a huge portion but about right for a 
cold evening. Pasta Dijon is green fettuccine with chicken and a pleasantly 
novel Dijon mustard sauce. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, while the lasagna is quite sensible, filled with ricotta and 
served in a slightly peppery tomato sauce, the lasagne di mare merely adds 
shrimp, crab and scallops. Somehow it seems better plain. And Pasta al Dente's 
risotto is really a paella, the rice cooked dry with tomato sauce as in Spanish 
rice and mixed with shrimp, chicken and peas. 
</P>
<P>
There is a short list of non-pizza, non-pasta entrees, mostly involving 
chicken. The one the menu urges you to try is pollo voila, which is even more 
cross-cultural in effect than the Franco-Italian name suggests. The cream sauce 
has a Southeast Asian effect, tasting faintly of coconut as well as tarragon. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the appetizers is scallops sauteed in garlicky cream sauce. The 
only soup of the day I've tried was sweet potato, and it was extremely odd: a 
thin, slightly sweet, very fine-grained puree of sweet potato, pale ocher in 
color and scented with cinnamon and clove. It could be a sauce for a dessert, 
but it's very strange way to begin a meal. The only thorough failure I've had 
here, though, was some damp and doughy focaccia bread. 
</P>
<P>
Now to the remarkably quaint desserts. The filling of the lemon cheesecake is 
dyed a virulent yellow and has a sweet frosting, just like a layer cake. The 
thick and not excessively sweet raspberry puree it floats on, though, is 
tasteful by any standard, unusually full of raspberry flavor. There are 
decorative squiggles drawn on the sauce in creme anglaise, Westside fashion. 
</P>
<P>
This does not prepare you for what goes on with some of the other desserts. A 
luscious cheesecake full of chocolate bits comes with sauce and squiggles, but 
not tasteful raspberry sauce with gracefully wavy lines of creme anglaise; no, 
it's a checkerboard pattern of chocolate sauce and cherry-flavored creme 
anglaise with mysterious puffs of green stuff -- mint, I think -- here and 
there, like a chocoholic's drawing of a Christmas tree. The same sort of 
colorful gridwork shows up on a pair of heart-shaped chocolate brownies known 
as Chocolate Decadence. 
</P>
<P>
But as for the chocolate pizza, I really can't say. It just sits at the door, 
all alone, remote from any serving spatula. Maybe it is just a motif. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasta al Dente, 5856 Naples Plaza, Long Beach; (213) 433-1616. Open for dinner 
daily, brunch Sunday. Beer and wine. Street parking. MasterCard and Visa 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $30-$54.

<P>
As result of injury and substitution, the pair of star-cross'd lovers 
originally announced for the American Ballet Theatre performance of "Romeo and 
Juliet" on Thursday danced one day early at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Marianna Tcherkassky made a lyric, sweet Juliet who revealed unexpected 
dramatic depths and strengths in the later scenes. John Gardner, in his first 
casting as Romeo, drew only the outline of a dramatic character but proved a 
secure and considerate partner. 
</P>
<P>
While never a dancer who relied upon technique to dazzle, Tcherkassky 
compensated with purity of line and sincerity of emotion. For her, love at 
first sight meant a deeply felt pain that later turned impetuous and wild. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite that intensity, Gardner portrayed a genial, warm but self-effacing 
Romeo. He has yet to inhabit the role. He danced with careful, underpowered 
virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Boggs provided a wry, bemused Mercutio, pre-eminent among his friends in 
clear shape, vigor and non-stop momentum, and wrenching in his death scene. 
</P>
<P>
But Ross Yearsley was only a sketchy, untidy Benvolio. 
</P>
<P>
Ethan Brown made Tybalt the bully of Verona and, like a textbook bully, reacted 
with fear when he actually committed an act of violence -- in this case, 
killing Mercutio by accident. The moment relieved an otherwise oppressive 
single-note interpretation but passed all too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Dunham ventured an intriguing, atypical Rosaline, a woman who seemed 
not altogether indifferent toward Romeo. If only he hadn't caught sight of that 
other woman at the ball? 
</P>
<P>
In two cases, casting became almost prodigal: the authoritative Martine van 
Hamel as a determined and sympathetic Lady Capulet, and the virtuosic, airborne 
Johan Renvall ennobling the cameo solo duties in the Mandolin Dance. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Everly again conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Ballet Theatre continues through Sunday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $10 to $40. 
Information: (714) 556-2787.

PERFORMING ARTS CENTER TO OFFER MODERN DANCE PROGRAMS;

BE A FIRST FOR THE CENTER, WHICH IS EXPLORING THE EXTENT OF INTEREST HERE IN 
THE GENRE.

<P>
In a departure from its past emphasis on ballet, the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center will for the first time present a modern dance troupe, Center 
officials said Monday in announcing their 1990-91 dance season. 
</P>
<P>
The Martha Graham Dance Company of New York will make its only Southern 
California appearances Jan. 4-6, 1991, at the Center. The Graham company 
programs will be offered in addition to a subscription package of three ballet 
companies that includes the previously reported engagements of the Australian 
Ballet Aug. 7-12; and the New York City Ballet, Sept. 25-30, 1990, in its first 
return engagement at the Center since 1986. Rounding out the season will be the 
fifth appearance at to the Center by the American Ballet Theatre, March 12-24, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Graham dates represent an experiment for the Center, and they will be 
offered as an option for ballet subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"We will find out what interest there is for modern dance" in Orange County, 
Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said Monday. "If the Graham experience is 
good, I think there are certain other companies that we might be able to 
handle" as options for ballet subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeably absent from the list is the Joffrey Ballet, which has been part of 
the Center's ballet series three times over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said from the very beginning that we are not committed to any one 
company on an annual basis," Kendrick said. "Our goal is to provide a range of 
companies over a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said the decision not to bring the Joffrey next season was "absolutely 
not" related to the collapse of negotiations between ABT and the Los Angeles 
Music Center Operating Company in December, something that ABT Executive 
Director Jane Hermann attributed to the Joffrey's residency at the Music 
Center. (Officials at the Music Center, however, denied Hermann's charge.) 
</P>
<P>
"We have had (the Joffrey) several times and anticipate having them again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham will be represented by two programs of mixed repertory: One will include 
her classic "Appalachian Spring," set to Copland's score, and the other, her 
"Errand Into the Maze." 
</P>
<P>
For its exclusive West Coast engagement, the New York Ballet will lean heavily 
upon repertory by founding artistic director George Balanchine. "La Source," 
"Stars and Stripes," "Four Temperaments" and the infrequently toured "Vienna 
Waltzes" will be among the works danced. 
</P>
<P>
The run by American Ballet Theatre will be split between mixed repertory (to be 
announced) and either Natalia Makarova's staging of "La Bayadere" or a new 
production of "Coppelia." 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, the Australian Ballet will dance "Giselle," Lichine's 
"Graduation Ball," Lifar's "Suite en Blanc" and others to be announced by 
Australian and New Zealand choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for subscription tickets will range from $57 to $190; they will include 
four events -- one each by the Australian and New York City ballets, and two 
performances by ABT. Tickets for the Graham programs will be offered as an 
option for subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Subscription tickets will go on sale May 20. Tickets for individual programs 
will go on sale about six weeks before each engagement. Information is 
available at (714) 556-2787. 
</P>
<P>
The season: 
</P>
<P>
* Aug. 7-12: Australian Ballet: Maina Gielgud's staging of "Giselle," 
"Graduation Ball" (Johann Strauss); Lifar's "Suite en Blanc" (Lalo); other 
works to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
* Sept. 25-30: New York City Ballet: Balanchine's "Vienna Waltzes" (music by 
Lehar, Johann and Richard Strauss); "Stars and Stripes" (Sousa), "Four 
Temperaments" (Hindemith), "Tchaikovsky's Suite No. 3," "Concerto Barocco" 
(Bach); "La Source" (Delibes); "Chaconne" (Gluck); Jerome Robbins' "Dances at a 
Gathering" (Chopin); and Peter Martins' "Ecstatic Orange" (Michael Torke). 
Other works by Balanchine and Martins are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
* Jan. 4-6: Martha Graham Company: Program 1: "Embattled Garden" (Carlos 
Surinach); "Deep Song" (Henry Cowell); "Appalachian Spring" (Copland);

Joio); "Errand Into the Maze" (Menotti); "El Penitente" (Louis Horst); "Acts of 
Light" (Nielsen). 
</P>

<LEADPARA>  IT WAS a pleasant way to spend an afternoon for Lester Briggs. Tuesday boasted
a sky of early summer blue, a couple of blue jays were hovering among the
green pines. Briggs had 14,400 square feet of green grass in front of him. A
sign outside the gate: "Palo Alto Lawn Bowls Club.";    Briggs has been lawn
bowling for almost 4 1/2 years now. At first, he didn't think much of the
game. "I got introduced by a neighbor," the 74-year-old Palo Alto man said. "I
resisted for a long time."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Briggs would rather swing a few at the golf course. The thought of rolling
a bowl down a patch of grass didn't strike his fancy -- at first.;    The
object of the game is to get more of your bowls nearer to a little white ball
(called the jack) than your opponent. Sounds pretty easy, except that the
bowls are not round. They're flatter on one side, so the bias makes the bowl
curve one way, a source of much frustration.;    "It almost wrecks my golf
game," Briggs said.;    It's an intricate, mental game, said Harry Press, who
along with his wife, Martha, joined the club three years ago. "Like any game,
it has its moment of joy, its moment of horror," Press said. "If you're a
golfer, you understand that.";    The game might have come from Egypt about
7,000 years ago. But one cannot separate lawn bowling from the British. The
sport is quite popular in Australia, India, New Zealand, Hong Kong -- places
where the Union Jack once cast its shadow. George Washington was an avid lawn
bowler. He reportedly stopped though, when folks deemed it was too British for
the colonials.;    BRIGGS DOESN'T mind that it's a British game. He's one of
the better players in the Palo Alto club, which boasts 125 members ranging
from 28 to 86 years old.;    He didn't mind showing me how to play the game. I
tiptoed on the lawn, as gingerly as a teen-ager creeping home after curfew, so
I wouldn't damage the grass. Briggs said the club doesn't like to have young
kids there. "They'd want to play touch football or something," he said. I
surveyed the lawn -- it would be a killer place to practice your putting.;   
"You want to roll the bowl off of your fingers," he said. I tried. I missed
the mark by a couple of ZIP codes. I tried a few more times. Briggs is a very
patient man. He would have to be, because I was not very good. It was futility
in the afternoon.;    "This Palo Alto green, in my opinion, is the finest
green in California," Briggs had said earlier. So I couldn't blame the course.
I exited the club and Briggs went back to his friends.;    There were many
more games to play.;    The Palo Alto Lawn Bowls Club opens its door 1 to 3
p.m. Saturday. Coaches will be there to show you how it's done. Just wear
soft-soled shoes. The green is at the corner of Cowper Street and Churchill
Avenue. Call (415) 323-2575.;    For those of you interested in watching the
Italian form of lawn bowling, there are U.S. Bocce championships today through
Saturday at Fiesta Garden in San Mateo. Opening ceremonies are at 8:30 a.m.
and the games run till about 5 p.m. each day. It's free.  </TEXT>

   Federal prosecutors were preparing to tell a
bloody tale of restaurant rubouts, a ``contract'' to assassinate
reputed mob boss John Gotti and Mafia control of construction as the
trial of six alleged organized crime figures opened today.
   Jury selection began today, and opening arguments were scheduled
to start next week. U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry granted
the government's request for an anonymous jury _ a first for a
federal trial in New Jersey _ because of the nature of the case.
   The trial is expected to shed light on organized crime violence
in the New York metropolitan area, and may help solve a string of
mob-related murders dating back 12 years.
   It also will mark the courtroom debut of Vincent ``Fish'' Cafaro
as a prosecution witness.
   Cafaro is a former associate of jailed and aging former Genovese
boss Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno. He testified last year before
Congress about life in the mob and its activities.
   Ms. Barry said the case ``makes no pretense of being other than
an organized crime case in which the inner workings of the Mafia
will be hammered home.''
   The main defendants, indicted in June, are reputed Genovese
``consigliere,'' or No. 3 leader, Louis A. ``Bobby'' Manna, 59; his
deputy, restaurant owner Martin ``Motts'' Casella, 71; and Richard
``Bocci'' DeSciscio, 42, termed an enforcer for the group. The three
are being held without bail.
   They and the other defendants _ Rocco J. Napoli, 42, John
Derrico, 27, and Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello, 67, _ are charged with
racketeering.
   The racketeering charge includes allegations of controlling labor
unions, extorting construction industry figures, trafficking in
stolen goods, loan sharking, illegal gambling, murder and murder
conspiracy. All deny the charges and organized crime ties.
   Much of the government's case rests on 2,500 hours of taped
conversations recorded in a back room of a Hoboken restaurant from
June 1987 to March 1988.
   Prosecutors said they will present evidence about a plot to kill
Gotti, the flamboyant reputed boss of the Gambino crime family in
New York City. Authorities have said the Genovese family was angry
about Gambino incursions in northern New Jersey territory.

<TEXT>     Brant unveils tonight the world premiere of his "The Old Italians Dying,"
with the legendary San Francisco poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, 72, reading his
own free-verse poem.;    Brant is stationing his musicians at seven sites
around the concert hall for this reminiscence of the Italian immigrants of the
past.;    Space is the new dimension of our century, Brant points out. "But
the musicians have forgotten all about space, even though composers were
working on it since the Renaissance." Brant himself uses space boldly and
unconventionally. A piccolo may be in an organ loft, a tuba poised in a
stairway, and 80 trombones scattered around a cathedral.;    Among his 120
works, those since 1950 have musicians spread around the hall in many
configurations, which are specified in a chart bound into the score. His
scores provocatively specify, "Do not attempt to perform this with all your
forces on stage." At age 78, Brant remains one of the leading innovators of
the field, changing his instrumentation in every new work he tackles -- and
even incorporating elements such as jazz bands and Caribbean combos into
symphonic pieces.;    Anything goes -- but always according to a methodical
plan.;    "In spatial music, I have no real competitors," he observes. "I
guess it's because I add new problems: I use larger forces, produce great
complications in rehearsal, use unusual parts of the hall, and entail extra
expense. And usually, negotiations with a fire marshal are needed to approve
it.";    Brant's San Jose project began when Conductor George Cleve, a great
admirer of Ferlinghetti, met with the poet, then got the symphony to approve
commissioning the score to incorporate the readings.;    Wearing a faded felt
hat like the Italians of the North Beach poem, Ferlinghetti will make his
symphonic debut tonight at the Center for the Performing Arts.;    While Cleve
conducts the main orchestra on stage, Brant will lead the subordinate forces
located about the balcony.;    The 14-minute piece will develop metaphors from
the poem, such as the sound of Washington Square's church bells. There are
also more than a dozen quotes from familiar Italian music, including "Santa
Lucia," "La donna e mobile," excerpts from "Aida," the Anvil Chorus and the
Caruso standard, "Vesti la giubba." Each of the two orchestras has its own
meter, "at times on collision courses," Brant says.;    The development of
spatial music used to be widely credited to Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose
"Gruppen" came out in 1958. But Brant's "Antiphony I" predated that by five
years. The (unperformed) instructions for Darius Milhaud's "L'homme et son
desir" and Charles Ives' Symphony No. 4 came a whole generation earlier. And
the composers of the 17th century routinely wrote for antiphonal choirs at
Venice's San Marco Cathedral, in an early version of live stereo.;    Brant,
the foremost living exponent of Ives' spatial innovations, never met Ives,
much to his regret. But he recalls attending a 1931 New York City new-music
concert of music by himself, Ruggles and Ives in which one listener got in a
shouting match with unresponsive patrons about him.;    The listener was
apparently composer Ives himself, railing against closed minds. He allegedly
thundered: "This is strong music! Stand up and take it like a man!";    Too
bad Ives can't be there this weekend to hear Brant, Ferlinghetti and Cleve
enkindle the touching texts on the old Italians "sitting there / Waiting for
the bocci ball to stop rolling / Waiting for the bell to stop tolling &amp;
tolling / For the slow bell . . . telling the unfinished 'Paradiso' story.";  
 This premiere will be followed by Debussy's "La mer" and Dvorak's Seventh
Symphony, which was substituted after the 1990 death of scheduled cello
soloist Paul Tortelier.; San Jose Symphony; George Cleve, conductor; Where,
when: 8:30 tonight and Saturday night, Center for the Performing Arts, Almaden
Boulevard at Park Avenue, San Jose; 2:30 p.m. Sunday, Flint Center, De Anza
College, Cupertino; Tickets: $10-$35, (408) 998-2277, (415) 762-2277  </TEXT>
