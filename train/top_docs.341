<HEAD>Senate Votes Ban on Dumping of Sludge in Atlantic Ocean</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Medical Waste Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate vote to ban dumping sludge in the
Atlantic Ocean brings the nation ``closer to the day when we'll
stop using the ocean as a sewer,'' a key sponsor of the measure
says.
   The Senate, spurred by fears about sludge and medical waste that
has washed up recently on East Coast beaches, voted 97-0 on Tuesday
to bar the practice.
   A similar bill is awaiting action in the House.
   The Senate measure bans the dumping of municipal sludge off the
coasts of New York and New Jersey after 1991 and orders the closing
of a sludge dump site 106 miles off the New Jersey coast, the only
site where sludge can currently be legally dumped.
   The site is used by six sewage authorities in New Jersey and
three in New York, including the city of New York.
   ``We need a firm deadline, in the law, to ban the ocean dumping
of sewage sludge,'' said Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., one of the
co-sponsors. ``Only then will alternatives be put in place. Only
then will the dumping stop.''
   The Senate added an amendment by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
which bans the disposal of all medical waste in oceans or streams.
It also approved another amendment, by Lautenberg, providing a
five-year prison sentence for anyone caught violating that ban.
   ``Last week, virtually every Connecticut beach was shut down
because of medical waste during one of the hottest spells in the
state's history,'' Dodd told his colleagues.
   ``We're moving closer to the day when we'll stop using the ocean
as a sewer,'' said Lautenberg. ``Sludge dumping is a throwaway
approach to our waste problem and contributes to the overall ocean
pollution problem.''
   Congress first ordered an end to the ocean dumping of sludge in
1972. Five years later, Congress directed that the dumping be ended
by 1981. But the nine municipalities in New York and New Jersey
successfully sued in federal court to ignore that deadline.

   The Senate, spurred by fears about sludge and
medical waste washing onto East Coat beaches, voted 97-0 on Tuesday
passage of a bill which bans the dumping of sludge in the Atlantic
Ocean.
   The action sends the measure to the House, where a similar bill
is on the floor awaiting final action.
   The bill bans the dumping of municipal sludge off the coasts of
New York and New Jersey after 1991 and orders the closing of a
sludge dump site 106 miles off the New Jersey coast. That location
is the only site where sludge currently can be legally dumped.
   The site is used by six sewage authorities in New Jersey and

   Before approving the bill, the Senate added an amendment by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., which bans the disposal of all medical
waste in oceans or streams. It also approved another amendment, by
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., providing a five-year prison
sentence for anyone caught violating that ban.
   Both amendments were approved by voice vote without any audible
dissent.
   Dodd told his colleagues that because of medical waste washing
up on his state's beaches, ``last week, virtually every Connecticut
beach was shut down because of medical waste during one of the
hottest spells in the state's history.''
   ``We're moving closer to the day when we'll stop using the ocean

dumping is a throwaway approach to our waste problem and

   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., agreed. ``We're treating the oceans
as a cesspool,'' he told the Senate.
   Congress first ordered an end to the ocean dumping of sewage
sludge in 1972. Five years laters, Congress directed that the
dumping be ended by 1981. But the nine municipalities in New York

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday voted to ban disposal of
sewage sludge in the Atlantic Ocean after 1991.
   The measure, passed by voice vote, would set a Dec. 31, 1991,
deadline for dumping in the Atlantic by nine authorities in New
York and New Jersey.
   The bill would impose stiff fines aimed at making the dumping
prohibitively expensive, and use penalty fees to pay for
alternatives.
   ``Today's action means that ocean dumpers have to find
alternatives to using the sea as the world's biggest garbage pail,
or face fines and penalties,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
a principal sponsor of the legislation.
   The measure reconciles differing sludge-dumping bills passed by
the Senate in August and by the House earlier this month.
   A House vote on the compromise could come as soon as Wednesday,
with President Reagan then expected to sign the bill.
   Some 8 million tons of sludge a year are dumped by the nine
agencies at a site about 106 miles east of New Jersey. Congress
closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987.
   The new bill would require dumpers to pay fees of $100 dollars
per ton of sludge beginning next Jan. 1.
   Dumpers, meanwhile, would be required to negotiate with federal
authorities on individual timetables for ending their dumping.
   Those agencies that cannot strike a deal would pay fees that
rise from $100 a ton to $200 a ton by the end of 1991. Any
authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by the start of 1992
would have to pay penalties in addition to the fees.
   Those fines would begin at $600 per ton and rise by 11 percent a
year for continuing violators, rising to total tens of millions of
dollars.
   Congress originally banned ocean sludge dumping as of 1981, but
that deadline was suspended in a successful lawsuit by New York.
The original deadline was set in a 1978 law, after which some 300
industries and 100 municipalities stopped dumping.
   The proposed ban initially was opposed by New York officials,
who complained that the deadline would be impossible to meet.
   But the opposition weakened as a bipartisan coalition of East
Coast lawmakers rallied in favor of a ban.

<HEAD>Palm Beach County Pours Chlorinated Waste Into The Ocean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE WORTH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palm Beach County dumped a million
gallons of chlorinated raw sewage from an affluent suburb into the
Atlantic Ocean rather than let it spill onto property and into
canals.
   ``The two alternatives were not very attractive,'' said Health
Department engineering director Frank Gargiulo. ``One was
discharging sewage on the ground. The other was discharging it into
the ocean.''
   Health department officials banned swimming, surfing and wading
on 13 miles of beach from Singer Island to Lantana for about 24
hours.
   The problem started with the shutdown of a regional treatment
plant early Sunday to bring a new section on line.
   ``This was a planned event,'' Gargiulo said. ``At night, they
don't generate as much sewage.''
   But Lake Worth produced more waste than expected. By 2 a.m.,
officials were worried about it spilling and seeping onto the ground.
   For about three hours, waste flowed from a pumping station
through a pipe that extends about a mile into the Atlantic Ocean,
officials said.
   Dumping raw waste there is illegal, but Gargiulo described the
step as ``the lesser of two evils.''
   Don White, a state Department of Environmental Regulation
official, was present when the waste was discharged. ``They had
emergency approval from us,'' he said Monday.
   ``Up until 25 to 30 years ago, all of the domestic waste from the
Lake Worth area was discharged through that outflow,'' he said,
``but it has not been used for 25 years routinely.''
   White said he didn't know what effect the chlorinated sewage
would have on marine life at the discharge point.
   Gargiulo said the action is not expected to cause health problems.
   ``The ocean is usually a hostile environment for bacteria,'' he
said. ``There is a high salt content and strong currents. We're very
confident that tidal activity during the 24-hour (ban) will cleanse
the area.''
   Some beachgoers seemed equally unconcerned.
   Despite red ``no swimming'' flags, Julio Armas, 26, of West Palm
Beach, took a blue raft into the ocean.
   He said the water probably has been polluted on other days. ``We
just happened to know about it this time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The House voted Wednesday to bar authorities
in New York and New Jersey from disposing sewage sludge in the
Atlantic Ocean after 1991.
   The measure, passed by a voice vote, would impose stiff fines
for any dumping after Dec. 31, 1991. The fines are aimed at making
the dumping prohibitively expensive, and the penalty fees would be
used to pay for alternatives.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said the bill was ``a major
breakthrough in reclaiming our oceans and shores. This legislation
gives local sewage authorities the clear message that they must
find alternatives to ocean dumping _ not sometime in the distant
future, but right now.''
   President Reagan is expected to sign the bill, which is a
compromise between differing sludge-dumping bills passed by the
Senate in August and the House earlier this month.
   Nine agencies in New York and New Jersey dump about 8 million
tons of sludge a year at a site about 106 miles east of New Jersey.
Another site 12 miles offshore was closed in 1987.
   The new bill would set a fee of $100 per ton of sludge dumped
beginning Jan. 1, and the dumpers would be expected to negotiate
with federal authorities toward a timetable to end their dumping.
   Those that cannot work out a deal would see their fees rise to
$200 a ton by the end of 1991.
   Starting in 1992, penalties starting at $600 per ton would be
added to the fees. The penalties would rise by 11 percent a year
for continuing violators, and eventually would total tens of
millions of dollars.
   In 1978, Congress set a 1981 deadline to stop ocean sludge
dumping, but New York sued and got the ban suspended, saying the
deadline would be impossible to meet. However, a bipartisan

<HEAD>EPA Staff Recommends Ocean Dumping Permits, With Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The staff of the Environmental Protection
Agency recommended Friday that permits be issued to nine New York
City-area municipalities which dump treated sewage sludge in the
Atlantic Ocean.
   An EPA hearing officer said authorities should be allowed to
increase dumping sewage to five times their normal rates under bad
weather, up to 15,500 gallons per minute.
   The report also recommends creating two barge tracks inside the
dumping area, rather than the current single track, enabling more
barges to use the dump site simultaneously. The permits would also
reduce the time and distance that must remain between barges.
   ``I believe that these modifications ... while continuing to
provide for maximum protection of the marine environment, result in
a permit which is fully implementable,'' EPA hearing officer Richard
L. Caspe said in his report. ``I do not foresee any environmental
condition which would result in its impracticability or its lack of
environmental protection.''
   The permits, which would be valid until March 17, 1991, must be
approved by the EPA regional administrator, said Herman Phillips, an
agency spokesman in New York.
   Currently, New York City, Westchester and Nassau Counties, and
six sewerage authorities in New Jersey dump more than 8 million wet
tons of sewage sludge annually at a site 106 miles off the New
Jersey coast.
   They are the only municipalities in the United States that dump
sewage sludge in the ocean. The municipalities have been dumping
under a court order issued in 1981, but the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of
1988 makes such dumping illegal after Aug. 14, 1989 unless the
municipality has entered into an agreement with the EPA to phase out
the practice.

SAND BAR WAS ONCE A GLORIOUS ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At low tide, a sand bar peeks out from under the ocean at the mouth of New 
Jersey's Great Bay, the last remnant of an American Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Suter recalls when that sand bar was a magnificent island, a dreamy sort 
of a place with families and beautiful cedar trees and tales of haunted hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Suter, who turns 83 this month, was one of the children who told those ghost 
stories on Tucker's Island. 
</P>
<P>
And she may be the last person alive who can tell from personal experience the 
story of the island, which was swallowed by the sea more than half a century 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
It's a story with a lesson, a reminder that man may live on the Earth and even 
manipulate it, but, in the end, does not control it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful place," Suter said of her childhood home. "But now it's 
gone to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean." 
</P>
<P>
In its glory years, as far back as the late 1700s, Tucker's Island was 5 miles 
long and a mile wide. It boasted a lighthouse, two hotels and a school and was 
a popular spot for sportsmen and vacationers from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The island, north of Atlantic City along the New Jersey coast, was named for 
Rueben Tucker, a Quaker from New York who bought it in 1765. According to John 
Bailey Lloyd, a historian who has written about the lost island in two books, 
wealthy Quakers gathered there for religious retreats in the years following 
the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The island was renamed Sea Haven in the 1870s, when there were plans to develop 
it into a major resort. Those plans were shelved when the nearby town of Beach 
Haven, on another island a few miles to the north, proved to be too much 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Sea Haven's fate as a commercial enterprise was sealed in 1886, when the 
Pennsylvania Railroad ran a line across Barnegat Bay onto Long Beach Island, 
Lloyd said. The tracks ended at Beach Haven and were never extended. 
</P>
<P>
In 1913, when Suter arrived at age 7, the only residents of the once-bustling 
island were a lighthouse keeper, the staff of a lifesaving station and their 
families. The Columbia and St. Alban's hotels had long since closed. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember these two big hotels in disrepair," Suter said. "We kids would say 
they were haunted." 
</P>
<P>
During her first winter there, she lived in a bungalow with her mother and 
father, who worked at the lifesaving station, rescuing shipwrecked sailors. 
</P>
<P>
The family spent a second winter on the island in a houseboat that Suter's 
father towed across the bay from Parkertown. 
</P>
<P>
"We stayed there from September to June," Suter said. "We didn't stay in the 
summer, because there weren't that many shipwrecks. 
</P>
<P>
Suter recalls attending a one-room schoolhouse on the island in 1913 and 1914, 
with about six other children. She has fond memories of walking the desolate 
beaches with her mother, and going fishing in her father's garvey, a small 
scow. 
</P>
<P>
On blustery winter nights, everyone would gather at the lifesaving station, the 
center of the island's social life. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a gramophone and people would sing and dance," she said. "Nowadays, 
people get bored if they don't have a television set. But we had wonderful 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Those times ended in 1915, when the lifesaving station was disbanded and the 
Coast Guard took over Tucker's Island. The family moved back to its house 
across the bay in Parkertown, where Suter had been born and still lives today. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one knew it at the time, the island's days were numbered. On Feb. 
4, 1920, a storm ripped an inlet through Tucker's Beach, a narrow strip of sand 
that formed the tip of Long Beach Island and protected Tucker's Island from the 
fury of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, the inlet widened to the south, consuming Tucker's 
Beach and exposing Tucker's Island to the open sea. The relentless ocean began 
chewing up the island and, one by one, its buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1927, the Little Egg Harbor Light House, which had stood for nearly a 
century, tumbled into the sea. The ever-encroaching ocean forced the Coast 
Guard to evacuate the island in 1930, according to Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's Island officially ceased to exist in 1932, when Long Beach Township 
removed it from the tax rolls. But a small piece of land where the little 
schoolhouse stood survived until 1938, when it was swept away during a winter 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
Now, only the sand bar is left, and many people Suter meets find it hard to 
believe that so picturesque an island ever stood there. 
</P>
<P>
"People will argue with me about Tucker's Island," she said. "But I always tell 
them, 'I know what it was really like. I lived there.' "

   More hospital waste, including intravenous
tubing and vials of blood, washed ashore today on a Long Island
beach, and officials declared it off-limits for swimmers just a few
hours after it was reopened.
   Swimming bans were lifted today on other beaches along a 25-mile
stretch of the island's south shore, facing the Atlantic Ocean, but
officials warned that winds and tides could bring more debris and
force more closings.
   There was no word on where the material came from.
   Meanwhile in New Jersey, officials said Wednesday that five of
the 104 blood-filled vials that washed up on its shores last
weekend contained AIDS-contaminated blood. Another two dozen vials
were found Wednesday.
   The waves of debris that washed up today at Robert Moses State
Park, the easternmost of the affected beaches, were brought in by a
combination of high tide and southwesterly winds, said Michael
Asheroff, deputy regional director of the Long Island State Park
Commission.
   The waste was taken to the state Department of Environmental
Conservation for testing to determine its source.
   Asheroff said the popular Jones Beach and the other beaches
closed Wednesday and then reopened may see waste washing ashore
later this afternoon or by high tide Friday morning.
   Health inspectors, after finding no new debris on beaches this
morning, had decided to reopen them. They also tested the water
quality and found it to be safe, Asheroff said.
   Inspectors from the Suffolk and Nassau county health departments
and the state Department of Environmental Conservation were in
patrol boats looking for clues to the origin of the debris.
   On Wednesday, the Nassau County Health Department recommended
that the state, county and town beaches remain closed to swimming
until the water was determined safe, said Shelly Domash, a
department spokeswoman.
   ``It's the unknown _ you don't know what it is or what it's
carrying,'' said Ronald F. Foley, regional director of the New York
State Parks. ``We wanted to be on the safe side.''
   On a typical weekday, 50,000 to 60,000 people visit Jones Beach
and Robert Moses state parks, with up to 15 percent swimming, he
said. On weekends, as many as 200,000 go to Jones Beach and about
40,000 to Robert Moses, which is 10 miles east.
   A heat wave has just begun, with forecasters predicting
temperatures in the 90s through the weekend.
   Domash said officials were trying to figure out where the debris
came from and whether it was related to the debris that washed up
in New Jersey.
   The last time the parks' beaches were closed in New York was
1976 when sewage washed up, Foley said.
   The New Jersey Health Department announced Wednesday that five
vials discovered last weekend in Bayonne showed evidence of the
AIDS antibody. It was the second time in a month that vials had
washed ashore in New Jersey.
   The presence of the antibody ``does not necessarily indicate
that there is live virus in the blood,'' said Deputy Health
Commissioner Thomas A. Burke.
   Early last month, two of five vials found in Ocean County were
contaminated with AIDS. A third tested positive for hepatitis,
which is substantially more infectious than AIDS.
   Police also said Wednesday they have discovered another two
dozen vials on the Bayonne beach which have been turned over to the
Health Department for analysis. Bayonne is on a bay that feeds into
the Atlantic Ocean.

<LEADPARA>  A group of leading oceanographers gathered here Thursday called for a massive
experiment to test the ocean's potential as a dumping ground for millions of
tons of sewage sludge and toxic waste.;    In a proposal that flies in the
face of public opinion, and challenges traditional ideas about the sanctity of
the seas, the scientists proposed interring garbage in the deep ocean as part
of an "industrial-scale" test of the health and environmental effects of
marine waste disposal.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  General News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DEEP-SEA TEST OF WASTE DUMPING PROPOSED
SCIENTISTS SAY OCEANS COULD SPARE LAND, AIR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Although most scientists would prefer not to dump garbage in the oceans,
researchers meeting here at one of the world's leading marine institutes say
using the deep seas may be one of the only ways to spare the land and air from
additional pollution from landfills and incineration.;    "I don't think
anyone wants to advocate ocean dumping," said Derek Spencer, a senior
scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, who is leading the
campaign to study ocean dumping. "But the waste problem is there and it's not
going away. Indeed, it is going to get far worse. Perhaps the bottom of the
sea is the best place for some wastes. Yet nobody wants to hear that.";   
Ocean dumping has been one of the most reviled ways for disposing of waste.
Congress has banned all ocean dumping starting next year.;    But the
scientists say the dumping ban was propelled by "environmental hysteria." The
deep ocean far from shore, they say, might be a more appropriate place for
certain waste. They argue that the oceans may in fact be a far better place
than landfills on the coast, which pollute inshore waters with runoff,
degrading beaches and fishing grounds.;    The proposal to experiment with
deep-ocean dumping is sure to run into vigorous opposition from Congress and
environmentalists who have fought to protect the oceans.;    "I don't think
this is such a good idea," said Elliott A. Norse, a marine ecologist and chief
scientist at the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington. "There are some
folks who never take no for an answer.";    To research the appropriateness of
using the deep oceans as marine landfill, the scientists and engineers meeting
this week at Woods Hole envision a major collaboration between academia and
foreign financiers.;    In one scenario, a million ton of waste a year or more
would be dumped into the deep oceans for 10 years. Candidates for dumping
include sewage sludge, industrial wastes and the toxic ash left over after
incineration of garbage. A large ship would steam far out into the North
Atlantic or Pacific where it would lower, by capsule, load upon load of
garbage.;    Upon reaching the sea floor, some four or five miles below the
surface, the door of the garbage capsule would open and spill out its
contents. With the help of navigation satellites, the garbage ship would be
able to return to the same site over and over again.;    Spencer and his
colleagues concede that ocean dumping could disturb the ecosystem. But at
least one component of their experiment would be to monitor those effects and
to learn whether the ocean floor recovers after dumping is stopped.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Congress Expected To Act On Sludge-Dumping Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Congress is expected to vote next week on
compromise legislation to ban disposal of sewage sludge in the
ocean by the nation's only remaining ocean dumpers.
   The new agreement, struck Friday by House and Senate conferees,
sets a Dec. 31, 1991, deadline for dumping in the Atlantic by nine
authorities in New York and New Jersey.
   The legislation imposes stiff fines aimed at making the dumping
exorbitantly expensive, and pools the fines to pay for alternatives.
   ``The agreement is tough but fair. Clearly the end of ocean
dumping is in sight,'' said Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., the prime
House sponsor.
   ``This bill is a major step in cleaning up our oceans,'' added
Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J.
   The compromise reconciles differing sludge-dumping bills passed
by the Senate in August and by the House earlier this week.
   Senate and House votes on the compromise are expected Wednesday.
President Reagan is expected to sign the bill.
   Some 8 million tons of sludge a year are dumped by the nine
agencies at a site about 106 miles east of New Jersey. Congress
closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987.
   Experts differ on the environmental threat posed by the dumping
of sludge.
   The new bill requires dumpers to pay fees of $100 per ton of
sludge beginning on Jan. 1 of next year.
   Any authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by 1993 would
have to pay penalties in addition to the fees.

   George Bush stood last Friday with Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey on a beach in Point Pleasant and proclaimed ocean dumping a "national tragedy." 
He thus joined the platoons of public officials who have made haste to echo the public's disgust at the waves of syringes, needles, blood vials and other medical wastes that have been washing up on the beaches of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut this summer. 

   Those admiring Mr. Bush's moral fortitude in making a stand for clean water should temper their emotion with knowledge of what -- as the vice president is fond of saying -- the world is, rather than what it should be. 
Lawrence Bathgate, a lawyer who is finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, New Jersey state finance chairman for the Bush for President Committee and, according to a Bush campaign spokesman, "one of the campaign's single largest fund-raisers" has also helped the interests of Ciba-Geigy, one of the most resolute polluters in the state of New Jersey, with a well-documented international record of outrageous conduct. 

   Every day, through a private pipeline running 10 miles from its dye and resin plant on Toms River, the huge Swiss-owned pharmaceutical company Ciba-Geigy dumps more than four million gallons, or 17,000 tons, of waste into the Atlantic off Ortley Beach. 
From its own discharge permits to Ciba-Geigy, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is aware, that at any given time the effluent may contain lead, chromium, chloronated hydrocarbon and extreme carcinogens such as PCBs and nitrogen-bearing compounds. 
Frank Livelli, a retired chemical-company executive who lives near the pipeline, points out that four million gallons a day in only one year is equivalent to the volume of all the water between the sand beach and 150 feet into the surf for almost the entire coastline of the state of New Jersey. 
And Ciba-Geigy has been dumping for more than 20 years. 

   For most of this period people living in the area were in ignorance of the pipeline's existence, let alone what was passing through it and into the waters in which they and their children swam. 
Then, four years ago, the pipeline broke, ripping up the pavement at Ortley Beach and spewing all over the street. 
Alarmed local residents, like Mr. Livelli, who later helped found Save Our Ocean, soon came upon a 1983 report by the state Department of Environmental Protection which noted that after testing the Ciba-Geigy effluent the Environmental Protection Agency had stated that never before had it seen waste water with so great a potential for causing cancer, heart disease and birth defects. 

   Ciba-Geigy officials deny its operations in any way endanger health and, of course, direct linkages between cause and effect are notoriously difficult to prove conclusively. 

   Particularly disillusioning to Ocean County residents is the extent to which elected officials and those charged with the task of environmental protection have given Ciba-Geigy an easy ride. 
At a meeting with concerned citizens in 1984 the DEP commissioner at the time said that if he found the company was contaminating the ocean he would close the beaches and not the pipeline. 
In May, in legislative hearings on a bill to outlaw the pipeline by Jan. 1, 1990, officials from the DEP actually testified on Ciba-Geigy's behalf, a posture that is truly startling when one reviews Ciba-Geigy's record in the state. 

   In 1972 Ciba-Geigy was slapped with a 206-count indictment for polluting the Toms River and the Atlantic Ocean. 
The company agreed to build a waste-water treatment plant, and so the indictment was dropped. 
This plant may, as Ciba claims, be a state-of-the-art facility for treating biodegradable wastes, but the Toms River operation barely deals in such wastes. 

   In 1978 the DEP and the EPA recognized that there had been serious violations in some monitoring of the company's discharges. 
Ciba assured them it would do better, and the agencies looked the other way. 
At the same time, according to a 35-count indictment issued by the state attorney general, the plant began accepting hazardous wastes from 57 corporate warehouses as well as from some non-Ciba operations throughout the country. 
It then began to dump these through the pipeline, the attorney general has charged in this indictment, in violation of the law. 

   In 1984, acting on an inside tip, state police raided the plant and found 14,000 barrels of liquid hazardous waste for which the company had no permit. 
This resulted, a year later, in a 35-count indictment for conspiracy to defraud and deceive the DEP, falsification of documents in order to obtain and keep operating permits, and illegally dumping known and unknown hazardous chemicals through the pipeline, on its site and in its landfill. 
Four company executives were named as co-conspirators. 
This indictment is now the subject of a continuing legal wrangle, so the attorney general has since brought another indictment, which has not reached trial. 

   Yet in 1985, while under indictment and despite the fact that it did not meet the minimum standards set by the Clean Water Act and New Jersey state law, Ciba-Geigy got a new five-year permit for ocean discharge from the DEP. No doubt heartened by this compliance, the company this year applied for six new permits to bring to Toms River a pharmaceutical operation that has destroyed the Pawtuxet River and fouled the air in Cranston, R.I. 
By 1981 the lower end of the Pawtuxet, into which Ciba-Geigy had been pouring 1.2 million gallons of waste each day, could support only those organisms that flourish in sewage and toxic waste. 
Ciba-Geigy is an itinerant of opportunity. 
Having fouled up the Pawtuxet and Toms rivers, the company says it's now planning to move its dye operations to St. Gabriel, La., by 1990, making some offensive propaganda in the process about the burden of environmental regulation. 

   In June the company got a tremendous boost from the EPA when Chris Dagget, the agency's regional director, argued to members of the State Assembly that the pipeline needed to remain open as an option for cleaning up the Ciba-Geigy Superfund site, which has contaminated over 1,000 wells, forcing homeowners to depend on bottled water. 

   This summer the air has been thick with cries from politicians of their dedication to the public weal. 
Mr. Bush made his vows on the Atlantic's edge and not so long ago Michael Dukakis stood in the same place saying the same thing. 
Such abstract talk is easy. 
Meanwhile, Ciba-Geigy's effluent spills steadily, year after year, into the sea, a squalid reminder of the fact that it's one thing to talk about a better America and quite another to do serious battle with the forces that make it worse. 
In May the state Senate passed the pipeline bill, but earlier this month 34 members of the Assembly abstained from a crucial vote, leaving the bill in limbo until September, when sessions reconvene. 
On Saturday, Save Our Ocean is holding a memorial service for the ocean at Ortley Beach, south of Point Pleasant, on the barrier island. 
Tuesday, the EPA will hold hearings at Toms River High School on proposals for cleaning up the Superfund site.

   Nassau County must pay a $180,000 fine for
failing to meet deadlines for ending ocean dumping of sludge, the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday.
   The county, under a court agreement, had been required to award
two sets of contracts by May 15 _ one to acquire sludge dewatering
equipment and a second to build sludge dewatering facilities.
   Failure to award the contracts triggered penalties that
accumulated at a rate of $2,000 a day from May 15 through June 13,
then $10,000 a day from June 14 through June 25, the EPA said.
Nassau has paid the $180,000 into an escrow account.
   Had the county begun building its sludge dewatering plant by
June 30, the penalties would have been forgiven.
   EPA Regional Administrator Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff said the
penalties will continue building and will reach $420,000 on July 25.
   Nassau is one of nine areas in New York and New Jersey that dump
more than 8 million tons of sewage yearly into an Atlantic Ocean
site 115 miles off New Jersey. The eight other authorities are on
or close to schedule for ending their ocean dumping, the EPA said.

SEWAGE SPILL CLOSES 2 MILES OF BEACHES

A 2-mile stretch of beach from Ocean Beach to Mission Beach was closed Friday 
and could be shut down for most of the weekend because a corroded pipe burst, 
sending 50,000 gallons of sewage sludge into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches affected are between Del Monte Avenue in Ocean Beach and Ventura 
Place in Mission Beach, right near the Giant Dipper roller coaster, said Lt. 
Charles Wright, a San Diego city lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
The beach area in Ocean Beach is scheduled to be closed until Monday, but 
Mission Beach could reopen as early as this afternoon, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
A hole, 3 inches wide and 8 inches long, sent the treated sewage into the San 
Diego River flood channel, where it flowed into the ocean, said Dan Child, a 
waste-water treatment superintendent with the city's Water Utilities 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The section of pipe that broke was on Sea World Drive on the north side of the 
flood channel. 
</P>
<P>
It is part of an 8-mile-long pipe that carries 800,000 gallons of sewage daily 
from the city's sewage-treatment plant on Point Loma to sludge-drying basins on 
Fiesta Island, Child said. 
</P>
<P>
The first report of the break came in about 8:45 a.m. Pumps were shut down, 
stopping the rush of sewage in about an hour, Child said. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches were closed because the bacteria in the sewage contaminated the 
water, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no real way to clean it up," Wright said. "It becomes diluted over 
time in the ocean and the bacteria counts are reduced to the point of not being 
dangerous anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Signs are posted on the beaches warning people to stay out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to becoming sick, people who ignore the signs could be arrested, 
Wright said.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To End Sludge Dumping By 1993</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday passed a much-debated
bill that bans the dumping of sewage sludge in the ocean after 1992.
   The measure, adopted by a 416-0 vote, sets a Dec. 31, 1992
deadline on sludge dumping by the nation's only remaining
practitioners: nine sewage authorities located in New York and New
Jersey.
   The compromise bill, climaxing a 10-year legislative effort,
must now be reconciled with a differing version passed by the
Senate in August.
   Sponsors of the House and Senate bills say they expect to
reconcile differences at conference sessions beginning Wednesday.
Among other things, the Senate bill sets a Dec. 31, 1991 deadline _
a year earlier than the House.
   ``I think there's room for compromise,'' said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., sponsor of the Senate version.
   Under the House plan, drafted by a bipartisan coalition of East
Coast lawmakers, sludge dumpers would be forced to stop by the 1992
deadline or face stiff penalties.
   ``These penalties will add up to tens of millions of dollars in
a very short time. There's no question but that the fines will make
it financially prohibitive for municipalities to continue dumping
in the ocean beyond the deadline,'' said Rep. William Hughes,
D-N.J., a prime sponsor of the ban.
   Rep. H. James Saxton, R-N.J., called the bill, ``a vitory in the
continuing fight for clean oceans.''
   Some eight million wet tons of sludge a year are dumped by the
nine agencies at a site about 106 miles east of New Jersey.
Congress closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987.
   Experts differ on the environmental threat posed by the dumping
of sludge.
   The new bill imposes fees to dumpers of $200 a ton beginning
Jan. 1, 1989.
   Dumpers meanwhile would be required to negotiate individual
timetables for ending their dumping with federal authorities.
   Those agencies that cannot strike a deal will pay staggered fees
through 1992 of up to $400 a ton.
   Any authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by 1993 would be
forced to pay penalties over and above the fees. Those fines begin
at $800 per ton and more than double that by 1999.
   New York alone would be liable for more than $1.3 billion if the
state is still dumping by the year 2000.
   The proposed ban was at first opposed by New York lawmakers and
New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, who complained that the deadline
would be impossible to meet.
   Proponents countered that Congress orginally banned ocean sludge
dumping as of 1981, a deadline suspended in a successful lawsuit by
New York. The original deadline was set in a 1978 law, after which
some 300 industries and 100 municipalities stopped dumping.
   The compromise was reached after inclusion of a system of trust
funds, under which fees and fines would be used to develop
alternatives to dumping.
   The political climate became right for the bill this year, after
repeated and widely-publicized incidents of beach pollution.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Friday signed legislation
designed to end the dumping of sewage sludge in the ocean by 1992.
   The bill is aimed at closing the nation's last remaining sludge
dumping site, some 106 miles off the New Jersey coast.
   The only agencies affected by the new legislation are three
regional sewage authorities in New York, including New York City,
and six authorities in northern New Jersey.
   No other jurisdiction in the nation still dumps its sludge at sea.
   Under the measure, the agencies must end their dumping by Dec.
31, 1991, or pay stiff penalties amounting potentially to millions
of dollars.
   Meanwhile, the dumpers will begin next year to pay increased
fees, separate from potential penalties, for use of the ocean as a
dump site.
   Both the fees and fines, if needed, will be pooled to help
develop alternate disposal methods.
   Reagan's signing of the bill, without comment, climaxes a 10-year
legislative effort to halt the dumping. Congress voted a first ban
in 1978, effective in 1981, which was successfully challenged in
federal court by New York. The dumping has continued under court
authority since.
   New York lawmakers and New York Mayor Edward I. Koch opposed the
new measure, but ultimately agreed to a compromise in the face of
mounting congressional pressure.
   ``Ocean dumping is one of the most insidious forms of pollution
ever inflicted on the environment,'' said Rep. William Hughes,
D-N.J., the principal author of the bill, after it was signed into
law.
   ``We're taking big strides in our effort to clean up the ocean,''
added Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the chief Senate sponsor.
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said, ``The environmental health of the
oceans and the economic health of the fishing industry demand that
we end the dumping.''

   An F-14 Tomcat jet fighter crashed in the
Atlantic Ocean Monday, and one crewman was killed and the other
missing, the Navy said.
   A fishing vessel, Jo-Boy II, managed to pick up one crewman, but
he was pronounced dead when he arrived by helicopter at Portsmouth
Naval Hospital in Virginia, authorities said.
   A search continued late Monday for the second flier.
   The F-14 based at Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia Beach,
Va., went down 22 miles east of Oregon Inlet, said Navy spokesman
P.E. Wilkinson.
   The plane, part of Oceana's Fighter Squadron 143, was practicing
air combat maneuvers with several other planes, said Lt. Cmdr. Mike
John, spokesman for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet air force.
   The identities of the dead man and the missing man were withheld
pending notification of relatives.
   Two charter boat captains carrying fishing parties watched from
several miles away as the F-14 hit the water.
   ``I saw a streak of flame and a great big fireball about 500
feet from the surface,'' said Warren Gallop, captain of the Mighty
Wind, which is based at the Oregon Inlet Fishing Center. ``I heard
an explosion and I could see stuff flying through the air. It
sounded like a big boom. It scattered stuff over a wide area.''
   John said the $35 million aircraft sank soon after impact.

<TEXT>
   To most of us, it's an innocuous strip of blue
that separates the United States and Europe on the world map, or
that tedious nothingness that takes hours to go by outside the
window of an airplane.
   But the Atlantic Ocean, a shifting, churning, life-giving,
living character, is the star of an ambitious new, three-part
series, ``Atlantic Realm,'' beginning tonight on PBS.
   The first episode, ``Island Arks,'' examines the origins of the
ocean, from its beginnings some 165 million years ago as little
more than a river separating two continents before they began to
drift apart.
   The series offers scientific and historical data on the
evolution of the ocean, but is thankfully taken up more with superb
photography of wildlife the ocean has spawned than by maps and
charts. One of the highlights of the first episode is the birth of
a litter of lemon sharks in the shallows near the Bahamas, an event
never before photographed in the wild.
   Life above the sea is featured in the first episode, especially
the myriad sea birds that live on islands off the coast of Africa
where the delicate ebb and flow of the ecology is easily observed _
such as the environmental upheaval caused when mariners introduced
domesticated cats to one small island.
   The series is engrossing and lovely to watch, despite
occasionally overwrought narrative, such this sample from a segment
on Iceland: ``Solidified lava is one of the raw materials of the
Earth. Forged in fire, it's stern but ready to accept the life that
pioneers its surface. Below, the Atlantic marine organisms would
exploit this new territory, but here, laid bare to the winds of the
air, lichens, mosses and herbs have taken hold along this broad and
rolling swath of the salt that is part of the mid-Atlantic ridge.''
   Phew. Narrator Marty Robinson manages to read such passages with
aplomb if not a breath.
   The series, a joint production of WTTW in Chicago and the BBC,
was created by Rod Redfern, who wrote the book ``The Making of a
Continent'' on which a previous, six-part PBS television series was
based.
   ``I was looking for something to follow `The Making of a
Continent,''' said Redfern in a statement about ``Atlantic Realm,''
``and the obvious thing was the making of an ocean.'' Redfern's
book on the Atlantic is due out soon.
   Next week's episode, ``Ocean of Light,'' focuses on the effects
of the winds that brush the top of ocean and the life forms that
live near the surface, including whales. The cameras go the
Antarctic for first-time pictures of the underwater ballet of
Weddell seals. Later, they capture the flow of translucent animals
that drift along the surface of the open ocean.
   ``Into the Abyss'' is the series' big finish, with cameras
diving a half-mile below the ocean's surface to examine the strange
creatures that dwell in the lightless depths. The cameras also take
viewers to the longest submerged mountain range on Earth and take a
peek inside an underwater volcano.

   Elsewhere in television:
   FOR THE BIRDS _ The life of wildlife illustrator John James
Audubon will be the subject of two two-hour television films, ``The
Flight of Imagination,'' in development by Herb Schmertz in New
York and Richard Price in London. The scripts will be based on
Claude Chebel's fictionalized biography ``Audubon.'' ...
   `MOLLY' GAINS GAYNES _ Allyn Ann McLerie, who plays Molly Dodd's
mother on Lifetime's ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' has a
love interest in the series' new episodes on the cable channel.
He's played by McLerie's real-life husband, George Gaynes
(``Tootsie,'' ``Police Academy''). ...
   `WISEGUY' _ Patti D'Arbanville, who had been guest-starring in
the rock 'n' roll storyline on CBS' ``Wiseguy,'' will play a
recurring character in the crime drama, says CBS, noting, ``how and
why this happens remains a mystery: `Wiseguy' writers hold the
key.'' ... Speaking of ``Wiseguy,'' Viewers for Quality Television,
a Virginia-based group that defends high-caliber if low-rated
television series, has put its seal of approval on the series. VQT
director Dorothy Swanson calls ``Wiseguy'' ``brilliant and
cerebral.'' ...
   WHO'S HOUSE IS HOMIEST? _ Hope and Michael's Philly fixer-upper
on ABC's ``thirtysomething'' is the coziest of TV houses, according
to a survey of New York designers and architects queried by
Metropolis magazine. Next on the list was Cliff and Clair
Huxtable's Brooklyn townhouse on NBC's ``The Cosby Show.'' The Rube
Goldberg-style ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse'' on CBS was not far behind _
but then what decorator could resist a talking armchair?

   A fiery George Bush stepped up his
attack on opponent Michael Dukakis' environmental record today,
accusing him of trying to pollute the New Jersey waters where
sewage has washed up on the beach this summer.
   The Republican presidential nominee spoke on a sunny beach that
in the past has been closed because of medical waste and sewage
washing ashore.
   Bush referred to the 1985 request from Dukakis as governor of
Massachusetts to dump his state's sewage off the New Jersey coast
at a site used by New Jersey and New York.
   Bush told a few hundred supporters in beach attire that the next
time Dukakis visits the state they should ``be sure to ask him why
did you want to dump Boston sludge off our coast in New Jersey. ...
Why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of New Jersey when
your own state applied to pollute it?''
   Speaking on Thursday in Norwalk, Conn., of what he called the
``natural heritage that we all have to do something about,'' Bush
called himself a `Teddy Roosevelt Republican'' on the environment.
Roosevelt was an avid conservationist responsible for setting aside
millions of acres of forests and launching irrigation and
reclamation projects.
   Aware that Republicans and the Reagan administration in
particular are a target of unrelenting criticism by environmental
groups, Bush declared nonetheless, ``We're not going to give this
constituency away to the Democrats.''
   He recalled his acceptance speech at the Republican convention
last month when he said he wanted to make the United States ``a
gentler nation.''
   ``This is part of what I mean, a nation in which all of us treat
the environment with greater reverence and greater respect,'' he
said.
   Today Bush was continuing his effort to pull votes from the
environmentally-minded with speeches to residents of Belmar Beach
and later in New Castle, Del.
   Bush sought to embarrass Dukakis on a day when the Boston Herald
headlined a new poll that put him neck-and-neck with the governor
in Massachusetts.
   ``Fantastic,'' Bush said when reporters showed him the newspaper.
   ``I can't believe it,'' he said. ``In Massachusetts?''
   The Herald survey found Dukakis and Bush tied in the state at 42
percent each. The poll of 400 likely voters conducted Wednesday had
a 5-point margin of error.
   A poll for the Herald in July found Dukakis leading by 14
percentage points.
   In his Boston Harbor tour, Bush laid the fault on Dukakis for
failing to clean up the harbor, which has become a major
embarrassment to the state, with half a billion gallons of raw
sewage being dumped in daily. Construction of new wastewater
treatment facilities is now beginning under federal court order.
   He said Dukakis had been intent on delay, to do ``anything but
clean up'' the sewage and sludge and twice sought federal waivers
of the Clean Air Act requirement for secondary treatment of sewage.
   ``I don't call that leadership, and I certainly don't call that
competence,'' he said in reference to Dukakis' statement that
voters should look for competence in this presidential race.
   In his first term as governor Dukakis prepared a waiver request
to the federal government, but it actually was filed by his
successor Gov. Ed King in 1979.
   Dukakis filed the second waiver request in 1984. In 1985, the
Environmental Protection Agency sued the state to force a cleanup.
   Bush also criticized Dukakis for promising to end the dumping
that has left medical waste cluttering New Jersey beaches, when
Dukakis himself as governor asked for federal permission to dump
waste off New Jersey.
   ``The stealth candidate is at it again, making promises on one
hand but hiding his secret record on the other,'' Bush said.
   The 1985 Massachusetts request to the EPA was for temporary
permission to dump 106 miles offshore where New York and New Jersey
were already dumping. A compromise arrangement allowed
Massachusetts to dump further out beyond the continental shelf.
   Standing on a Boston ferry boat off of Deer Island, the future
site of a new sewage treatment plant near the harbor mouth, Bush
called for a ban on ocean dumping of sewage sludge after 1991, and
for greater Coast Guard efforts and FBI participation in catching
violators.

   The summer of '88 is already over in the minds
of countless Northeastern beach lovers revolted by a tide of dead
rats, syringes and sewage that has left miles of shoreline deserted
and seaside businesses shuttered even on the hottest days.
   ``They finally did it _ they ruined the beach,'' said Joe
Lovecchi of Brooklyn. He will limit his ocean dips to ``ankles only
for the rest of the season.''
   Others are not so brave. Attendance has plummeted at Atlantic
beaches since the scare began July 6, when needles and vials of
blood, some of which tested positive for the AIDS virus, began
washing up along Long Island's 120-mile southern shore.
   Since then, on beaches from New Jersey to Massachusetts,
lifeguards and rangers with rakes and rubber gloves have harvested
gruesome garbage after nearly every high tide.
   ``Whoever did this is the Typhoid Mary of garbage carters,''
said New York City Parks Commissioner Henry Stern. ``This has
ruined the summer for millions of people.''
   Although health officials say chances of contracting AIDS from
ocean-borne waste are almost nil, in New York officials are playing
it safe. When needles are found, the beach is closed for at least
two relatively ``clean'' high tides.
   Rhode Island beaches remained open after syringes, catheter and
colostomy bags and intravenous tubing washed up last week;
scientists doing computer studies of ocean currents said the waste
was probably dumped near New York in June.
   Medical waste is not the only reason beaches have closed.
Beaches around Asbury Park, N.J., were closed because of
contamination from human waste, which is a more potent threat to
public health than hospital waste.
   As in past summers, high levels of fecal coliform bacteria also
have forced beaches to close on Long Island and around Boston
harbor.
   John Rafferty, a New York City lifeguard, said he will enter the
water only when his job requires it.
   ``I'm not afraid of AIDS. It's just dirty water. The water's
been dirty for years. I don't enjoy swimming in it,'' he said.
``You come out and you don't feel refreshed.''
   Lovecchi has taken the same position. ``Why take a chance? It's
not just AIDS, but hepatitis, a host of things,'' he said. ``If
they opened up a stand selling Clorox, they could sell out to
people who want to wash their feet.''
   Bleach might sell, but hot dogs and beers are not in demand at
deserted beaches.
   ``It's real bad,'' said Wayne Horner, who operates the food
concession at Jacob Riis Park in Queens, where attendance is down
from a million last July to 457,000 this month. Horner said sales
are down by two-thirds. ``Nobody's coming out and there's nothing
we can do.''
   Fear and confusion did not prevent Loli Reyna of Queens from
taking her two young children to the beach last week.
   ``If they get scared of the ocean now, they're never going to go
in again,'' she said. ``Nobody gets AIDS at the beach. You use
drugs and needles, you get AIDS.''
   Problems with sewage plants also have contributed to the beach
crisis. An old sewage plant in Asbury Park overflowed and dumped
waste into the ocean; the nearby town of Bradley Beach is now
threatening to sue Asbury Park for lost business.
   Heavy rains are being blamed for drowning dozens of sewer rats
that washed ashore in New York. While they have determined that the
rats didn't come from a lab, officials haven't pinpointed the
source of the medical garbage.
   ``It's real possible all the material came from the same
source,'' said New York City Sanitation Commissioner Brendan
Sexton. ``There are particular outlets and people we are watching.''
   Among lifeguards, who frequently outnumbered sunbathers last
week, there was an almost fatalistic consensus: Tidal debris is not
new and garbage of all kinds will continue to wash ashore as long
as offshore dumping continues.
   ``Things have been washing up for a long time, but AIDS is
scaring people so much they are blowing it out of proportion,''
said lifeguard George Triffon.

<HEAD>Congress Expected To Pass Legislation To Combat Medical Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With uncharacteristic speed, Congress is
expected in its final weeks to create a new law to combat what has
become one of the biggest and most emotional problems of the summer
of '88 _ medical waste that has invaded and shut down some of
America's favorite beaches.
   Intense pressure from outraged citizens has driven Congress to
hold a series of public hearings, including one this week on Long
Island's Jones Beach, and at least one measure and maybe more will
be passed before the legislative year ends, lawmakers and
environmental activists predicted.
   Separate measures to create a waste tracking system and to
establish specific criminal penalties for medical waste dumping
passed the Senate before the August recess. Similar measures are
pending in various House committees.
   ``With all the publicity this has gotten, these will sail right
through,'' said John Catena, a science policy analyst at the
Oceanic Society, a national environmental group that focuses on
coastal problems.
   ``The fact that you had one of the hottest summers in 50 years
and tens of millions of people ... were unable to make use of the
public beaches really drew the issue right home,'' said Andy Kass,
a researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, a Democrat who represents part of the
Connecticut coast along the Long Island Sound, said another reason
for the unusual speed on Capitol Hill is the clarity of the issue.
   ``There's no reputable other side of the issue,'' said Morrison.
``No one can excuse the presence of medical waste in the ocean and
the only way it can get there is from illegal dumping. ... There's
not a lot of technical debate here. We know what we can do. Let's
do it.''
   Environmentalists concede that the medical waste problem poses
much less of a long-term health threat than other issues plaguing
the nation's coastal waters, such as sludge dumping, that have
languished in Congress for years.
   ``In terms of long-term survival of the ocean, it's not a
serious problem. In terms of impact on people's lives, it is,''
said Andrew Palmer of the American Oceans Campaign, another
activist group.
   Catena said medical waste simply is ``a much more visible issue.
When it closes your beach down, that makes a lot more rumblings.''
   Many environmentalists see a silver lining in the dirty
syringes, vials, bandages and other hospital debris that has washed
ashore from Massachusetts to the Gulf of Mexico.
   Palmer said public outrage over medical waste has been
transferred to other less well known but potentially more dangerous
coastal pollution problems.
   ``We're seeing it already, and I think that's being translated
to Congress,'' he said.
   Catena said a bill banning sludge dumping off the New York-New
Jersey shore was passed by the Senate last month because of the
attention surrounding medical waste.
   ``It's helpful, no question about it,'' said Sen. John H.
Chafee, R-R.I., a leader in the medical waste fight in Congress.
``It has probably been the best single item to draw attention to
abuse of the oceans.''
   Since incidents of medical waste pollution began making
headlines around the Fourth of July weekend, the Senate has passed
a measure by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Chafee to require
hospitals, transporters and disposal companies to adhere to a
manifest system that would give investigators a paper trail to find
the source of illegal dumping.
   The pilot program would cover New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut _ states where much of the dumping is suspected of
taking place. A similar measure is pending in the House.
   The Senate also approved amendments to a sludge dumping bill
that would create criminal penalties of up to $250,000 in fines and
five years in prison for illegal dumping. A House subcommittee has
approved a similar measure.
   Other bills still pending would set up a series of rules for the
handling, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of
hospital waste.
   But Catena warned that proper funding levels must be made
available to back up any new laws.
   ``It's great to have a law issued to address a problem, but if
we don't have the money to enforce it, it's not worth the paper
it's printed on,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Will No Longer Dump Medical Waste At Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has ordered ships in the Atlantic
Ocean to stop dumping medical waste at sea, in response to
complaints involving waste that washed ashore.
   Earlier this summer, beaches in New York and New Jersey were
closed after a large quantity of waste washed ashore. The Navy was
not blamed in the dumping.
   The Navy admitted Aug. 8 that medical waste was dumped from two
Norfolk-based ships after personnel from the Navy and the Marines
were used to clean up a 26-mile stretch of North Carolina beaches
from Fort Macon to Emerald Isle. Sailors and Marines collected what
the Navy said was a trashbag full of medical supplies.
   Adm. Frank B. Kelso, head of the 300-ship Atlantic fleet, said
Monday he sent a message to all commands on Saturday to cease
dumping at sea.
   ``While only one of these incidents involved a small quantity of
medical waste attributed to Atlantic Fleet ships, these incidents
clearly dictate increased emphasis on proper disposal of all types
of waste,'' Kelso said.
   Regulations will be adopted immediately by ship commanders that
would require special handling of all potentially infectious
medical waste, he said.
   Kelso defined potentially infectious waste as disposable medical
supplies designed for use in diagnosis, treatment, laboratory
testing or training. Those items will include all sharp objects,
containers of blood and blood products, pathology specimens and
tissue, he said.

<HEAD>Attorneys General Say Bush Must Attack Ocean Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorneys general of New York and New Jersey
_ where beaches were littered by medical waste and other pollution
last summer _ have presented an anti-pollution plan they hope will
become a blueprint for a national program.
   Cary Edwards of New Jersey and Robert Abrams of New York said
Monday that the Bush administration will have to lead an aggressive
attack if the nation's oceans and beaches are to be cleaned up.
   ``The president-elect said he was going to do things differently
than the present administration,'' said Abrams. ``He said he was
going to do more vigorous enforcement. We are going to push for this
agenda. Our role is to be the people's advocate.''
   The two officials said attorneys general from around the country
would lobby for the plan, ``A Blueprint to End Ocean Pollution,'' to
be adopted as comprehensive national anti-pollution program. The
plan was issued by the National Association of Attorneys General,
which Abrams heads.
   ``We once felt the oceans were so big we could not destroy them,
but we're now realizing that's not the case,'' said Abrams.
   Added Edwards, ``Anybody who thinks they can stop the dumping of
syringes and they're going to clean up the ocean, they're crazy.''
   Edwards said his investigation into the source of debris that
turned up on the Jersey shore in the summers of 1987 and 1988 found
that ``there was no mad dumper. The mad dumper was the American
lifestyle.
   ``The federal government and the EPA must weigh in on the
problem,'' he added. ``It can't be dealt with alone by any
individual states.''
   The blueprint offers proposals to:
   _Upgrade sewage treatment plants.
   _Remove toxins from industrial waste water.
   _Promote recycling.
   _Control runoff from fertilizer, pesticides and other chemicals.
   _Expand research on water quality.
   _Increase Coast Guard surveillance to prevent ocean dumping.
   _Aggressively enforce existing anti-pollution laws.
   Edwards said a top priority was ending sewage overflow, or the
dumping of raw or poorly treated sewage into bodies of water when
sewage treatment plants are overwhelmed by the volume of waste water
during storms.
   Ending the dumping of sewage sludge at sea is another priority,
the two men said.

<HEAD>Hurricane Experts Watching Two Tropical Depressions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasters at the National Weather Service
hurricane center were watching two tropical depressions that formed
in the Atlantic Ocean on Saturday.
   One formed at midday about 150 miles southeast of the
southernmost Cape Verde islands, off the African coast, and was
moving west at 15 to 20 mph. It was expected to continue that
movement and gradually strengthen, the weather service said.
   The depressions's highest sustained winds were estimated at
about 30 mph, with higher gusts in squalls.
   The second depression was just south of St. Vincent in the
Windward Islands, which are in the Lesser Antilles, and was moving
west at near 15 mph. Highest sustained winds were estimated at 30
mph, but the depression was expected to strengthen as it moved into
the Eastern Caribbean on Sunday.
   The weather service urged small boats in the Windward Islands to
stay in port.
   Depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when their
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74
mph. There have been three tropical storms so far in the 1988
Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, but none reached hurricane
strength.
   Meanwhile, a tropical wave _ a weather system weaker than a
tropical depression _ was moving northwest Saturday after dumping
almost 6{ inches of rain in West Palm Beach on Friday. Showers and
thunderstorms from the wave were expected to leave as much as four
inches of rain over parts of Central and North Florida by Saturday
night.

   Early this century, diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic Ocean was a day at the beach. 
Men would crawl in the sand looking for shiny stones. 
It was as easy as collecting sea shells at Malibu. 

   Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes, searching for that unusual glint. 
But only after a fleet of 336 gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's diamond kingpins, do their work. 
Last year, 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover 934,242 carats, which comes to 46 tons of sand per carat, or one-fifth gram. 
Oh yes, the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards. 

   "If there's diamonds out there, we'll get to them," says Les Johns, De Beers's engineering manager. 

   Here, wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world's most inhospitable diamond dig, lies the earth's most precious jewel box. 
Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa's interior, then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- 98% of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality. 
While other mines might yield more carats, a higher percentage of them go to industrial use. 

   Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault, it has been turned into one. 
Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations. 
When the Germans lost World War I, they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers. 
Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers's stingy approval. 

   The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa. 
Ghost towns dot the Namib dunes, proving diamonds aren't forever. 
Oranjemund, the mine headquarters, is a lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents. 
Jackals roam the streets at night, and gemsbok, hardy antelope with long straight horns, wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers. 
On most days, the desert's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag. 
The wind, stinging with sand, never seems to stop. 

   Still, miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers's head offices in South Africa and London keep coming. 
And Oranjemund boasts attractions besides diamonds. 
There are six video rental shops, three restaurants, one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling. 
The pride of Oranjemund is the 18-hole golf course -- with the largest sand trap in the world. 
Last year, when the rising Orange River threatened to swamp the course, the same engineers who are pushing back the Atlantic rushed to build a wall to hold back the flood. 
"Nothing is too good for our golf course," says Tony George, a mining engineer. 

   Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government following next month's elections freeing the country from South African control, De Beers engineers are working to extend the mine's productive life for another 25 years, from the current estimate of 10. 

   Huge machines that look as though they came from the Star Wars desert-battle scene lumber among the dunes. 
Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator, with buckets instead of seats, chews through layers of compacted sand; tracks and conveyor belts, shuttling sand to the screening plants, criss-cross the beach. 

   Then there is the artifical sea wall, 600 yards long and 60 yards thick, jutting into the ocean. 
Made of sand, it receives around-the-clock maintainence against the battering waves. 
When the mining in front of the wall is complete, it is moved northward. 
A companion jetty that helps hold back the sea looks like a rusting junkyard. 
Engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier, but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood. 
Then someone decided to try broken-down earthmoving equipment that, inexplicably, held against the waves. 

   "The Caterpillar people aren't too happy when they see their equipment used like that," shrugs Mr. George. 
"They figure it's not a very good advert." 

   Despite all these innovations, most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named "bedrock sweepers" who toil in the wake of the excavators. 
Laboring in blue and gray overalls, they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices, and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds. 
But should they spy one, the company will pay a bonus equal to one-third its value. 
For these workers at the bottom of the mine's pay scale, this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them up to 15 years in jail. 

   Still, employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or two. 
One man wrapped several diamonds in the knot of his tie. 
Another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe. 
A food caterer stashed stones in the false bottom of a milk pail. 
None made it past the body searches and X-rays of mine security.

   The Reagan administration says ``education and
guidance'' should be sufficient to halt the waves of dirty needles
and other infectious debris that have made East Coast beach
closures routine this summer.
   Jeffrey D. Denit of the Environmental Protection Agency said
Tuesday that the agency has no plans to impose regulations for
medical waste disposal, despite a chorus of congressional criticism
and public complaints.
   He told a House subcommittee that educational efforts will
remain the administration's key to fighting the medical waste
problem and federal regulations will be used only if those fail.
   But the congressional Office of Technology Assessment said
continuing reports of hospital waste floating up on shores from
Massachusetts to North Carolina are graphic reminders of a
beleaguered system that lacks federal standards.
   ``No federal standards exist which comprehensively address the
handling, transportation, treatment and disposal of biomedical
waste,'' said Kathryn D. Wagner, an analyst for OTA, the technical
research arm of Congress. She added that ``less than a handful (of
states) have truly comprehensive regulations.''
   OTA, in a preliminary assessment of the nation's biomedical
waste problem, said the debris-ridden beaches are ``symptoms of a
deeper problem of inconsistency, confusion and a lack of
coordination both at and between every level of management.''
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the House Small Business
subcommittee on regulation and business opportunities, called the
hearing in the wake of a recent spate of beach closings.
   Beaches in New Jersey and New York have been the hardest hit,
but hospital debris also has been reported in Connecticut, Rhode
Island, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina and on the Lake
Erie shore in Ohio.
   ``This summer's medical waste problem is far more serious than
the bloody syringes and vile specimens that have washed up,'' Wyden
said. ``These foul products are only the residue of a national
waste management system that is broken and overloaded.''
   Wyden accused federal agencies of ``bungling'' the medical waste
problem and attacked EPA for failing to set minimum standards for
handling, transporting and disposing of medical wastes under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
   He also said the federal Centers for Disease Control have failed
to recommend guidelines for waste handling and that the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration has not acted to
protect health care workers from exposure to AIDS and hepatitis.
   But Denit said EPA rejects mandatory regulations.
   ``EPA's ongoing educational and technical assistance efforts
should be sufficient to resolve these issues,'' said Denit, deputy
director of the Office of Solid Waste. ``EPA will consider
regulations only if education and guidance fail to improve current
management practices.''
   Denit added that studies indicate hospital waste is ``generally
less virulent than typical domestic waste.''
   Nevertheless, Congress is considering a variety of measures to
toughen penalties and create a system to track hospital waste.
   The Senate voted 97-0 Tuesday to ban the dumping of sludge off
the New York-New Jersey coast after 1991. The measure included an
amendment by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., banning the
disposal of medical waste in oceans and streams and another by Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., providing a five-year prison sentence for
anyone caught violating the ban.
   OTA researchers plan to issue a report early next year on solid
waste issues, including medical waste. But in a preliminary
briefing given by Wagner to the subcommittee, the agency concluded:
   _Lack of federal regulation has created a situation in which
states, fearful that a neighboring state's more stringent law would
bring added medical waste to their jurisdictions, are
``leap-frogging one another to adopt the most stringent
regulations.''
   _Evidence exists that hospitals and other health-care employers,
in an attempt to limit liability, are requiring workers to sign
forms stating they have been trained in handling infectious
materials after receiving only minimal training.
   _The majority of biomedical waste is now incinerated on-site,
but increasing state emission control regulations may lead more
hospitals to hire waste haulers, creating the potential for more
transportation hazards and abuse by contractors trying to save
money by dumping the waste in the ocean.
   Rhode Island Attorney General James E. O'Neil showed the
subcommittee a respirator tube, a colostomy bag, a blood-encrusted
needle and other hospital waste that state officials have collected
in recent weeks from Rhode Island's shores.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman called for strict
federal penalties and jail sentences for illegal dumpers and a
manifest system to track the route of hospital throwaways.
   ``Infectious waste is essentially a loaded gun and should be
legally recognized as such,'' Holtzman said.

<HEAD>Koch Seeks Compromise on Sludge-Dumping Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Mayor Edward I. Koch has
characterized as ``savage'' and ``less savage'' a pair of bills
that would call for an end to sludge dumping in the ocean by 1993,
but he urged the two be rolled into one to make the city's fight
easier.
   ``We hope that when the bill comes to the floor it will be one
bill, the two (committee) chairs will compromise out their
differences and that we don't have to fight on every level, front
and back and on all sides,'' Koch said Friday. ``We would like to
be able to deal with one bill.''
   The mayor met with House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Rep.
Claude Pepper, D-Fla. Pepper is chairman of the House Rules
Committee, which could order that the two bills be combined.
   Wright and Pepper indicated ``they will consider the request on
merits,'' Koch said.
   The two bills _ one sponsored by Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J.,
the other by Rep. Henry Nowak, D-N.Y. _ both mandate that New York
City and eight other sewage authorities stop dumping sludge in the
Atlantic Ocean by Dec. 31, 1992.
   New York City, which produces 3.8 million wet tons of sludge a
year, has said it cannot meet that deadline and needs until at
least 1998 to find disposal alternatives.
   The other authorities that are dumping sludge 106 miles offshore
are: Nassau and Westchester counties in New York; and in New
Jersey, Middlesex County; Passaic Valley; Joint Meeting of Essex
and Union Counties; Bergen County; Rahway Valley; and
Linden-Roselle.
   Those authorities that fail to meet the deadline would be fined
on a scale that could subject New York City to paying somewhere
between $146 million and $730 million a year, according to Judy
Chesser, the city's Washington representative.
   The city does not like either bill; Koch called the Hughes
version ``savage'' and the Nowak bill ``less savage.'' The key
difference between the two is the Nowak bill would allow the city
to enter a consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency
which could stipulate that the dumping end by a date later than
1992, although the fines would still go into effect, Chesser said.
   ``We would be negotiating a consent decree on a schedule we felt
we could meet,'' she said of the Nowak bill. ``EPA, of course,
would be pushing us to have the most expedited schedule possible.''
   The EPA has stopped negotiating with New York over the city's
compromise offer to stop dumping by 1998, said Herman Phillips, a
regional EPA spokesman in Manhattan.
   ``We're not negotiating any deadline yet because we're waiting
to see what Congress is going to do,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Senate last month passed a similar bill to stop
the dumping of sewage sludge by January 1992. Under that bill, New
York City could end up paying up to $152 million in fines,
according to Chesser.
   City officials arehoping a later deadline will be worked out
when the House and Senate bills move to conference for
reconciliation.

   Hurricane Helene is packing winds of 100 mph far
off in the Atlantic Ocean and heading toward the Americas, but
forecasters say it has a lot to prove before it should be
considered dangerous.
   At midday today, Helene was centered near latitude 13.2 north,
longitude 42.7 west, or about 1,125 miles east of Barbados and
2,500 miles east of Miami, about 100 miles closer than it was six
hours earlier, according to a National Hurricane Center advisory
issued just before noon.
   ``If it makes it all the way over to the west side of the
Atlantic, there's a chance it could become much more significant,
but it also has to go through a lot of wind patterns in the
atmosphere that could mess it up,'' said Randy Lascody, a
meteorologist at the center.
   The Atlantic hurricane season's eighth named storm was moving
west at 10 mph. It was expected to maintain that path for a day or
two, the advisory said.
   ``It's a long, long way from causing any problems,'' Lascody
said.
   A nominal hurricane about 250 miles wide, Helene is the first
hurricane to form since Gilbert, which reached that status rapidly
after it entered the Caribbean. Gilbert last week thrashed Jamaica,
the Cayman Islands, Mexico and the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Weather systems that form this month near the Cape Verde Islands
off Africa's coast, as Helene and Gilbert did, enjoy excellent
hurricane-spawning atmospheric conditions. They are often the
strongest of the six-month Atlantic storm season that begins June 1.
   ``The water's warm, the environment is favorable, conditions are
right for some additional strengthening,'' said forecaster Hal
Gerrish.
   Forecasters couldn't predict if Helene might become as fierce as
Gilbert, described as the century's most intense hurricane in terms
of barometric pressure. The hurricane center expected to send a
reconnaissance plane to check Helene's growth on Saturday when the
storm is closer, Gerrish said. Until then, forecasters will rely on
satellite reports.
   ``This hurricane could do any of a number of things, but
typically in this part of the ocean they don't strengthen too much
until they get closer to the Windward Islands,'' Lascody said.
   Tropical depressions _ winds swirling around a warm core of low
pressure _ are named as storms when top sustained winds hit 39 mph,
and reach hurricane status when top sustained winds hit 74 mph.
   Besides Gilbert, which packed top winds of 175 mph, two small
hurricanes formed this season. Debbie brushed the Mexican coast,
and Florence moved over Louisiana.

   Beach-goers ready to frolic in U.S. coastal
waters should be prepared to encounter contamination from toxic
chemicals, sewage discharge and medical waste, a private
environmental group said today.
   ``Few regions of the country have escaped the effects of coastal
pollution,'' the Washington-based Natural Resources Defense Council
said in a report released today.
   The report, which examined a variety of ocean pollutants,
suggested the trend toward growing coastal contamination can be
reversed over the next decade, but only through strict pollution
control measures and curbs in development along coastal areas.
   ``Each year our factories dump no less than 5 trillion gallons
of wastewater into coastal waters,'' the report said.
   ``We flush another 2.3 trillion gallons of sewage into them. And
every time it rains or snows, massive amounts of poisonous
substances, including gasoline and pesticides, are carried into the
sea as runoff from our city streets and farms.''
   Half of the nation's population lives within 50 miles of coastal
waters, including the Great Lakes system, the report said, noting
that the population in many coastal regions is expected to increase
sharply over the next decade.
   The report cited as examples of the coastal pollution problem:
   _The Environmental Protection Agency's designation of three
locations in Washington's Puget Sound as priority toxic cleanup
sites under the federal Superfund law because of sediment
contamination.
   _The closing of parts of Maine's Casco Bay in recent years to
clam and mussel digging because of bacterial pollution from
inadequately treated sewage that was allowed into the waters.
Sediments in the bay also were found to be contaminated with heavy
metals, PCBs and an assortment of pesticides.
   _Continued high levels of the toxic pesticide DDT in
California's Santa Monica Bay 20 years after it was dumped into the
water by industry. The pesticide was banned in 1972.
   _The forced closing of at least 40 beaches in New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut during the first three weeks of this summer
because of sewage contamination.
   _The oil industry's routine dumping into offshore waters of
thousands of tons of waste material, including ``drilling mud''
that contains toxic chemicals.
   Medical waste on beaches, which attracted widespread attention
last summer, continues to be a problem, the report said. Such
wastes have been reported on beaches in 17 states this summer.
   ``Even supposedly clean beaches are far from safe,'' said the
report, entitled ``Ebb Tide for Pollution.''
   About one-fourth of all sewage wastewater ``is dumped directly
into coastal waters'' and much more is released into rivers that
eventually reaches the ocean, the report said. Pollution from a
variety of sources increasingly is showing up in fish and shellfish
in many parts of the country, it said.
   Even the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contributes to the
problem, the report said.
   Of up to 700 million cubic yards of material dredged by the
Corps from harbors and channels each year, as much as 35 million
cubic yards are highly contaminated from pesticides, heavy metals,
PCBs and oil, according to the study. Much of the dredged material
is dumped in the ocean.
   The environmental group called for tighter controls on toxic
industrial pollutants as well as runoff pollutants from agriculture
and other sources, a ban on all discharges of raw sewage into
waters and more effective treatment programs and tighter land-use
and zoning requirements to curb coastal development.
   It also urged a halt of ocean dumping of medical wastes or the
discharge of plastics from vessels, sewers or other sources, and a
comprehensive program to protect coastal waters from oil spills
including a tightening of restrictions on offshore drilling and
tanker shipments.

<TEXT>
   The Navy said Tuesday it was
apparently responsible for medical debris that washed onto beaches
remote from any metropolitan area, but that military officials did
not know how it happened.
   ``The debris which is washing ashore ... in North Carolina
appears to be connected with the United States Navy,'' said Chief
Petty Officer Joseph Mowery, a spokesman for the Navy's Atlantic
Fleet in Norfolk, Va.
   He said Navy officials had ordered a thorough cleanup and a full
investigation.
   ``Navy regulations regarding the disposal of trash, especially
medical wastes, are very stringent and we do not yet know how this
refuse came to be washed up as it has,'' he said.
   State and local authorities said it was unlikely the debris
posed a public health hazard.
   ``We don't foresee any problems at this time as far as closing
the beaches,'' said John Stevens, police chief of Indian Beach,
where syringes and vials such as those used in blood tests were
found in a trash bag Monday night.
   Gov. Jim Martin said the problem may have been exaggerated
because of recent concerns at some Northeast beaches.
   ``In the past, there have always been occasions of things like
syringes or test tubes washing up onto the beach, but people would
just pick them up and throw them away,'' Martin said. ``But, with
the well-publicized problems of the New Jersey beaches, people are
more alert to potential problems with medical debris.''
   Numerous beaches have been closed for varying periods this
summer along the coasts of New Jersey, New York's Long Island and
New England because of medical waste and sewage.
   A similar problem has cropped up on Lake Erie, with several
hundred syringes, medical-type tubes and plastic containers washing
ashore over the weekend near Cleveland. Ohio environmental crews
wearing plastic gloves combed a private beach Tuesday.
   ``I personally view this as probably one of the most disgusting
and heinous dumpings I've seen of any sort in Ohio and we see
dozens every month, usually hazardous waste,'' said Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency Director Richard L. Shank as he
surveyed the beach cleanup.
   ``This is the only time we had anything of this magnitude of
hospital, possibly infectious, waste,'' said Shank.
   He and Tim Horgan, director of environmental health for Cuyahoga
County, advised swimmers to avoid White City beach, seven miles
from downtown Cleveland.
   Horgan said syringes occasionally wash ashore, possibly insulin
needles that pass through the sewage system into Lake Erie, but the
large number found along the White City beach ``is unreasonable.''
   North Carolina's governor related the problems being faced by
the coasts to the lack of hazardous waste dumps in the country.
   ``If we cannot provide adequate facilities for properly
disposing of hazardous wastes, people are going to dump them in the
ocean,'' Martin said. ``We made a real mistake last year in not
deciding on a hazardous waste site for North Carolina.''
   Dr. Ron Levine, state health director, led a team to Atlantic
Beach on Tuesday to investigate the problem and urged people to
remain calm. A 6-inch glass tube containing a brown substance was
found there Saturday and was shipped to a state public health
laboratory Tuesday.
   Atlantic Beach Police Chief William Duke also played down the
danger of the find there.
   ``It's not medical debris as we know it,'' he said. ``It's mixed
in with waste food products. We do not think it is related to the
New Jersey-New York problem. We think it is related to a passing
vessel.''

<TEXT>
   Diesel fuel from a dredge that sank
in the St. Marys River channel on the Florida-Georgia border is
threatening sensitive marshes and disrupting Navy traffic, federal
officials said Sunday.
   The channel remained closed Sunday, blocking both commercial
traffic from the Port of Fernandina and military traffic from Kings
Bay Naval Submarine Base, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Henry Rohrs in
Jacksonville.
   The dredge, which had been working to deepen the channel to
accommodate the Navy's mammoth Trident nuclear submarines, foundered
and sank in high winds and heavy seas Saturday morning.
   While most of the leaking diesel oil from the 168-foot-long Crest
floated into the Atlantic Ocean, some drifted inside the channel.
Containment booms were erected to protect up-river creeks.
   Seven crew members from the Crest, owned by the Great Lakes
Dredging and Dock Co., were plucked from the water as it sank in the
50-foot deep channel. A barge alongside broke away and drifted
several miles south along Fernandina Beach before it was secured.
   Officials hoped the containment booms would keep the pollution
from the tidal marshes of Cumberland Island, part of the federal
park system.
   ``What's made this one more severe is not so much the oil, ...
but it's spilled in a critically sensitive area,'' said Rohrs. ``And
of course you're blocking a channel. You've got the Navy and
commercial traffic.''
   He said no oil had hit the marshes. Also, no commercial traffic
was scheduled to enter the channel until Monday or Tuesday. A sonar
survey of the channel has been planned to see if ships can navigate
around the dredge.
   Coast Guard Capt. Robert O'Pezio, on-scene coordinator, said the
sunken dredge contained 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel. He estimated
that at a rate of 500 gallons an hour, the fuel would leak for three
days.
   ``The wetlands here are sensitive, we're prepared to physically
protect those wetlands,'' O'Pezio said Saturday.
   He added they are not planning to clean up the fuel drifting in
the Atlantic Ocean because it has not reached beaches.
   The Great Lakes Dredging and Dock Co. will have to pay for
cleaning up the spill, O'Pezio said. Bill Moore, the company's
project superintendent, said he did not know what it would cost.
   To assist in the clean up, the Atlantic Strike Team, a federal
environmental pollution response unit, was dispatched to Fernandina
Beach Saturday. A member of the Florida Department of Environmental
Regulation's hazardous waste response team also was there to monitor
the spill.
   Also alerted was Cindy Mosling, the founder and director of
BEAKS, Bird Emergency and Kare Sanctuary. Ms. Mosling said she was
prepared to help whatever birds may be suffering affects from the
oil spill.
   ``Diesel is very poisonous to birds,'' she said. ``Not only does
it burn their skin, but inhaling it burns their lungs.''

   MIAMI -- Tugboat captain Rex Barnes eases an ocean
freighter up the Miami River, barely missing piers, bridges
and other vessels. "We made it," he says, relieved when the
ship reaches its dock.
   Mr. Barnes wasn't so lucky last December, when the
steering gear of his tugboat failed, sending the M/V Rio
Miami crashing into the Southwest Second Avenue bridge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Miami River is such a narrow, congested waterway that
Mr. Barnes's fellow captains joke that they need Vaseline to
slip freighters through it. And there are those here who
believe it is the most chaotic river in the country. "The
vessel maintenance and operating practices on the Miami River
are akin to what existed in the '50s -- that is, the 1850s,"
says Commander George Michael Williams of the U.S. Coast
Guard in Miami.
   All this transpires within a polluted former drainage
ditch that flows 4.5 miles from near Miami International
Airport to Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, right through
downtown.
   The 150-foot-wide channel is traveled by vessels ranging
from yachts to wooden Haitian freighters departing with
bicycles, refrigerators, empty buckets and so many used
mattresses piled high all over the ships that the river in
places sometimes seems like a kind of giant water bed.
   Its muddy banks are lined with vessels tied to palm trees
or each other, sunken wrecks and freighters seized by Customs
for their part in drug smuggling. All told, it has the look
of a "Third World operation," says Jack Scarborough, a
professor at Barry University here. "It's more like the
Bangkok River than anything in this country."
   Miamians have long turned their backs to the river, but
that may be impossible now after a recent spate of
collisions, groundings and sinkings. In February, the M/V
Conception, which had just chugged out of the Miami River,
was crippled by engine failure and drifted in a storm onto
Miami Beach. There, the rusting hulk -- and its rotting cargo
of beans and rice -- sat for more than a month before state
officials paid to have it dragged back to the Miami River. A
couple of weeks later, a Coast Guard cutter scuttled a Miami
River freighter that had caught fire in the Atlantic Ocean.
   The river has "become a significant problem to the Coast
Guard and the U.S. taxpayer," says Cmdr. Williams. Clearly
angered, he says, "If the people on the river can't or won't
change their operation, the federal government will change it
for them."
   So far, local interests are producing studies, proposals
and hype. One group of terminal operators has hired a river
coordinator, who starts June 1. The Coast Guard is preparing
special regulations for the Miami River, including some
designed to reduce ship capsizings caused by improper loading
-- although it will take another two years for the new
regulations to go through the approval process. Others are
lobbying for highway tunnels to replace drawbridges, such as
the one at Second Avenue that is still undergoing repairs
after its December encounter with the Rio Miami.
   But few have any illusions about the job ahead. "I have
doubts all the time," says Teofilo Babun, chairman of the
Miami River Marine Group, representing terminal operators.
"The problems are gigantic."
   The biggest challenge comes from the Haitian freighters,
which too often are undercapitalized, unseaworthy and
operated by inexperienced seamen. Plagued by financial or
legal problems, they frequently change ownership, registries
and names. A Honduran-flag, Haitian-owned vessel called the
Mrs. Tatiana when it arrived on the river last month has been
renamed the Marinel after it was seized and sold by Customs.
"Other ports might have one or two vessels like these, but we
have a whole fleet," says Coast Guard Lt. Dale Hutchinson.
   It's not only ships' names that change. At a dock
cluttered with mattresses, lumber and piles of plastic
buckets, a 31-year-old Haitian seaman, who first gives his
name as Michael Robinson, later amends it to Willie James.
"We buy cargo from homeless people, thieves, anybody," he
says.
   "Sometimes, I'm ashamed to go down the river this way,"
says Eslie Robinson, the Colombian-born captain of the
Compassion de L'Eternal, its deck stacked with used cars,
trucks, bicycles, mattresses and buckets bound for Haiti,
where impoverished residents are eager takers. "In Colombia,
we have poor people also, but they don't buy these things."
Engine problems have kept the Compassion in port, according
to Mr. Robinson. But Coast Guard officials say they won't let
the ship depart until its owners remove cargo from the engine
room, crews' quarters and the path to the anchor.
   Robert Menge, Dade County's Miami River enforcement
coordinator, patrols the river in an unmarked boat looking
for polluters. And he doesn't have to go far before he sees a
seaman on a small freighter dump a pail of soapy water over
the side. When he confronts the polluter's shipmates, Mr.
Menge gets a strong denial. "What guy? Nobody dumped
anything," one shouts back.
   Mr. Menge is used to being unappreciated. Michel Milfort,
manager of a ship terminal on the river, grouses that "it's
harassment. They are trying to put the screws on everybody."
Nevertheless, Mr. Milfort concedes there is room for
improvement at his terminal. "This place is a piece of junk,"
he says, pointing to the terminal's crumbling riverwall.
   Miami is gradually repairing leaky sewer connections, a
key source of river pollution. (A pump failure caused a big
sewage spill Sunday.) Soon to come are restrictions on
houseboats' dumping of untreated sewage in the river.
Meanwhile, river boosters are lobbying the Army Corps of
Engineers to dredge the river's bottom of polluted sediments.
   Boosters say snook, tarpon, porpoises and manatees are
becoming more plentiful as the river's water begins to
improve. But some things don't change overnight. On a recent
day, a brown pelican swims past a police boat towing a
floating corpse. Police say the victim was a local resident
who got drunk, fell in the river and drowned.
   There are some who believe the Miami River has a bright
future as a tourist attraction complete with riverwalks,
cafes, shops, restaurants and water taxis whisking passengers
between Miami's airport and cruise ship terminal. "It would
be a shining spot for downtown Miami," says Peter Swartz,
whose family owns property on the river. Until then, Mr.
Swartz says part of his land will continue to be a dock for
Haitian freighters such as the Sainte Marie, whose decks are
loaded with mattresses and a few live chickens.
   And there are those like John Scott Smith, a
second-generation tugboat captain, who fears Mr. Swartz's
vision represents a threat to the river's ambiance. "It's a
slimy atmosphere," acknowledges Mr. Smith, who lives aboard
his tugboat on the Miami River. Nevertheless, he says he is
worried that his "inheritance is being taken away from me."
   He adds darkly: "I can envision the day when we have 500
little footbridges where Mom and Dad and the kiddies can walk
out and feed the carp stocked in the Miami River."

<TEXT>
   Republican nominee George Bush showered Michael
Dukakis with scorn in the governor's polluted home port Thursday,
accusing his Democratic rival of ``hiding his secret record'' of
anti-environmental actions.
   On a ferry tour of Boston Harbor, which has become a major
environmental embarassment to Massachusetts, Bush noted that this
was where American revolutionaries dumped tea to protest British
taxes.
   `If tea were spilled in the Boston Harbor today, it would
dissolve in the residue of my opponent's neglect and delay,` Bush
said aboard his chartered ferry, which was followed by a handful of
boats carrying chanting Dukakis supporters.
   Bush exclaimed ``fantastic'' when he was shown a copy of the
Boston Herald reporting the results of a new poll under a banner
headline reading: ``Shocker: Bush Ties Mike in Mass.'' The vice
president said he couldn't believe it.
   During the day, Bush harshly accused Dukakis of trying to avoid
ridding the harbor of sludge and sewage. The state is now beginning
its cleanup program under a federal court order.
   Bush said voters should know that ``the reason the Boston Harbor
is not cleaner today is that the Dukakis administration twice
sought to avoid making it cleaner.'' He said half a billion gallons
of ``barely treated sewage'' enter the harbor every day.
   The Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Boston releases
500 million gallons of sewage every day.
   ``My opponent's solution: delay, fight, anything but clean up.
Well, I don't call that leadership, and I certainly don't call that
competence,'' Bush said, invoking Dukakis' frequent argument that
competence is what voters want in the 1988 election.
   Bush said that in 1978 and in 1984, Dukakis as governor sought a
waiver of a federal Clean Water Act provision requiring secondary
treatment by all publicly owned treatment facilities.
   While Dukakis prepared the waiver request in 1978, it was his
successor, Gov. Edward J. King, who made the first request in 1979.
   Douglas Foy, an attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation
which sued Dukakis as governor in 1983 to clean up the harbor, said
it was the Environmental Protection Agency that took no action on
the waiver request for three years.
   Bush brushed aside a question about an EPA delay under the
Reagan administration of which he was part. He said he was focusing
on what he would do as president and on Dukakis' record.
   `The stealth candidate is at it again. Making promises on one
hand but hiding his secret record on the other,` Bush said.
   He said Dukakis had visited the waste-strewn beaches of New
Jersey and promised to end pollution there. ``What he didn't tell
them is this,'' Bush said. ``The Dukakis adminsitration had applied
in 1985 for a permit to dump Massachusetts sewage sludge off the
coast of New Jersey.''
   Massachusets asked the EPA in 1985 for temporary permission to
dump at a site 106 miles offshore where New York and New Jersey
already were dumping. A compromise arrangement allowed
Massachusetts to dump further out, beyond the continental shelf.
   Bush, pressing his effort to attract environment-minded voters,
campaigned later Thursday at the Maritime Center in Norwalk, Conn.,
where people are concerned about pollution of Long Island Sound.
   ``When it comes to preserving and protecting the environment,''
Bush told an audience at the center, ``I do consider myself a Teddy
Roosevelt Republican. We are not going to give away this
constituency to the Democrats.''
   Standing on the deck of the ferry boat as it passed Deer Island,
the future site of a sewage treatment plant near the mouth of Boson
Harbor, the vice president urged a ban on ocean dumping of sewage
sludge after 1991.
   He also called for more intensive Coast Guard efforts, with the
help of the FBI, to apprehend violators.
   Bobbing in the wake of Bush's ferry were several boats carrying
protesters waving pro-Dukakis campaign signs.
   One motorized raft carried a banner that read, ``Bush Loves
Toxic H2O.'' A sailboat had one reading ``Bush Loves Noriega,'' a
reference to Panama's military leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega, who has
been implicated in drug trafficking.
   On a larger boat, about 20 Dukakis suppoters chanted ``Where was
George?'' the Democrats' favorite rallying cry since their
nominating convention in Atlanta in July.
   Bush laughed and waved at the demonstrators, and called them
``pathetic.''
   ``Out of respect for my office, there ought to be more than
that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Comet May Have Triggered Ancient Wave Which Smashed Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 66-million-year-old rock deposit in a Texas
creek bed shows that the area was once smashed by a massive ocean
wave, perhaps triggered by a large comet or asteroid that hit the
Atlantic Ocean, according to a study published today in the journal
Science.
   Thor A. Hansen, a geologist at Western Washington University,
said he and another researcher found evidence that a wave, perhaps
as tall as 300 feet, scoured the floor of a primitive Gulf of
Mexico, picked up sand and shark teeth, then dumped the material in
what now is in a bed of a tributary to the Brazos River in Central
Texas.
   ``It (the wave) was so big, we think the circumstantial evidence
is very strong that it was caused by a bolide (meteorite) impact,''
said Hansen.
   The deposit, he said, was found in what is called the
Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. This is the name given a geologic
formation that other researchers have identified as having been
created during a time that meteorites were showering Earth, about
66 million years ago.
   Hansen said the formation he found in the Texas creek bed is
rich in iridium, an element that is common in meteorites but rare
on Earth. It is considered a universal mark of the
Cretaceous-Tertiary (called K-T) boundary.
   At the time that the wave was created, Hansen said Texas and the
whole Gulf coast area looked far different than now. The waters of
the ocean were much higher and the coast was much farther inland.
   Hansen said the massive wave churned against the ocean floor,
moving huge clay boulders, picking up sand, limestone and shark
teeth, and leaving a path of great erosion.
   When the waters settled down, the debris was deposited again on
the ocean floor, leaving a mark of the violence that occurred. Over
many centuries, the sea water receded, dry land emerged and now the
deposit left by the wave is seen in the wall of a creek bed in
Falls County in Central Texas.
   ``The thing that is remarkable about this deposit is that it was
produced far offshore on a quiet water shelf,'' said Hansen.
``Above and below is just mud, quiet water sedimentation. There's
no evidence of any disturbance at all. Yet, in the middle of that,
there is this quite large unit.''
   Based on the force required to move the material left in the
deposit, Hansen said he calculated that the wave had to be 150 to
300 feet high.
   Circumstantial evidence, he said, leads to the theory that a
meteorite striking the ocean caused the wave because there is no
geologic evidence suggesting that a volcano or an earthquake could
have triggered the wave.
   ``There was no volcanic activity nearby at the time,'' he said.
``Also, we find no volcanic ash in the formation.''
   The only other thing that could have created such a large wave
of this type, said Hansen, is a meteorite about six miles in
diameter that probably struck the west central Atlantic Ocean.
   Other researchers, he said, have found K-T formations in
Arkansas, Haiti, Mexico and offshore from North Carolina. All of
these, said Hansen, help support the idea that a boulder from space
swamped Texas with a splash some 66 million years ago.
   Co-investigators with Hansen in the study were Joanne Bourgeois
and Patricia Wiberg of the University of Washington, Seattle, and
E. G. Kauffman of the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colo.

Advancement of Science.

UBIQUITOUS PLASTIC FOULS SEA, TAKES TOLL OF WILDLIFE

The oceans are choking in plastic junk that kills marine life and forms a crust 
on once pristine coastlines, according to a researcher who has combed the sea 
for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial abuse heaped on the oceans became vivid in reports about the 
devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound and the 
mysterious algae tides fouling beaches in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
But less well known is that tons of long-lasting plastic debris has accumulated 
for years on the high seas, washing ashore on beaches thousands of miles away 
from where it was dumped. 
</P>
<P>
Like dirty rings on a bathtub, bits of plastic coat beaches from the central 
Gulf Coast to Cape Cod and across the Atlantic on the western shore of England. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found hockey pucks on beaches in the Bahamas," oceanographer Jude Wilber 
said in an interview. "Mediterranean coasts are very plasticized." 
</P>
<P>
Far out in the Atlantic on a 135-foot schooner, run as an educational program 
for college students, Wilber found that plastic pollution is ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone from what we assume was a plastic-free ocean in 1960 to our present 
state," Wilber said. "Over large parts of the ocean well removed from any shore 
it's virtually impossible to tow a sample without getting some plastic. 
</P>
<P>
"Roughly 30% of the Atlantic contains high concentrations of plastic," he said. 
"In those areas, it is impossible to tow a net without getting something. You 
can find roughly 10,000 pieces per square kilometer," which is less than half a 
square mile. 
</P>
<P>
On dozens of voyages with student crews throughout the North Atlantic, Wilber 
has taken more than 1,000 samples by dragging a fine mesh bushel-sized net for 
a mile at a time. 
</P>
<P>
He winds up his research this fall with a final cruise to the Caribbean from 
the Woods Hole, Mass., base of the maritime program offered to college students 
by the Sea Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic pollution kills fish, sea birds, turtles, seals and whales, and can 
damage coral in the tropics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sea birds, including albatross and various species that never go ashore, are 
found stuffed with plastic beads or strangled by fishing line. 
</P>
<P>
Giant sea turtles have become an endangered species, partly because so many 
suffocate after ingesting plastic bags mistaken for jellyfish, a favored food. 
Whales and seals are similarly threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Coral is whisked away by snagged line whipped like a scythe by the waves. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the plastic junk escapes through fishermen's nets, but the beads of 
polyethylene ingested by fish and lobster is certainly undesirable from a 
consumer standpoint, said Robert Bryant, an expert on New England's lobster 
industry at the University of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic beads, the building blocks of all types of plastic goods, are 
manufactured in several nations and then transported by ship to be melted down 
and molded elsewhere. Spillage is relatively common. 
</P>
<P>
Wilber's research, since he first publicized his discoveries two years ago, has 
focused on the path of the debris. He has found that floating plastic 
circulates on ocean currents that reveal the Atlantic to be a gigantic 
whirlpool, centered in Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
"People make the assumption that pollution is close to shore, and it's just not 
true," he says. "The highest concentrations are in the middle of the ocean, 
much higher than it is adjacent to any coast." 
</P>
<P>
Plastic is long-lived and most of it does not degrade either in landfills or in 
the ocean, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's subtle, with none of the dramatic, instantaneous effects such as you 
get with an oil spill or toxic waste dumping," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One disgusting result appears on the rocky coasts of Caribbean islands, Wilber 
said. A crust as much as half-a-foot thick, made up of tar from oil spills 
embedded with bits of plastic, extends over the entire windward shore of some 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
"The tar acts a lot like plastic in that it floats around the ocean for years. 
Coagulated clumps of oil get caught in our nets, too, and ends up on the same 
shores and beaches," Wilber said.

<HEAD>Some New Jersey Businesses Aren't Complaining About Ocean
Pollution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Beach closings in recent weeks have
hurt many boardwalk businesses, hotels and restaurants, but some
business owners aren't complaining.
   Joe Santora, owner of Custom Pools in Belmar, said he ``took
advantage of a sad thing'' by placing advertisements saying,
``Polluted waters taste bad. Our pools are drinkable as well as
affordable.''
   ``I've found that some people are disgusted with the ocean and
beaches,'' Santora said. ``For those people who like swimming and
are fed up with the ocean's pollution, they're interested in
pools.''
   All the state's beaches were open Wednesday following the
reopening Tuesday of three beaches at Asbury Park and beaches at
the Gateway National Recreation Area at Sandy Hook. But the impact
of periodic beach closings over the last three weeks because of
high bacteria counts and medical waste extend beyond the main
affected areas in Monmouth County in central New Jersey. Beaches
also have been closed periodically in New York state and north in
New England.
   At Swimland in Jackson Township, general manager Sam Dadas said
he's had several customers buy pools because of the beach pollution.
   ``But mostly they're buying pools just because they want to stay
at home,'' he said. ``People are now more home-oriented. They don't
want to drag their kids to the beach anymore.''
   Some people are taking more drastic measures and leaving the
state altogether.
   ``I've had a few people mention that they weren't going to stay
here because the beaches are really disgusting,'' said Donna
Rubolino, manager of Uniglobe Express Travel in Toms River.
``They're afraid of stepping on something. A lot of people are
going to the Caribbean, where the water is blue and clean.''
   Those who stay close to home are flocking to state and county
parks.
   Ocean County Park lifeguards have estimated daily crowds are up
30 percent. Cheesequake State Park in Old Bridge Township has
reached capacity on most weekends so far this summer, something
that usually happens only on holidays.
   Frank Guidotti, assistant director of the state Division of
Parks &amp; Forestry, said good weather certainly has helped park
attendance, but he added that many people might prefer swimming in
lakes and reservoirs rather than ocean beaches.
   Some casinos in Atlantic City are reporting a busier summer than
normal, but they were hesitant to cite beach pollution as a reason.
   ``Most people that come to Atlantic City are gamers,'' said
Maryann LoBianco, a spokeswoman at Tropicana Hotel and Casino. ``A
beach closing or beach pollution won't necessarily cause people to
come to Atlantic City instead.''
   Meanwhile, Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye said witnesses
will be brought before a grand jury to look into possible criminal
wrongdoing in the operation of the old Asbury Park sewage plant,
which contributed to high bacteria counts that forced beaches in
four communities to close last week. A new sewage plant opened
Saturday to replace the old plant.

<HEAD>Bush Continues Fiery Attack On Dukakis Over Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELMAR, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush kept up his attack on
Democrat Michael Dukakis' environmental record, accusing the
Massachusetts governor of seeking to pollute the waters of New
Jersey where sewage has closed beaches.
   In fiery remarks, Bush stood on a sunny New Jersey beach and
told supporters he has one question for his Democratic opponent:
   ``Why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of New Jersey
when your own state applied to pollute it?''
   Displaying the feisty campaign style he has recently adopted,
Bush shouted with disdain as he referred to a 1985 application from
Dukakis' as governor of Massachusetts to dump his state's waste in
an ocean dump site 106 miles off New Jersey.
   ``For almost two years, he fought to allow Boston's sludge to be
dumped off New Jersey's shore _ the very shore on which he had the
nerve to stand and promise clean water. Nice guy _ yeah,'' Bush
said sarcastically.
   He told the beach-clad crowd of supporters that if Dukakis comes
to their shores on another campaign trip, ``Be sure to ask him,
'Why did you want to dump Boston sludge off our coast in New
Jersey?'''
   A compromise allowed Massachusetts to dump further out beyond
the continental shelf.
   Bush was heckled by Dukakis supporters who chanted ``Where was
George?'' and carried signs ridiculing the Reagan adminisration's
Environmental Protection Agency as being weak.
   But the few hundred Bush supporters who had tickets to enter the
roped off beach section where he spoke, drowned out the protesters
with chants of ``We want George.''
   At one point a plane flew over pulling a banner with the words,
``Where was Teddy Kennedy?'' It was the Massachusetts senator one
who made the ``Where was George?'' line a Democratic rallying cry
in his speech at the party's convention this summer.
   Bush laughed when he saw the plane, saying, ``Where did that guy
come from?''
   Then he said, ``So I was home with Barbara. What's wrong with
that?''
   The remark appeared to be an oblique version to a quip making
the rounds of Republican circles that Bush was home, dry and in bed
with his wife, a pointed reference to the time Kennedy drove his
car off a bridge at Chappaquidick after a party and a young woman
passenger drowned.
   Bush told the crowd that ``nobody fools nature over the long
run.'' He said he would fight ``to ban ocean dumping forever,'' and
would ``make the enforcement of Superfund, the prosecution of
polluters, and the cleanup of toxic waste a top priority.''
   Bush was introduced by New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, and later
was met on a Delaware stop by Gov. Michael Castle and former Gov.
Pete du Pont, who sought the GOP presidential nomination earlier
this year.
   Bush wen to historical New Castle, Del., for another
environmental speech and a crabbling demonstration.
   In an interview with a group of outdoor reporters and editors
Bush, who has been saying, ``I am an environmentalist'' at every
campaign stop in recent days, said he was also a sportsman who has
fished and hunted for years.
   ``Anybody who loves these outdoor sports as much as I do has to
be concerned with clean water,'' he said.
   Bush avoided reporters' questions about Dukakis' decision to
re-hire John Sasso, a former campaign manager who quit last year
because he distributed a videotape that helped drive Delaware Sen.
Joseph Biden out of the Democratic presidential race.
   ``I haven't thought about it,'' Bush said at one point.
   But later, while bobbing around in boats in the Delaware River
for a crabbing demonstration, reporters shouted questions about
Sasso across the water.
   The vice president at first shook his head and then held up one
of the crabs in the boat, saying, ``Speaking of crabs.''

OLD NUCLEAR DUMP OFF COAST IS A RELIC OF ERA OF NAIVETE IN TOXIC DISPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the black depths of the ocean near the Channel Islands lies a largely 
forgotten memento of the early nuclear age. It is low-level radioactive waste 
generated at Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory and Canoga 
Park plants. 
</P>
<P>
For about a decade starting in the early 1950s, Atomics International, later 
part of Rockwell, dumped hundreds of drums of radioactive waste in 6,000 feet 
of water south of Santa Cruz Island. 
</P>
<P>
Today, precise information on the dump is hard to come by. Old U.S. government 
reports estimate that the dump received about 3,100 drums of waste containing 
108 curies of radioactivity -- apparently not a great concentration considering 
the diluting power of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not known if these numbers are accurate, or if all the dumping was 
recorded. Neither is it certain whether other government contractors disposed 
of waste at the site. Except for a limited survey in 1960, there has been no 
environmental monitoring of the Santa Cruz site by Rockwell or government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Specific Studies 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, there have been no specific studies directed at that 
particular site to find out exactly what has been dumped there," said Diane 
Green, a park naturalist with Channel Islands National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The Park Service . . . does have concerns for that site as well as any other 
toxic dumping site," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Larger radioactive dumps used during the same years have been studied, 
specifically those near the Farallon Islands off San Francisco and in the 
Atlantic Ocean. Although elevated radioactivity was found in bottom sediment 
near these dumps, no significant levels were found in samples of fish. Most 
researchers have concluded that too little radioactive material was dumped off 
the U.S. coasts during the '40s, '50s and '60s to create a human health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The dumping was more of a dangerous precedent than a life-threatening event, 
said W. Jackson Davis, professor of biology at UC Santa Cruz and a leading 
critic of ocean disposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Waste 
</P>
<P>
However, the dump may also be a special case because radioactive waste was not 
the only thing disposed of near Santa Cruz, the largest island in Channel 
Islands National Park. When Atomics International began the dumping, the Navy 
was already using the site to dispose of military waste. In fact, official 
nautical charts describe the site as a former "chemical munitions dumping area" 
-- saying nothing about radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
The radioactive waste dumping, authorized by the old U.S. Atomic Energy 
Commission, was variously estimated by Rockwell officials to have stopped 
between 1959 and 1962, when commercial land burial sites became available for 
low-level wastes generated at the Canoga Park plants and the Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"The ocean is awfully big," and ocean dumping was considered "a perfectly 
acceptable way to dispose of radioactive waste," said Marlin Remley, former 
chief of nuclear safety and licensing at Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, 
successor to Atomics International. "I don't know when it was decided that, 
'Hey, this is no good.' " 
</P>
<P>
Atomics International dumped low-level material, including liquids, 
contaminated wipes, gloves, glassware and other equipment. But the refuse 
included some highly dangerous plutonium, according to a paper delivered by 
company officials at an AEC symposium in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Atomics International began the ocean dumping before moving to its plant at 
6633 Canoga Ave. at the end of 1955. Previously it disposed of waste from 
experiments at its plant in Downey, where the firm operated California's first 
nuclear power reactor, a tiny test model, starting in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Although radioactive dumping by the United States virtually ended in 1962, it 
surfaced as a major environmental issue years later, leading to congressional 
hearings in 1976 and later. 
</P>
<P>
According to information compiled at the time, at least 27 Pacific, Atlantic 
and Gulf Coast sites were designated for low-level wastes, but the waste dumped 
near the Farallons and at three Atlantic Coast sites far exceeded the volume at 
all other sites combined. Virtually all environmental monitoring by the 
Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations has been done at these 
larger sites. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have found measurable radioactivity at each of the sites, but "we 
didn't find any significant uptake of radioactive materials in any of the fish 
we sampled," said Bob Dyer, chief of environmental studies for the EPA office 
of radiation programs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Chain 
</P>
<P>
Similar conclusions have been reached by contract researchers for the 
California Department of Health Services, who have gathered fish samples near 
the Farallon Islands during the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the key thing you want to know," Dyer said. "You want to know whether 
it's going up the food chain and getting into man, and there's no evidence of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Dyer said that in 1960, an AEC contract research firm did a limited survey of 
the Santa Cruz dump and found no significant contamination. 
</P>
<P>
According to the paper delivered by Atomics International at the AEC symposium, 
wastes were put in cylindrical ice cream cartons, which were placed in 
55-gallon drums and sealed with concrete to make sure that they would sink to 
the bottom. About four times a year, the waste drums would be trucked to Long 
Beach for loading on a Navy barge. 
</P>
<P>
The price could not be beat. "No costs are involved since the dumping ground 
trip by the U.S. Navy is regularly scheduled for other purposes and ample space 
is available" on the Navy barge, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid Overtime 
</P>
<P>
But Atomics International paid overtime to its maintenance workers, several of 
whom accompanied each voyage. They would ride in the tug until it arrived at 
the dump, then take a small boat back to the barge to roll the drums over the 
side. The trip to the dump and back could take more than 24 hours, and the men 
were paid for every hour at sea. 
</P>
<P>
James Youngblood of Santa Clarita, a retired Rockwell worker who went on two of 
the dumping trips, said this was a plum assignment and the men took turns 
because of the extra pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they enticed the maintenance workers, the blue-collar workers, with 
the overtime pay," said Eula Youngblood, his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"We just took it for granted it was a safe thing to do," said Junius Wheeler of 
Lake View Terrace, a former maintenance supervisor who helped prepare the drums 
for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
The volumes dumped may have increased after nuclear work shifted from Downey to 
Canoga Park sites and the Santa Susana lab, which have done extensive work with 
test reactors and nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm's Records 
</P>
<P>
Company memos, provided by Rockwell in response to questions about the ocean 
disposal, allude to at least 10 dumping trips in 1958-59, including the 
disposal in September, 1958, of 225 55-gallon drums along with contaminated 
boxes, tanks and conduits. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the company hired commercial haulers, but a problem arose with the 
private firms. Just as the operation involved old ideas of pollution control, 
so did it run afoul of throwback racial attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
During the overnight trips, private tug crews were reluctant to share their 
bunks with the Atomics International maintenance men, some of whom were black, 
according to George Borg, a former health physicist with the company. Borg said 
a tugboat captain told him, "The guys on board don't want to give up their 
bunks to anybody who's colored." As a result, he said, Atomics International 
resumed trips with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Another bad experience involved a private contractor hired to dispose of 
contaminated dirt around Santa Susana's experimental sodium reactor following a 
1959 accident that melted part of its nuclear fuel, Borg said. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor, Coastwise Marine Disposal Co. of Long Beach, accumulated more 
than 1,000 drums of radioactive waste from various generators without dumping 
it. Eventually the firm, which was cited by the AEC for excessive radioactivity 
at its Long Beach plant, dumped the wastes, including those from Atomics 
International, at another Pacific dump site about 215 miles west of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burbank Firm 
</P>
<P>
This second dump site was used by another San Fernando Valley firm, Isotopes 
Specialties Co. of Burbank, in 1961, according to a report by the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, successor to the AEC. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of follow-up monitoring of the Santa Cruz dump is not necessarily a 
problem, said Don Womeldorf, chief of environmental management for the state 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose the logical answer is that if we look in the areas where the 
greatest amount of dumping took place and find nothing of potential public 
health significance there, then one would conclude that the likelihood is much 
less of having problems where less material was deposited," Womeldorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dyer also said he is not concerned about the Santa Cruz dump, he 
added: "If it hasn't been monitored since 1960, it would probably be useful to 
assure ourselves that there's no significant inventory of radioactive materials 
present in the site. . . . If the public wanted assurances, then it would be a 
good idea."

<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to approach the Commonwealth of Independent States for permission
to send a research vessel to the Kara Sea, south of the Arctic Ocean, where
radioactive waste was dumped by the former Soviet Union.
An initial request, in 1989, to monitor radioactivity in the nearby Barents
Sea was turned down by the Soviet authorities.
Officials at the Ministry of Agriculture responsible for radiation
monitoring around the UK coastline are drawing up details of the approach to
the CIS.
British officials want to study the movement of radioactivity from the dump
area. Scientists believe contamination may be spreading.
Radioactivity has been detected in the sea around Greenland and the
Sellafield nuclear reprocessing works of British Nuclear Fuels has come
under suspicion. British scientists believe Sellafield is unlikely to be the
source.
Regular monitoring of an area of the Atlantic Ocean formerly used by Britain
to dump radioactive waste has failed to detect any leakage.
Dumping in the area, 400 miles from the coast, was suspended in 1982, after
a campaign by environmentalists. The ocean there is more than half a mile
deep.

   A tropical depression in the Caribbean fizzled and
was downgraded today to a tropical wave, while two other
depressions brewed in the Atlantic as peak hurricane season
approaches.
   ``We were expecting this one to have really picked up steam by
now, but that just hasn't materialized,'' forecaster Bob Case said
of the tropical wave about 300 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica.
   The system, which at its strongest had winds of nearly 30 mph,
was still producing widespread showers and thunderstorms over the
Caribbean. The system will continue to be watched, but regeneration
is unlikely, the National Hurricane Center reported.
   Meanwhile, the newest tropical depression formed Monday in the
middle Atlantic Ocean, east of the Lesser Antilles. The
westward-moving system's highest sustained winds were near 35 mph
around a loose center roughly 100 miles east of the island of
Dominica, forecasters said in a noon EDT advisory today. The
depression was moving westward at 20 mph and was not expected to
change in course or strength though today.
   A third depression was located about 350 miles northwest of the
northernmost Cape Verde Islands, off west Africa. It was moving
west-northwest at 15 mph into colder water, a course and speed it
was expected to maintain for the next day or two. Its highest
sustained winds were estimated near 35 mph.
   Depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when their
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74
mph.
   There have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988 Atlantic
Ocean hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane strength.
   Case noted earlier that three depressions at the same time is
normal at this point in the Atlantic hurricane season, which began
June 1 and ends Nov. 30.
   ``We're really approaching the peak of the season,'' he said.

   A moderate earthquake
hit Portugal's Azores islands today, causing panic and minor
injuries, officials said.
   The quake shook the islands of Pico and Graciosa in the
nine-island archipelago's central group, said Victor Hugo of the
Azores University vulcanology department. The islands are about 740
miles west of mainland Portugal in the Atlantic Ocean.
   The temblor's epicenter was to the north of Graciosa island, Hugo
said.
   The quake measured five to six on the Mercalli scale, which
gauges the intensity of a quake as felt in a specific location on a
scale of one for the weakest quake to 12 for the strongest.
   Island hospital officials were quoted by the Portuguese news
agency Lusa as saying there were minor injuries.
   An employee at Santa Cruz medical center, Graciosa, said a house
collapsed but the center had admitted no casualties.
   According to civil protection services, slight material damage
was registered but islanders panicked and rushed into streets.
   Vulcanology experts have been observing Furnas volcano that has
been murmuring since Saturday on the largest island of Sao Miguel,
Hugo said.
   The Azores lie close to the North Atlantic Ridge, a seismically
active line stretching north-south in the Atlantic Ocean where two
crustal plates are pulling apart.
   A major earthquake hit the Azores in January 1980, killing at
least 49 people and injuring more than 300 on the islands of Sao
Jorge and Terceira.

<TEXT>
   A tropical depression churned over
the Dominican Republic Thursday after dumping heavy rains on Puerto
Rico, where it killed three people and left 485 homeless.
   The depression, with maximum winds of 35 mph, struck land in the
Dominican Republic after passing 150 miles south of Puerto Rico,
according to the National Weather Service in San Juan.
   A 6 p.m. EDT advisory from the National Hurricane Center in
Miami said the depression was centered over the Dominican Republic
about 75 miles north of Port-au-Prince, capital of neighboring
Haiti. It said the weather system was headed west-northwest at 15
mph and expected to move along the northern coast of Cuba for the
next 12 to 24 hours.
   The system was not expected to grow much stronger unless its
center moved well north of Cuba, forecasters said.
   The depression dropped 6.6 inches of rain on Puerto Rico in 24
hours before moving westward to nearby Dominican Republic,
forecasters said Thursday.
   Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in Puerto Rico in two
separate incidents Wednesday night when trees crushed their cars as
they were driving along rural roads, police said.
   State Secretary Sila Calderon declared a state of emergency, and
National Guard units mobilized to rescue families trapped by
swollen rivers. In Mayaguez, on the western side of Puerto Rico,
Civil Defense authorities ordered hundreds of residents in
low-lying areas to abandon their homes.
   More than 100 homes around the island were seriously damaged by
flooding, including two that were destroyed, according to Civil
Defense officials. They also reported 67 flooded areas, 33
mudslides, 18 overflowed rivers, eight damaged highways and three
damaged bridges.
   Nora Perez Ruiz, 22, fled to an emergency shelter with her two
brothers and mother from her home near Mayaguez.
   She said she had worried about flooding since the last major
floods hit the area in 1975. ``I've been nervous and occasionally
haven't been able to sleep thinking about when a flood would
come,'' she said Thursday.
   The state of emergency was lifted Thursday, and public schools
reopened after a daylong closure. But 485 people in 10 towns were
still being sheltered in schools, housing projects and a sports
center, Civil Defense authorities said.
   The depression was expected to trigger rainfalls of 5-10 inches
in the Dominican Republican, where flash flood warnings were in
effect.
   Mark Zimmer, a forecaster for the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, said the depression would weaken as it passed over
Hispaniola, the island shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
   However, he said it could intensify into a tropical storm when
it moves back out to sea. He said that would probably happen Friday.
   ``Right now, it's too early to say whether it's going to become
a hurricane,'' Zimmer added.
   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their maximum
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when maxium
sustained winds hit 74 mph.
   Two tropical storms have developed so far in the Atlantic Ocean
during this year's hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane
strength. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
   Meanwhile, a second depression that formed near the Cape Verde
Islands off West Africa died Thursday in the distant Atlantic Ocean
about 1,550 miles from Bermuda, forecasters said.

SANITATION DISTRICTS WON'T ALTER OCEAN DUMPING PRACTICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The Sanitation Districts of Orange County voted Wednesday night to continue 
dumping about 260 million gallons of partially treated sewage into waters off 
Huntington Beach annually rather than spend $1.4 billion on added treatment 
facilities to cut the amount of solid waste pumped offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Despite testimony of representatives from environmental groups that such 
continued dumping threatens the public health, the 37-member board voted 
overwhelmingly to apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for a 
second five-year waiver from water quality standards in the federal Clean Water 
Act. Six members of the board voted not to seek a waiver and to add to 
treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The districts' board of directors, which represents 80% of northern Orange 
County, decided that the impact of ocean dumping of sewage treated to less than 
full secondary standards as required has been minimal and that the alternative 
would be too costly, amounting to increased sewer fees of $25 per household 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
Board Vice Chairman A.B. (Buck) Catlin, before casting his vote at the hearing 
in the Fountain Valley Community Center, said there is no evidence that the 
marine environment offshore has been harmed by current dumping practices. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the sanitation districts pursue stringent restrictions, we will not 
damage the environment to any deeper extent," Catlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Catlin said full secondary treatment of sewage requires more landfill space for 
an increased amount of sludge. 
</P>
<P>
Those who favor improved sewage treatment facilities, such as environmental 
groups concerned about marine life, say the increasing amount of sewage -- an 
estimated 400 million gallons a day by the year 2020 -- would put a strain on 
the environment. They contend that improved treatment would ensure that the 
impact on marine life and beaches never gets worse than it is today. 
</P>
<P>
If current dumping practices continue, "cockroaches will be the best animal to 
survive in the new environment," said Margaret Johnson of Huntington Beach and 
a member of the American Cetacean Society, which seeks to protect marine 
mammals. "The ocean out there is not one big tidy bowl. We want the ocean 
clean." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the sanitation districts' board who expressed the most support for 
adding additional facilities represented Orange County's beach communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot take a chance on the environment," said board member and Huntington 
Beach City Councilman Tom Mays. "The ocean began life, and it can also end it." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over sewage treatment has gone on since 1972, when Congress passed 
the Clean Water Act, setting a standard that all of the country's waterways 
should be fishable and swimmable. 
</P>
<P>
The law required treatment plants to process sewage twice to remove at least 
85% of the solids before dumping the effluent into water. The act was amended 
in 1977 after coastal cities complained that they were being held to standards 
intended for lakes and rivers even though oceans have a greater capacity to 
absorb sewage. 
</P>
<P>
The amended bill allowed the EPA to grant waivers to coastal areas that could 
prove that they were meeting clean water standards without full secondary 
treatment of their sewage. The county sanitation districts received a five-year 
waiver in 1985. It expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiver Plans Dropped 
</P>
<P>
Two southern Orange County sanitation districts several years ago dropped plans 
to seek waivers in the face of opposition from local environmentalists. Now, 
the cities of Los Angeles and San Diego have opted to spend billions to upgrade 
sewage treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Orange County sanitation agency, which has facilities in 
Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach, provides primary treatment -- sewage 
processed once -- to all its sewage, and secondary treatment to half. Under 
primary treatment, 75% of the solids are taken out, sanitation district 
officials said. Under secondary treatment, 85% of the solids would be removed. 
</P>
<P>
According to a sanitation agency report on the issue, 18 acres of the ocean 
bottom would be affected by the county's sewage outfall without secondary 
treatment. With full secondary treatment, only five acres would be less pure 
than surrounding waters. 
</P>
<P>
The county's sewage goes through a massive pipe that lies beneath Brookhurst 
Street in Huntington Beach, continuing underneath Pacific Coast Highway and out 
along the ocean bottom for about five miles. 
</P>
<P>
There, 200 feet below the surface, it dumps almost all of Orange County's 
partially treated sewage. The sewage outfall has been operating for almost 18 
years. No evidence of damaged marine life has been reported. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decision, most county residents will pay more in future sewage 
fees, as county facilities will have to be expanded to accommodate the 
increased flow of sewage expected by 2020.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Strugovets: ``Is the Ocean the First To </F>
Perish?''] 
  [Text] The first dumping of radioactive waste (RAO) 
in the seas was performed by the USA in 1946 in the northeast 
part of the Pacific Ocean, at a distance of 80 kilometers from 
the coast of California. Since that time, the World Ocean has 
become truly a storehouse of spent nuclear raw material... 
  Great Britain has dumped three-fourths of all the 
world's RAO into the ocean, performing 34 burials of solid 
radioactive fuel in 15 sites in the North Atlantic, The Minch, 
the Bay of Biscay and in the region of the Canary Islands in the 
period from 1949 through 1982. The mass of dumped containers 
comprises 74,052 tonnes, with an overall activity of 949 kCi 
[kilocurie]. 
  The disposal of liquid RAO from atomic industry enterprises 
by means of dumping through pipelines into the Irish Sea was 
also widely practiced in England. And this too was a 
considerable amount. From 1974 through 1982 the waste products 
dumped annually exceeded an overall activity of 100 kCi. The 
total scope of the dumping was so great that its effects were 
seen as far as the Barents and Karsk Seas. 
  The Netherlands, in the period from 1967 through 
1982, had 14 cases of RAO dumping at four sites in the North 
Atlantic at a depth of 3,200 - 5,200 meters, with a mass of 
19,162 tonnes and overall activity of 9.1 kCi. 
  France has had two cases of dumping RAO into the 
Atlantic Ocean. The mass of dumped waste comprised 14,299 
tonnes, with activity of 9.54 kCi. In 1979, waste from nuclear 
enterprises was dumped into The Minch. 
  Switzerland has dumped RAO 12 times in the period 
from 1969 through 1982 at three sites in the North Atlantic. The 
mass of the materials dumped comprised 5,321 tonnes, and their 
overall activity was 119 kCi. 
  The USA, in the period from 1949 through 1967, has 
dumped 34,282 containers of RAO with overall activity of 79.4 
kCi at 11 sites in the Atlantic. In the period from 1946 through 
1970 it dumped 560,261 containers with overall activity of 15 
kCi at 18 sites in the Pacific Ocean. 
  Moreover, during the period of operation of the nuclear 
fleet, the U.S. naval forces have lost two nuclear 
submarines--the ``Thresher'' (April of 1969) and the 
``Scorpion'' (May of 1968). Together with the first nuclear 
submarine alone, there turned out to be around 270 kCi in 
fission products at the bottom of the ocean. Plus the loss of a 
number of nuclear weapons. 
  Japan performed dumping of RAO into the Pacific 
Ocean near its shores in 1956-1969. It performed 12 disposal 
operations at six sites, dumping 3,301 containers with overall 
activity of 0.416 kCi. 
  Belgium has dumped RAO 15 times, in The Minch and 
the Bay of Biscay, disposing of 55,324 containers with overall 
activity of 57.24 kCi. 
  This list is rounded out by Germany, Korea, Italy, New 
Zeleand and Sweden, through whose efforts the overall activity 
of RAO dumped into the World Ocean has been brought up to 1,240 
kCi. This, we will emphasize, is without taking into 
consideration the waste from plants processing nuclear fuel, 
lost nuclear weapons and other sources of ionizing radiation, 
sunken nuclear submarines and radionuclides which have found 
their way into the ocean as a result of underwater nuclear 
explosions. However, a number of specialists maintain that the 
real number is somewhat higher. Yet the main mass of radioactive 
waste--over 98 percent--is buried in the Atlantic Ocean. 
  We will note that in recent years, as a result of the sharp 
criticism of this practice, all the states have reduced or 
discontinued altogether their dumping of RAO into the seas. Yet 
in spite of this, they have reserved the right to dump 
radioactive waste in the World Ocean. In Great Britain and 
France the possibility of step-by-step dumping of RAO into the 
sea has been officially granted--by the Convention on Protection 
of the Marine Environment in the Northeast Atlantic--until the 
year 2018. 
  And what about Russia? Or more precisely, the USSR, since it 
is specifically from it that we have inherited the problems of 
dumping radioactive waste in the seas. 
  And so, the first dumping of RAO in the USSR was performed 
in 
1959 and was associated with the testing of nuclear submarines 
and the nuclear ice-breaker ``Lenin.'' In September of that 
year, 600 cubic meters of waste with overall activity of 20 mKci 
were dumped into the White Sea. In 1960, 100 cubic meters of 
liquid RAO with overall activity of 200 mCi were dumped from the 
nuclear ice-breaker ``Lenin'' near Gotland Island (Gulf of 
Finland). That year marked the beginning of the practice of 
regular dumping of liquid radioactive waste, and 1964 marked the 
start of dumping of solid RAO into the northern and far eastern 
seas. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-006-49A>           Graphic </FIG>




  Let us begin with the North. According to the report by the 
governmental commission on questions concerning the dumping of 
radioactive waste at sea, in the northern region of the USSR, 
and now in Russia, there are four regions for dumping liquid 
radioactive waste and disposal of solid radioactive waste. These 
are located generally north of the 72nd parallel and west of 
Novaya Zemlya. These regions were selected by the staff 
headquarters of the Northern Fleet in 1960-1966 and approved by 
the Naval Fleet Main Staff Headquarters. Up until 1986, the 
Murmansk Steamship Line also performed such dumping of RAO in 
the regions designated for the Northern Fleet. 
  The dumping was extremely non-uniform, and the maximal 
values 
of activity were noted in 1965 (northeastern part of the Barents 
Sea, around 1,000 Ci), in 1975 (central part of the Barents 
Sea--800 Ci and Karsk Sea--8,500 Ci), in 1988 (northeastern part 
of Barents Sea, around 5,300 Ci), and in 1989 (as a result of 
the accident of the nuclear submarine at Ara-guba, 2,000 Ci). 
  In a breakdown by seas, the level of overall activity is 
distributed as follows: Baltic--0.2 Ci, White--100 Ci, 
Barents--12,153 Ci, Karsk--8,500 Ci. On the whole, it is 24 kCi. 
  Is this a lot? 
  For comparison we may cite the following fact: Studies 
performed by a scientific expedition in 1985-1986 showed that 
the underwater current of the Gulf Stream in that year alone 
from the North Atlantic--the site of constant dumping of RAO by 
Great Britain and France--has brought us radioactive waste with 
overall activity of around 24 kCi. As much as we dumped in the 
northern seas over a period of 30 (!) years. 
  The Far Eastern region. Since 1966, the USSR performed 
dumping of RAO in the Far Eastern seas in 10 regions. The 
greatest amount of radioactive waste (by volume) was dumped near 
the southeastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula. And the 
greatest amount by overall radioactivity was dumped into the Sea 
of Japan. The maximal amount of dumping in terms of 
radioactivity occurred in 1975 and 1985-1987. The overall 
radioactivity of the RAO comprised 18,565 Ci. 
  In the opinion of specialists, considering the huge water 
area in the Far Eastern region, the RAO dumped by the Pacific 
Fleet comprises no more than a few percent in the balance of 
anthropogenic radioactive pollution, and therefore cannot cause 
an ecological catastrophe. This is true in full measure also of 
the Fall (1993) dumping of RAO by the ships of the Pacific 
Fleet. ``The dumping in the Sea of Japan in October,'' 
emphasized the head of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Ecological Safety 
Main Administration, Viktor Kutsenko, in a speech presented at a 
recently held ``roundtable'' on problems of dumping RAO in the 
seas, ``posed no danger to the environment. And subsequent 
dumping, which will be practiced in this region until the end of 
next year, will also not pose a hazard. We may even not consider 
this waste as being radioactive.'' 
  Nevertheless, according to Kutsenko himself, an ecological 
threat really does hang over the Far East. But the reason for 
it, as it turns out, is not the radioactive waste which has been 
dumped into the sea, but that which is being stored in special 
tankers of the Pacific Fleet. This problem is confirmed also by 
specialists at the VMF Glavkomat [Naval High Command]. In the 
opinion of one of them, Captain 1st rank Yevgeniy Romanov, the 
TNT-5 and TNT-27 industrial tankers loaded with liquid 
radioactive waste are in such a poor technical state that they 
may sink at any time. Then the huge concentration--several 
hundred cubic meters--of radioactive waste would really cause a 
catastrophe. In order to avoid this, the decision was adopted to 
begin dumping in the water basin of the Sea of Japan. The 
dumping, I repeat, is caused by technical necessity. And even if 
under the pressure of the world community we will have to 
discontinue such actions in neutral waters, the specialists at 
the VMF Glavkomat will insist on at least one-time dumping 
within the limits of Russian territorial waters. 
  Of course, the dumping of radioactive waste in the World 
Ocean cannot continue for long. Yet today, practically in the 
entire world, the technology of processing radioactive waste 
lags behind the demands. Here in Russia, one other problem is 
added to this. Despite the fact that we possess sufficient 
scientific and technical potential to create the necessary 
conditions for processing liquid RAO into solid and for its 
subsequent disposal, we cannot take serious steps forward due to 
the shortage of finances. And a significant amount of these will 
be required. According to preliminary estimates, around 10 
billion rubles (R) would be needed to solve the problem of 
radioactive waste in the Pacific Fleet. In the Northern 
Fleet--approximately half that amount would be needed. For a 
full resolution of the problem in the country--several hundred 
billion rubles would be needed, and with application of Western 
technologies--several hundred million dollars. 
  However, it is erroneous to think that this problem is 
Russia's alone. The World Ocean is the cradle of life on the 
planet, and all countries which consider themselves civilized 
must apply their efforts to keep from destroying it.

   An artificial reef made up of 23
concrete structures is being dropped into the Atlantic Ocean this
week, and engineers predict it could be an answer to beach erosion.
   The $200,000 cost of the project will be borne by millionaire
Willis du Pont, who will have four sections of the reef submerged
off the coast of his Palm Beach property.
   The structure, designed by engineer Hans Rauch, has been tested
by engineers at Florida Atlantic University and the University of
Florida. Many past experiments with other reefs have failed,
engineers said.
   Windy conditions in Riviera Beach Monday delayed loading of a
barge that was to carry parts of the reef to the site off Palm
Beach.
   Du Pont, an heir to the Delaware chemical fortune, agreed to pay
for the experimental reef, and its installation, after learning
that his beachfront property is washing into the sea.
   Stretching parallel to the beach, the concrete structures will
be sunk 175 feet off the coast, about 3 feet under the surface of
the water.
   Each structure is 25 feet long, 12 feet wide and 5 feet high,
and is designed to break a wave before it reaches the shoreline,
thus reducing or stopping the drift of sand from the beach.
   Once in the water, the reef will be tested by University of
Florida researchers, who also will be checking to see if marine
life grows on the reef.

<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels said Wednesday they
have not abandoned their fight for the besieged eastern city of
Jalalabad, but are reorganizing for assaults on other
communist-held cities in Afghanistan.
   The Moslem guerrillas and Western diplomats reported fresh
fighting in the war-torn country, including the destruction by
guerrillas of a northern ammunition dump laden with Soviet weapons.
   A seven-party guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan issued a
statement Wednesday describing reports they had given up the fight
for Jalalabad as ``baseless.''
   An Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman told Western reporters in
Kabul, the capital, Tuesday that guerrillas had given up on
Jalalabad and turned their attention on Khost, about 84 miles to
the south.
   Rebels confirmed the fighting at Khost and said a recent lull in
fighting at Jalalabad probably was due to a visit there by
guerrilla leader Yunis Khalis.
   Khalis, elderly head of the hardline Hezb-i-Islami rebel group,
is reportedly meeting with field commanders to map out new tactics
to break a nearly three-month old stalemate at Jalalabad.
   Communist government forces finally launched a counterattack
late last week but guerrillas pushed them back, using some of their
own captured tanks, according to combined reports.
   The rebels, backed primarily by Pakistan and the United States,
have vowed to fight on until the collapse of Kabul's ruling
Marxists and the establishment of an Islamic republic of
Afghanistan.
   The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power in a
bloody 1978 military coup, sparking the Moslem insurgency. Soviet
forces intervened in December 1979 to prop up the government but
finally withdrew in February under a U.N.-brokered acord.
   With a harsh winter behind them, the rebels say they are
preparing major assaults on Kabul and the southeastern city of
Kandahar.
   One rebel commander, Mohammad Nasir, said about 30,000 rebels
were organizing to attack the heavily fortified capital as early as
this weekend.
   However, a rival commander said he thought Nasir was boasting.
   ``We are making careful plans for Kabul to avoid the same
mistakes as Jalalabad,'' said Abdul Haq of the Khalis faction,
reputed to be the most powerful of rebel commanders in the Kabul
area.
   He was referring to criticism that rebels attacked Jalalabad
before they were sufficiently armed and organized.
   ``We're working on detailed plans as to how and when. ... But
I'm not going to print my plans in the newspapers,'' Haq said on a
visit to Peshawar, Pakistan.
   Rebel sources said some rebel commanders are holding out for
negotiations with government troops in order to avoid civilian
bloodshed.
   Rebel reorts Wednesday said guerrillas blew up a major
ammunition dumpat Mazar-i-Sharif, capital of northern Balkh
province some 36 miles from the Soviet border, around May 7.
   Masood Khalili, a spokesman of the Jamiat-i-Islami rebel group,
said the blast killed 360 communist soldiers and wounded 100. He
said at least 175 Soviet-built tanks and armored personnel carriers
were destroyed in two days of fires and secondary explosions.
   Unconfirmed reports said the communists plan to shift their
capital to Mazar-i-Sharif if Kabul falls to the rebels.
   In another development, a Soviet official in London charged
Wednesday that the United States and Pakistan have failed to honor
the accord on Afghanistan by continuing to provide military and
moral support to the guerrillas.
   ``Pakistan and the United States, when they were signing the
Geneva accords, it se They can't tell
authorities wh options to utilize,'' said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr.,
as a House rine and fisheries subcommittee 
presentations on a range of technologies used he subcommittee, in its second
day of reports on compliance
with the Ocean Dumping Act of 1988, examined ways that nine New
York and New Jersey sludge dumpers could dispose of their wastes
and meet the Dec. 31, 1991, deadline to cease sludge dumping.
   Sally Lentz, staff attorney for the non-profit Oceanic Society,
said a lawsuit filed by six New Jersey communities against EPA to
challenge stiff fines being imposed for an inability to stop
dumping by 1991 has set back the process and could jeopardize the
public's input into local compliance plans.
   Ms. Lentz also cautioned the committee that it is virtually
impossible to quantify environmental damage from sludge dumped at a
designated site 106 miles off the New Jersey shore, and, on that
basis, said she was disappointed in the way the EPA has discounted
potential health effects linked to sludge.
   New Jersey Democratic Rep. William J. Hughes said Garden State
communities trying to implement dumping alternatives could benefit
from an information clearinghouse. However, he was quick to praise
the EPA's overall performance in encouraging compliance from the
dumpers.
   ``I recognize it's often popular to jump on the Environmental
Protection Agency. My constituents want us to stop dumping
yesterday,'' Hughes said.
   ``Region II (of the EPA) is making an impressive and enormous
effort,'' said Lynne Edgerton, a coastal protection attorney with
the Natural Resources Defense Council. However, she warned that
communities' commitment to a single solution, such as incineration,
``excludes any opportunity to re-use this material.''
   L. Jack Davis, a former EPA regional administrator in Atlanta
and Dallas who now serves as president of Dallas-based Oxidyne
Corp., acknowledged the need to provide guidance to communities
seeking to dispose of their sludge.
   ``EPA has a very undirected research program,'' said Davis,
whose company injects the sludge and organic waste into a mile-deep
well, where it is treated and converted into carbon dioxide, ash
and water that requires further purification.
   David Greenhut, director of marketing and new product
development for Kubota America Corp., said Kubota transforms sludge
into a chemically stable, glass-like material ``which in turn is
used in the production of ceramic tiles, cinder blocks, ground
cover, drainage fill, and in asphaltic and cement mixes.''
   The Kubota end-product contains the metals found in sewage
sludge, but in an inert form, he said. Japan has approved the final
product as a substitute for landfill sand, improving agent for poor
drainage land, anti-water penetrant agent for tennis courts and
playgrounds, pavement material for light-load roads and bedding for
pipes.
   Ernest A. Kollitides, president and chief operating officer of
Dehydro-Tech Corp., of East Hanover, N.J., said his firm has been
using its patented Carver-Greenfield Process to evaporate the
liquid from sludge using a light oil. With that process, which is
being installed at sludge plants in Mercer and Ocean counties in
New Jersey, the resulting dry solids can be used as fertilizer or
as fuel to produce steam and electricity.
   The left-over water is clean and requires only minimal
treatment, he said, and the oil-soluble compounds in the sludge are
removed, such as pesticides, herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls,
dioxins and cleaning fluids.
   Kollitides said Mercer County Improvement Authority communities
in New Jersey will feed raw sludge to their Carver-Greenfield
facility, which will produce fertilizer and burn sewage oil from
the sludge to produce steam to power the process.

   A Navy helicopter crashed into
the Atlantic Ocean just off the beach Monday, killing all four
people aboard, the Navy said.
   Their bodies were recovered Monday evening by divers who located
the fuselage of the SH-2 Sea Sprite helicopter, said Jim Kaufmann,
a spokesman at the Jacksonville Naval Air Station.
   The crash occurred about 200 to 300 yards offshore roughly two
miles south of Ponte Vedra Beach, situated a few miles south of
Jacksonville in northeast Florida.
   The downed helicopter was one of three en route from the
Atlantic Underwater Test and Evaluation Center on Andros Island in
the Bahamas to its home base at Willow Grove, Pa., said Veronica
Schauer, a Navy spokeswoman at Jacksonville Naval Air Station.
   ``We have recovered some wreckage,'' she said.
   The names of the missing crewmen were not immediately released.
The cause of the crash was under investigation.
   The helicopter was attached to Helicopter Anti-Submarine
Squadron Light 94, a reserve squadron, she said.
   One witness said he saw something fall from the helicopter
before the accident.
   ``We were watching the helicopter come up the coast when
something fell off,'' said Ronnie Ruffner. ``It came from the
front. I couldn't tell if it was someone diving out or not.''
   Duke Dubose saw the helicopter spiral and then plummet sideways
into the ocean.
   ``It looked like the back rotor quit, and it started to
tailspin,'' he said.

   Fourteen Greenpeace members opposed to ocean
dumping staged an acrobatic protest during Wednesday evening's rush
hour, swinging on ropes beneath the Triborough Bridge as they
unfurled a huge banner.
   NEW YORK (AP) _ Fourteen Greenpeace members swung on ropes
beneath the Triborough Bridge on Wednesday to protest ocean
dumping, and tied up traffic on the span and on the East River
below, authorities said.
   The demonstrators took to the bridge at 5:45 p.m., dangling
above the East River with their banner reading ``Stop Ocean Dumping
Now,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Andrew Davis.
   They hoped to block barges carrying sludge for ocean dumping, he
said. But Tina Casey, spokeswoman for the Department of
Environmental Conservation, said no barges were scheduled to depart
during the protest.
   ``So far, it hasn't affected us at all,'' she said.
   The protest forced officials to shut down two westbound lanes of
the bridge, which links Manhattan and the Bronx with Queens, while
eastbound traffic was at a near standstill due to rubber-necking,
authorities said.
   After more than five hours, the protesters remained suspended
about 100 feet above the water, forcing the Coast Guard to stop all
traffic on the waterway from passing under the bridge, said Coast
Guard spokesman Joe Gibson.
   ``Basically, we're waiting it out,'' said Gibson. ``There's not
too much we can do.''
   It was the second Greenpeace action in as many days aimed
against the Wards Island Sewage Station.
   Davis said the swinging protesters planned to lower themselves
and deny access to any sewage barges leaving the station, which is
on the East River island.
   On Tuesday, five members of the worldwide ecological group were
arrested after they chained a dinghy to the rear of a sewage barge,
with a protester chained to a mooring line for the dinghy, police
said.
   That protest delayed the departure of the barge for three hours,
authorities said. The barge, one of four operated by the city, was
heading to an ocean dumping site 106 miles from New York Harbor.

   Gov. Bob Martinez has endorsed plans to
protect the Florida Keys by creating a marine preserve that would
be paid for in part by $5 fees on snorkling and diving.
   The plan, approved by Martinez and the Cabinet on Tuesday, still
needs the Legislature's OK.
   The Keys are a string of islands extending from Florida's tip,
from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. Environmentalists
say the area's coral reefs and sea grass beds are being destroyed
by boats and overdevelopment.
   The proposal approved Tuesday calls for boundaries that would
extend from the islands out three miles into the Atlantic Ocean and
10 miles into the Gulf.
   Martinez and the Cabinet rejected one part of the plan that
would have instituted a 50-cent highway toll and $1 flight fee to
help pay for the preserve. Left intact was a $5 fee on snorkling
and diving.
   Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner said the money shouldn't
come from tourists simply because they travel to the area.
   ``In my judgment they should pay when they dive, or when they
launch (boats),'' he said.
   The proposal would also place sensitive areas of the Keys
off-limits to boaters and slap controls on treasure hunting,
tropical fish collecting and spearfishing.

   Elizabeth Shatto and Christina Drury braved
rough seas to rescue a young girl from drowning in the Gulf of
Mexico last summer, earning them an award from the Carnegie Hero
Fund Commission.
   Now the two 16-year-olds from Houston are taking a lifesaving
course.
   ``We hadn't had any lifesaving before that,'' Miss Shatto said
Thursday. ``It was just instinct. You see someone who needs help
and you go get them.''
   Sixteen other people in 10 states were awarded Carnegie Medals
Thursday by the Pittsburgh-based commission, established in 1904 by
industrialist Andrew Carnegie to recognize what he called the
``heroes of civilization.''
   Of the 18 heroes, five died in their rescue attempts, according
to the commission. Each of the heroes or their survivors received a
$2,500 grant and a bronze medal.
   Miss Shatto said she and Miss Drury were in a beach house near
Surfside, Texas, on Aug. 18, 1987, when they heard a young boy
scream. He pointed to 11-year-old Lynette Bennett, whose head could
be seen bobbing out in the ocean.
   ``There was no one else around. If we hadn't been there, she
would be dead,'' she said.
   The girls swam out, grasped an arm and towed the exhausted girl
to shore, fighting a strong current and rough surf. Lynette
recovered after being hospitalized overnight. Miss Shatto said she
and her friend were uninjured.
   Others honored Thursday are:
   _Robert Ray Dodd, 35, of Clarksburg, W.Va., who died helping to
save his 15-year-old son from drowning in 4{ feet of oil in a
storage tank near his home on July 5, 1987.
   _John D. Anderson, 46, of Baldwin, Mich., who died in an
unsuccessful attempt to save a 16-year-old boy from drowning in
Lake Michigan on July 17, 1987.
   _Carlton M. Muse Jr., 34, of New Bern, N.C., who died trying to
