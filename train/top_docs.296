HOUSE, DEFYING VETO THREATS, OKS WAGE BILL

The House, defying threats of a presidential veto, voted Thursday to raise the 
federal minimum wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by late 1991, 30 cents higher 
than President Bush has said he would accept. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders said that the vote, 248 to 171, is likely to spur the 
Senate into approving an even higher minimum wage -- possibly $4.65 an hour, as 
Senate Democrats have proposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backs 'Training' Pay 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the vote is substantially short of the two-thirds' majority that 
would be needed to override a veto. And the House bill would allow a subminimum 
"training" wage -- 85% of the prevailing minimum wage -- only for a worker's 
first two months on a job, less than the six months sought by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"The President's position is firm . . . " Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said 
Thursday. "We're hanging tough." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor and Human 
Resources Committee and the chief sponsor of the Senate bill, held out the 
possibility that the Democrats might be open to further bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
He urged Bush to "refrain from further veto threats until he sees the shape of 
the bill that Congress finally sends him. This is an excellent opportunity for 
Congress and the Administration to demonstrate that they can work together." 
</P>
<P>
The $4.55-an-hour figure voted by the House was billed as a bipartisan 
compromise. The House Education and Labor Committee originally had sought $4.65 
but agreed to a 10-cent reduction to halt defections by conservative Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The House rejected, 218 to 198, the Administration's $4.25-an-hour proposal. 
Before finally approving the bill, House members voted, 240 to 179, to approve 
the $4.55 figure. 
</P>
<P>
On final passage, 226 Democrats and 22 Republicans voted for the measure, while 
147 Republicans and 24 Democrats opposed it. The California delegation 
essentially split along party lines, with two exceptions: Rep. Charles Pashayan 
Jr. (R-Fresno) voted for the compromise bill, and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles) did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over how much to increase the federal minimum wage is mainly a 
political one. Economists say that the economic impact of a higher minimum wage 
is likely to be modest because labor is already in such short supply that few 
jobs are still paying the federal minimum. 
</P>
<P>
And in some states -- such as California, where the minimum is $4.25 -- state 
law already provides for a higher wage than federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the issue has become a major rallying point for Democrats and 
organized labor. The federal minimum wage has not been increased since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), urging House approval of the 
compromise proposal, told lawmakers that "it isn't enough, but it certainly is 
better than nothing. I'm asking you for this vote today . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Bush has insisted on including a so-called "training" wage for new workers on 
grounds that employers might cut back on hiring if they are forced to pay a 
higher minimum wage to inexperienced workers. He wants the training wage to be 
today's $3.35-an-hour minimum. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing only a 60-day training period, the House-passed bill 
would apply the training minimum only to new workers with no experience. 
</P>
<P>
The full minimum wage would rise to $3.85 an hour on Oct. 1, $4.25 a year later 
and $4.55 in October of 1991 -- a year before Bush's proposed $4.25 would go 
into effect. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise measure would also increase the number of businesses that are 
exempt from having to pay the federal minimum wage. Currently, employers whose 
gross earnings are less than $362,000 a year are exempt. The bill would raise 
the figure to $500,000.

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Increases Sunday for First Time Since 1981</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's minimum wage increases for the
first time in nearly a decade Sunday, but it won't lift millions of
low-wage workers above the poverty level.
   The minimum wage, paid to about 3 million Americans, increases
from $3.35 an hour to $3.80 and will go to $4.25 an hour next April
1. The new law also establishes a subminimum training wage for
certain teen-age workers.
   Critics say the increase should have been greater.
   ``Right now, it's not at a level where people can pull
themselves out of poverty,'' said Jo Ann Mort of the Amalgamated
Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
   ``When people hear minimum wage, they think children working
after school, and that's not the reality of it. The reality is that
adults are trying to support families on this,'' Mort said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., last week called the size of
the increase a ``disgrace'' and said he would push Congress next
year to bring the wage to ``a level that is fair to millions of
workers who are being unfairly exploited now.''
   Kennedy blamed the size of the increase on the Bush
administration, which vetoed a proposal last year to raise the wage
to $4.55 an hour.
   The increase was ``the best we could do against an anti-worker
administration that refuses to do justice for America's working
poor,'' said Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee.
   The administration considers the increase an equitable boost
that will result in fewer jobs being lost than under the $4.55
proposal, White House spokesman Stephen Hart said.
   Polls have shown a majority of Americans support a minimum wage
of at least $5 an hour.
   The minimum wage was established in 1938 as part of the first
Fair Labor Standards Act. During its first 40 years, Congress acted
six times to keep the rate at about 50 percent of the average
hourly earnings of all non-supervisory employees.
   The $3.35 rate, which equaled 48 percent of the national average
earnings in 1981, fell to an all-time low of 35 percent of the
nation's average earnings last year, according to the AFL-CIO.
   After Sunday's increase, full-time minimum-wage workers will
still be $516 a year short of what the government figures it takes
to support a family of two at the poverty level and $4,796 below
the basic needs level for a family of four. The government placed
the poverty level for a family of four at $12,700 in February.
   Still, the boost in the minimum wage may help millions of other
low-paid workers. For instance, companies paying $4 or $4.50 an
hour may decide to raise wages 45 cents to keep trained workers.
   There are more than 11 million Americans making less than $4.50
an hour and nearly 15 million making under $5 an hour, according to
the Labor Department.
   Under the new law, workers ages 16 to 19 may be paid a
subminimum training wage for their first three months in the work
force and for an additional 90 days if the employer has a formal
training program.
   The training wage will be $3.35 an hour when the minimum wage
rises to $3.80 an hour and $3.62 an hour when the minimum wage
reaches $4.25 next April. Migrant seasonal farmworkers are exempt
from the subminimum and the entire subminimum provision expires in
April 1993.
   The wage that employers are required to pay workers who receive
tips will increase to 45 percent of the minimum wage, providing
that tips bring workers' hourly pay to at least the minimum. The
percentage, which was 40 percent before Sunday, goes to 50 percent
a year from now.
   The level at which small businesses are exempt from the federal
minimum wage increases from $362,500 in gross sales to $500,000.
   Hundreds of special exemptions exist, such as for some farm
workers, including tobacco leaf harvesters, casual babysitters,
newspaper delivery workers, amusement park employees, wreath
makers, employees at small radio stations in cities with fewer than
25,000 residents and mollusk and crustacean harvesters.

<TEXT>
   Congress soon will consider an increase in the federal minimum wage to $5.05 from $3.35 an hour. 
Supporters of the increase argue that a major impetus has been recent boosts in many state minimum-wage levels. 
Last year alone, nine states and the District of Columbia raised their minimum wage above the current federal level, and this year New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are considering doing the same. 
Yet, state and federal minimum-wage comparisons should be made with a great deal of caution. 

   There are many loopholes in federal minimum-wage coverage. 
Certain occupations, including casual babysitters and most farm workers, are excluded as well as employees of small businesses and firms not engaged in interstate commerce. 
State minimum-wage laws are intended to cover these workers. 
At the same time, if a state's minimum is higher than the federal minimum, the state minimum applies. 

   Moreover, the quoted minimum wage for a state is often deceptive. 
Some states offer what is, in reality, a menu of minimum wages rather than a single minimum. 
The District of Columbia, whose minimum of $4.85 is the highest in the country, actually has seven other "minimum wages," all of which are lower than $4.85. 
Workers in the retail trade and laundry industry, for example, receive a minimum of only $3.50. 
Furthermore, the District of Columbia, like many states, has a subminimum, or "training" wage, of $3.35 for employees in some job categories who are under age 18. (Some states also have subminimums based on age, student status, approved internship programs or for new hires.) 
Moreover, 13 states have minimums below the federal level and nine have no minimum at all. 

   Another frequently overlooked point is that although 16 states have enacted minimum-wage levels above the current federal minimum of $3.35, not one has a minimum at or above $5.05. 
A minimum wage of $5.05 would require even the high-minimum-wage states of California and Connecticut to increase their mandated minimums by 19%. 

   Nonetheless, both Republican and Democrat members of Congress from high-wage states will likely find it difficult to vote against raising the federal minimum wage, since raising it would equalize wage costs among states and increase the competitiveness of labor in high-minimum-wage states. 
Yet the different minimum-wage levels to a large extent reflect regional variations in levels of unemployment and labor demand, as well as costs of living. 
Typically, states with high minimum wages have low levels of unemployment and/or high costs of living. 
California and Massachusetts, with unemployment rates of 5.6% and 3.8% are representative of states with high minimum wages. 
Compare these unemployment rates to those of Alabama and Louisiana, states that have no minimum wage. 
Their unemployment rates are 7.9% and 12% respectively. 

   The advantage of allowing state or regional differences in minimum-wage levels is that the appropriate minimum wage for Connecticut might force massive layoffs in Texas. 
Wyoming's minimum of $1.60 would be meaningless, even laughable, in Massachusetts, where most employers must pay well above the federal minimum wage to attract applicants for job openings. 
Because states are the best judges of local conditions, they are in a better position to set minimum-wage laws. 

   Proponents of a federal increase argue that recent state increases signal grassroots support of the current minimum-wage bill before Congress. 
Yet 41 states are still at or below the current federal level. 
As Robert Martin of the Chamber of Commerce has pointed out: "Most states recognize that what you pay someone is determined by supply and demand." 
This is a lesson the folks in Washington could bear learning.

<HEAD>Kennedy Supports Increasing Minimum Wage To $5.05 Per Hour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of
the Senate Labor and Resources Committee, expressed his support
Friday for increasing the minimum wage to $5.05 per hour over four
years but said he still remains committed to raises tied to
inflation.
   ``I continue to support indexing,'' said Kennedy, in a statement
released by his Washington office. ``It's the best way to make the
minimum wage a living wage.''
   Kennedy said his committee has scheduled action on the minimum
wage bill during the week of April 11.
   The House Education and Labor Committee voted Thursday to raise
the federal minimum wage to $5.05 an hour in several steps over the
next four years.
   The vote to increase the minimum wage to $5.05, instead of the
$4.65 voted last week by the House labor standards subcommittee,
was seen as an attempt by supporters of an increase to gain a
bargaining chip that will assure the minimum wage will be at least
$4.65 when the measure leaves the House.
   Last week, the subcommittee approved a bill to raise the
$3.35-an-hour minimum wage to $3.85 in 1989, $4.25 in 1990 and
$4.65 in 1991. At the same time, the subcommittee voted to strip
the bill of a controversial proposal that would have indexed or
tied future increases to the rate of inflation.
   ``A fourth year increase is less satisfactory, but it could make
a stronger package, given the president's veto threats,'' said
Kennedy. ``The last time Congress raised the minimum wage in 1977,
we enacted a four-step increase, too.''

SENATE PANEL, DEFYING VETO THREAT, BACKS HIKE IN MINIMUM WAGE TO $4.65 BY 1991

Defying President Bush's veto threat, the Senate Labor Committee voted 11 to 5 
Wednesday for a bill that would raise the $3.35 hourly minimum wage to $4.65 in 
three steps by 1991 without any subminimum rate. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's swift approval, with similar action expected in the House, 
could set the stage this month or early in April for the first legislative 
showdown between the new President and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has proposed a three-stage increase in the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour, 
with an eventual top rate of 90 cents an hour less for new workers in their 
first six months of employment, and he has said he will veto any more generous 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'His Last Offer' 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater reaffirmed Wednesday that 
the President would not yield. "He's giving them our best and last figure up 
front, and his proposal for an increase to $4.25 an hour is fair and firm and 
his last offer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said that the minimum wage has been 
unchanged since 1981 and he believes there is enough congressional support for 
an increase to override a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
"It's on a fast track now," said Kennedy, chairman of the Senate panel and 
chief advocate of the legislation. "The earlier the better, so far as I am 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate may vote as early as next week, he said. The House Education and 
Labor Committee is expected to approve a similar bill next week and seek 
passage by the entire House before the Easter recess starts on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
The federal minimum wage, first enacted a half century ago at the rate of 25 
cents an hour, has been a major battleground for liberals and conservatives in 
almost every decade since. Although former President Ronald Reagan successfully 
opposed any increase in his two terms, Bush announced during his campaign that 
he would favor an increase in the minimum rate but only if it was accompanied 
by a "training wage" for new workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejects Bush Plan 
</P>
<P>
Before approving Kennedy's bill, the Senate Labor Committee rejected Bush's 
plan in a 10-6 vote, mainly along party lines. Two Republicans, Dave 
Durenberger of Minnesota and James M. Jeffords of Vermont, then joined nine 
Democrats in sending the $4.65 legislation to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, led by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), argued that a higher minimum 
wage would destroy 650,000 jobs and contribute to inflation. Their arguments 
were echoed by a business coalition formed to fight any increase in the $3.35 
hourly rate. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition director Bob Martin of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the 
committee-approved bill was "misguided and would have very serious economic 
consequences. We're saying it will set off a Kennedy round of inflation." 
</P>
<P>
But, after the committee vote, Kennedy said the case was "compelling" for an 
increase to $4.65 an hour to restore the 1981 buying power of workers on the 
economic ladder's bottom rung. 
</P>
<P>
As for the President's proposal to pay new workers a lower rate for six months, 
Kennedy said the Labor Department estimated that minimum-wage workers could be 
trained in one month. He said he would listen to proposals for a compromise on 
the amount and duration of a lower wage rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Substandard Wage' 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) said Bush's proposal to pay those workers 
80% of the minimum wage rate prevailing for most workers was "just a 
substandard wage for fast-food operators and others like that." 
</P>
<P>
But Hatch termed it a "classic compromise" between those in the Administration 
who oppose any increase and those who want to raise the federal minimum rate on 
equity grounds. The lower rate, Hatch said, would reduce the loss of jobs that 
otherwise might accompany a $4.25 wage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dashed by Filibuster 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's efforts to get Senate approval of a $4.55 hourly minimum wage last 
year were dashed by a GOP-led filibuster at the session's close, despite Bush's 
general support for an unspecified increase. The House never took up similar 
legislation in Congress' last session, partly because Democratic leaders 
decided that they lacked the votes to pass it. 
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy said that proponents were in a stronger position this year, adding: 
"This case is so compelling -- it's a minimum standard of decency. This 
President (Bush) even recommended a 50% increase in pay for members of 
Congress."

   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy unveiled a scaled-down
proposal Wednesday to increase the federal minimum wage $1.20 to
$4.55 an hour over the next three years.
   The labor-supported proposal from the Massachusetts Democrat
came as the Senate Labor Committee began deliberations on Kennedy's
earlier minimum wage bill. Republican Sens. Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina and Dan Quayle of Indiana immediately expressed their
opposition.
   Kennedy's original bill would have boosted the minimum wage, now
at $3.35 per hour, by 50 cents next year, 40 cents in 1990 and 40
cents in 1991, with automatic increases tied to inflation to keep
it at 50 percent of the average wage nationally.
   The House Labor Committee already has completed action on a
measure that would raise the federal minimum wage to $5.05 an hour
over the next four years. It is understood, however, that the House
panel's chairman, Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., will offer
the Kennedy proposal as a substitute when the measure gets to the
House floor sometime after the July 4 recess.
   In its brief meeting Wednesday, the Senate Labor Committee
rejected 12-4 an amendment by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who wanted
Puerto Rico to be required to keep the federal minimum wage.
   Kennedy's proposal includes Puerto Rico, but permits the country
to exempt itself if the island's minimum wage board certifies to
the labor secretary that there is a ``substantial finding of
unemployment.''
   In introducing his substitute bill, Kennedy said the current
minimum wage has fallen to its lowest point since its inception 50
years ago, with today's minimum of $3.35 per hour representing only
36 percent of the average hourly earnings.
   Historically, he said, the minimum has been maintained at a
figure of one-half the hourly average.
   ``Congressional action to restore the minimum wage is long
overdue,'' he said.
   Thurmond said, however, said he was opposed to a significant
increase in the minimum wage because ``it is inflationary, it
reduces entry-level and part-time jobs for teen-agers and unskilled
workers, as well as decreases services to consumers.''
   He said only ``big labor'' would benefit from an increased
minimum wage.
   ``Minimum wage legislation has always been promoted by labor
unions and other special interest groups for their purely
self-serving political considerations,'' Thurmond said. ``The labor
unions in our country are looking to this measure as a means of
securing their positions and turning around a decline in membership
that they have experienced in recent years.''
   Quayle said he would propose an amendment which would increase
the minimum wage to $4 and combine it with a reform of the earned
income tax credit, similar to an approach presented in the House
Labor Committee by Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wis., but rejected by the
panel.

   Congressional Democrats are poised to act on
compromise legislation to increase the federal minimum wage of
$3.35 per hour by $1.20 over the next three years.
   The task will not be easy, though, if Republicans are able to
anything about it.
   The Senate Labor Committee voted 11-5 Wednesday to approve
legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $4.55 per hour by
1991.
   But floor action on the bill is not expected until after the
Democratic National Convention, which takes place the week of July
17. The House Labor Committee passed a wage increase in March.
   Senate Labor Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
sponsor of the compromise, said the panel's vote ``brings us a
major step closer to our goal of raising the minimum wage for the
first time since 1981.''
   Five million men and women will gain by the increase ``and they
deserve it,'' Kennedy said. ``They're the working poor. They'd
rather work than live on welfare, and they deserve a living wage.
   ``For 50 years, the minimum wage has been a promise by America
that if you work for a living, you won't have to live in poverty.
Reaganomics broke that promise and it's time for Congress to fix
it.''
   Kennedy did not waste time in getting the committee vote to send
the measure to the floor. As soon as a quorum was formed at a
hastily-called meeting in the Capitol, the vote was taken.
   Although Republicans indicated a week ago that they would offer
amendments in committee, none was introduced.
   ``There was no reason to take on those issues in committee,''
said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah. ``There will be amendments when
the bill gets to the floor. I am sure we can conjure up some.''
   He predicted that floor action ``will be a donnybrook. There is
a lot of irritation on this bill. They (Democrats) haven't had the
intestinal fortitude to bring up the bill before now.''
   Hatch said the increase in the minimum wage ``could cost up to a
million jobs, especially those that need them - black youths and
(Hispanic) youths. We just can't write them off.''
   Republicans in both the House and Senate are expected to offer
amendments that would cap the increase at $4 an hour, provide a
training wage and exempt all small companies from the wage
requirement.
   The 11-5 committee vote was mainly along party lines, with
Republicans Robert T. Stafford of Vermont and Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
of Connecticut joining the nine-Democrat majority.
   The Kennedy compromise was worked out between Democratic
congressional leaders and organized labor after it became clear
that the initial proposal approved by the House Labor Committee was
going nowhere.
   The Kennedy bill would raise the current $3.35 an hour minimum
wage to $3.75 in 1989, $4.15 in 1990 and $4.55 in 1991.
   The exemption for small businesses would be raised to cover
companies with annual sales of $500,000 or less. The exemption
currently applies to companies with sales of $362,000 or less.
   In addition, the bill would increase the so-called tip credit
for restaurant workers from 40 percent to 50 percent by Jan. 1,
1990.
   Employers are currently allowed to count 40 percent of an
employee's tips toward payment of the minimum wage.
   Kennedy and Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Labor Committee, initially sponsored legislation that would
have raised the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour over a three-year
period, then ``index'' all future increases by tying them to the
inflation rate.
   Opposition to the indexing provision by a number of Democrats on
the House committee forced the leadership to abandon it before the
bill could get out of subcommittee. In place of indexing, the House
committee voted to increase the minimum wage to $5.05 over four
years.
   When the bill reaches the House floor, after the Senate acts,
Reps. Tommy Robinson, D-Ark., and Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa., will
substitute the Kennedy version of $4.55 an hour for the one passed
by the House committee.

CONGRESS ENACTS $4.25 MINIMUM WAGE; BUSH PRAISED FOR BACKING COMPROMISE

<P>
Congress completed action Wednesday on a compromise bill to raise the federal 
minimum wage to $4.25 an hour and sent it to the White House for President 
Bush's promised signature. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, in a swift follow-up to overwhelming approval in the House last 
week, beat back proposed amendments that would have aided small business and 
agricultural interests and passed the measure, 89 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
The bill provides for the federal minimum wage to rise from the current $3.35 
an hour to $3.80 next April 1, then to $4.25 a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush vetoed a bill last June that would have raised the basic pay rate 
to $4.55 an hour over three years, he was praised by Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and others for his support of the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"The working poor are about to receive an increase, although it is not as much 
as they deserve," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate 
Labor and Human Resources Committee and chief sponsor of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he would do his best to see that another increase, effective in 
the presidential election year of 1992, is passed. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors said that about 11 million workers would benefit from the increase. In 
a concession to Bush, the bill would also establish for the first time a lower 
"training rate" for teen-agers during their first 60 days of working. Employers 
could pay the lower wage for 60 days longer if their training programs are 
approved by the Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
California, which already has a $4.25-an-hour minimum wage, would not be 
affected by the federal legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The President at first proposed raising the base wage to $4.25 an hour over 
three years, with a lower rate for six months for all newly hired workers, 
regardless of age or previous experience. At one point, he said that he would 
veto any bill that differed from his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
President Ronald Reagan successfully opposed any increase in the minimum wage 
during his eight years in the White House, on grounds that it would be 
inflationary and would price younger, unskilled workers out of the job market. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) made the same arguments Wednesday, but Bush's 
endorsement of the bill ensured its passage through the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the raise said that the average hourly pay for all rank-and-file 
workers has climbed to $9.70 an hour and that starting pay for even menial jobs 
is now $5 or $6 an hour in many parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who has been a frequent critic of Bush in recent weeks, paid tribute 
to him during the closing debate. 
</P>
<P>
"We owe a debt of gratitude to the President, who was willing to stand up and 
come out for a minimum wage increase, contrary to the previous Administration," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy took a more critical view, saying that the Bush-backed compromise "owes 
more to the ideological embarrassment of those seeking tax relief for capital 
gains than it does to any real commitment to the minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole praised the outcome in a statement, 
saying: "With the Senate passage of the minimum wage bill, the President's 
commitment to a reasonable wage hike coupled with a meaningful training wage is 
finally fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
At the $4.25 hourly rate, a person working full time would earn $170 a week, or 
$8,840 a year. That is below the federal poverty-level income of $12,100 a year 
for a family of four.

CONGRESS PASSES $4.55 WAGE FLOOR BILL IN FACE OF VETO

<P>
The Senate gave final approval Wednesday to a bill raising the federal minimum 
wage to $4.55 an hour -- setting the stage for a certain veto by President Bush 
and a major confrontation with the White House over how far Democrats can push 
on social issues. 
</P>
<P>
Bush reiterated Wednesday that he will veto the legislation, arguing in a 
speech before a retailers' conference that it would force employers to cut back 
on the number of new entry-level jobs they create and that it would ultimately 
exacerbate inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the majority in the Congress rejects my offer of a reasonable compromise," 
he said, "a veto is going to be inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has proposed an increase to no more than $4.25 an hour, to take effect in 
1992 rather than in 1991, as the bill passed Wednesday provides. 
</P>
<P>
The President reasserted Wednesday that he would not accept any increase that 
exceeds his own proposal -- a point underscored by White House Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu. He had told the same group earlier that "$4.25 is fine" but 
"$4.26 is vetoland -- now and forever." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic strategists conceded that Bush appeared to have the upper hand in 
the standoff. The 63-37 vote in the Senate fell short of the two-thirds 
majority that Democrats would need to override a veto. The measure was passed 
May 11 by the House on a 247-172 vote, also short of a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Democrats would seek to scale back the size of the 
increase after Bush vetoes the new legislation or simply allow the measure to 
languish and use the veto as a political issue to paint the Administration as 
uncaring about the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats already have compromised somewhat by agreeing to create a new 
subminimum wage that would enable employers to pay new workers with fewer than 
60 days' experience 85% of the minimum in an effort to stave off any job cuts 
from the increase in labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who led the Democratic effort on the Senate 
floor, challenged as "a sham" Bush's assertions that he had attempted to 
compromise with Congress. " 'Let them eat cake' is the message (to the poor) 
from the White House," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's hard-line stance is only partly on economic grounds. White House 
strategists said the President must draw the line now on the minimum wage issue 
or Democrats will be emboldened to challenge him with more-expensive proposals 
on other social issues, such as child care. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts contend that, with unemployment now so low -- and labor scarce -- 
the measure would have little real economic impact. Only a few million workers 
of the 99 million now in the work force actually earn the federal minimum wage, 
which is $3.35 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the eight years since the last increase in the federal minimum 
wage, many states -- including California -- have enacted state minimums that 
are higher than the federal minimum. California's minimum wage, for example, is 
$4.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a veto by Bush later this month would put the Democrats in 
something of a quandary. Mainstream Democrats, led by Kennedy and Rep. Augustus 
F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), have made the minimum wage issue a major agenda 
item this year. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's hard-line position on the issue stands in sharp contrast to the more 
conciliatory approach he has taken in other areas, such as foreign affairs and 
reduction of the budget deficit, where he has sought to hammer out bipartisan 
accords. 
</P>
<P>
It also marks a major break with the Ronald Reagan Administration, which had 
consistently opposed any increase in the minimum wage. Bush announced the shift 
during the 1988 presidential campaign but tempered it with a demand that 
Congress enact a subminimum training wage. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the retailers' group Wednesday, the President sought to 
portray the Democratic-sponsored legislation as likely to hurt low-income 
workers by depriving them of jobs. He disagreed with Democratic assertions that 
the difference between his stance and theirs is "three thin dimes." 
</P>
<P>
"My difference with the majority in Congress is not about 30 cents an hour on 
the minimum wage legislation; it's about hundreds of thousands of people . . . 
who won't have a job to go to if the minimum wage legislation before the 
Congress now becomes law," Bush told the group. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sign the legislation pending in Congress and go back to the tired agenda 
of government intervention that so often hurts the very people it attempts to 
help, or we can step forward to keep America on the path to a competitive 
future," he said.

   Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin today said a
proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $5.05 an hour over
the next four years may sound ``like the right thing to do'' but it
actually would cause a loss of jobs.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said the proposed increase, likely to be
approved next week by the House Education and Labor Committee,
would be particularly hard on young people with no skills who are
seeking their first jobs.
   ``This is a tough one. $5.05 an hour, I'm afraid would make
almost any economist have some jitters,'' Mrs. McLaughlin said in
an interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``The body of economic
thinking is that the increase in the minimum wage, while
well-intentioned and it sounds like the right thing to do, actually
will cause a loss of jobs, particularly impacting on young people
who need to get into the workforce.''
   Education and Labor Committee Chairman Augustus F. Hawkins,
D-Calif., scheduled a session next Wednesday for final action on
the minimum wage bill. The panel had been unable on Thursday to
address all the amendments to a proposal that was approved by the
House labor standards subcommittee a week ago.
   The subcommittee approved an increase from $3.35 to $4.65 an
hour over a three-year period, with a 50-cent raise in 1989 and a
40-cent jump in both 1990 and 1991.
   During the full committee's hearing, Rep. Carl C. Perkins,
D-Ky., proposed an amendment for an increase of another 40 cents in
1992 in an effort to keep the federal minimum at approximately one
half of the nation's average wage.
   The committee approved the Perkins amendment on a vote of 18-14
with only two Democrats, Reps. Austin J. Murphy of Pennsylvania and
Timothy J. Penny of Minnesota, joining Republicans in opposing the
proposal.
   Murphy, chairman of the labor standards subcommittee, said his
panel had fashioned a measure which would be acceptable to the full
House and the Senate and possibly the White House.
   ``We don't know what impact the fourth year will have on the
loss of jobs,'' Murphy said.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., however, read from a letter
written to Hawkins by Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin who said
senior White House advisers would recommend to President Reagan
that he veto any legislation increasing the minimum wage.
   ``It doesn't matter what we do; the executive will be against
it,'' he said.
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Tex., who opposes any increase, proposed an
amendment to the Perkins measure to raise the base to $20 an hour,
but withdrew it after Hawkins called it absurd.
   The committee approved 20-13 an amendment by Rep. Tommy F.
Robinson, D-Ark., to increase the ``tip credit'' for restaurant
employers.
   Current law allows employers of workers who regularly receive
tips _ such as waiters and waitresses _ to count the tips as earned
wages equivalent to 40 percent of the minimum wage.
   Thus, a restaurant owner could pay a worker $2.01 an hour, with
the remaining $1.34 _ 40 percent of today's $3.35-an-hour minimum
wage _ supposed to come from tips.
   The Robinson proposal would increase the credit to 50 percent.
   The Senate has a companion bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Labor and Human Resources
Committee, which raises the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour over a
three-year period.

   The House voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981, casting a solid 382-37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President Bush. 

   The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor. 
Advocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise, to $4.25 an hour by April 1991, is too small for the working poor, while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs. 

   But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress, after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise. 

   So both sides accepted the compromise, which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977, raising the wage to $3.35 an hour from $2.65. 
Under the measure passed yesterday, the minimum wage would rise to $3.80 next April. 

   The Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it. 

   "There are no smiles about this bill," Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont.) said during House floor debate yesterday. 
But "because it's all we've got, I'm going to vote for it." 

   While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage, the level of $4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35% of average factory pay, Mr. Williams said. 

   But Rep. Marge Roukema (R., N.J.) instead praised the House's acceptance of a new youth "training" wage, a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years. 
Adopting a training-wage policy means "getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage," Mrs. Roukema said. 

   Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage, but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force. 

   Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea, but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence. 
The compromise sets the training wage at $3.35 an hour next April, and at $3.61 an hour, or 85% of the minimum wage, in April 1991. 

   Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days, without restriction, to workers with less than six months of job experience, and for another 90 days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers. 
The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old. 

   The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job. 

   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, still opposed to any mininum-wage increase, said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27% in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 "will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers."

   The Senate rejected President Bush's minimum
wage plan Tuesday and moved closer to confronting him with
legislation raising the hourly figure to $4.55, which he repeatedly
has promised to veto.
   The Senate, on a 61-39 vote largely along party lines, backed an
amendment to legislation sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., that brought the measure essentially in line with a
House-passed bill that would boost the minimum wage to $4.55 by
October 1991.
   Rejected, by 58-41, was Bush's proposal to increase the minimum
wage by 30 cents a year from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.25 in
January 1992. It was the second time Bush's proposal was defeated
in Congress; the House rejected it three weeks ago.
   The Senate's action brought a quick response from the Bush
administration.
   ``Today Congress had a golden opportunity,'' Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole said after the vote. ``But Senate Democrats
squandered the chance, the first chance in eight years, to raise
the minimum wage.''
   More amendments were being considered before the legislation
faced a final Senate vote, likely to come Wednesday, but no further
significant changes were expected before then.
   ``We compromised,'' said Kennedy, referring to his past
proposals to raise the minimum wage even higher. He also noted a
number of other changes in the legislation, including expanded
exemptions for small businesses, to meet Republican concerns.
   ``The president's approach is a far superior approach,'' Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in his unsuccessful effort to win support
for substituting Bush's proposal for the Kennedy bill.
   The action seemed to guarantee the first domestic-policy
showdown between Congress and Bush, barring a compromise while the
bill is before a conference committee that will work out minor
differences between the House and Senate versions.
   Such a deal, however, appears unlikely.
   ``There isn't going to be a compromise,'' said Senate Republican
leader Robert Dole of Kansas. ``It's going to be $4.25 an hour and
a six-month training wage, period.''
   Democrats nonetheless called on Bush to accept their proposal.
   ``If there is any one thing that the 101st Congress must do it
is to increase the minimum wage,'' said Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, chastising Bush for opposing a $4.55 an
hour minimum wage while supporting expanded capital gains tax
breaks for the wealthy. ``This legislation will be a test of
whether we indeed are seeking a kindler, gentler nation,'' said
Mitchell.
   Both the defeated Bush proposal and the amended Kennedy bill
contain provisions allowing some workers to be paid a wage below
the federal minimum wage.
   Bush has insisted that provision extend for six months to all
newly hired workers, regardless of prior work experience.
   Kennedy, like the sponsors of the House bill, balked at that
proposal but to win the support of moderate and conservative
Democrats agreed on a two-month period during which some employees
could be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage.
   That provision was contained in the amendment, offered by
Democratic Sens. Bob Graham of Florida and David Pryor of Arkansas.
   ``Our training wage proposal is a proper balance of the need to
train new workers and the need to set a fair minimum wage,'' said
Graham.
   The Graham-Pryor amendment requires an employee to hold one job
for at least 30 days before the two-month training period would
expire. The House-passed bill also allows for a two-month training
period at a subminimum wage but only if the affected employee had
no prior job experience.

Congressional Democrats will try again to give the nation's lowest-paid workers 
a raise, their first in nearly nine years. Increasing the federal minimum wage 
beyond the current $3.35-an-hour has proven a difficult task because of strong 
opposition from business interests and a majority of Republicans. Democrats 
have accepted the fact that the only chance of getting an increase in the rate 
is a compromise that President Bush can live with. They are putting one 
together. 
</P>
<P>
The President in June vetoed legislation sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) and Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-L.A.) that would have raised the 
hourly rate to $4.55 over three years. He argued that the increase was 
excessive and inflationary and would cost thousands ofjobs. Bush, who during 
the 1988 campaign promised to raise the minimum wage, indicated he was willing 
to approve a more modest boost, to $4.25 an hour, but only if the legislation 
includeda lower sub-minimum training wage for new workers. 
</P>
<P>
Compromise legislation, introduced by Rep. Austin J. Murphy (D-Pa.), would 
raise the minimum wage to $4.25 as Bush has insisted upon. The increase -- only 
90 cents an hour -- would bespread over two rather than three years. The 
sub-minimum would last for 60 days. At thispoint, it offers the best chance for 
the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
The modest raise would boost a weekly salary based on the federal minimum wage 
from $134 to $170. That's not much, and it won't make up for the losses in 
buying power due to inflation over the years. But a small raise is better than 
none. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 5.4 million Americans earn the minimum wage. Their ranks include 
many teen-agers and new workers, but at least half are older than 25, and many 
are working parents who could bring more money into the house with a welfare 
check. For a parent with two children, welfare and related benefits are worth 
more than a pay check based on the federal minimum wage in 23 states, according 
to Isabel V. Sawhill, an economist at the Urban Institute. Yet thousands of 
poor Americans choose to work for less. They deserve more. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush can encourage Americans who are willing to work. He can help 
working mothers who are trying to help themselves. He can help working fathers 
who are taking responsibility for their families. A compromise on the minimum 
wage is the best hope of achieving those goals.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Increase In Minimum Wage To $5.05 Over 4
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An increase in the federal minimum wage from
$3.35 to $5.05 an hour was tentatively approved Thursday by the
House Education and Labor Committee.
   The original bill before the committee called for an increase of
50 cents in 1989, 40 cents in 1990 and 40 cents in 1991 to $4.65.
   The committee adopted, on a vote of 18-14, an amendment by Rep.
Carl C. Perkins, D-Ky., which added a 40-cent increase in the
fourth year, on Dec. 31, 1991.
   The full committee was unable to take action on all the pending
amendments and will continue debate on the bill next week.
   The Senate has a companion bill, sponsored by Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, which
would raise the minimum wage to $4.65 over a three-year period.
   The Perkins amendment was approved essentially along party lines
except that two Democrats, Reps. Austin J. Murphy of Pennsylvania
and Timothy J. Penny of Minnesota, joined the Republicans in
opposing the proposal.
   Murphy is chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee,
which had approved an increase to $4.65. He said that legislation
was ``crafted so that it will be accepted by the full House and the
executive branch. If we accept this (Perkins) proposal, it will not
be accepted.''
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., read from a letter written by
Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, who said senior White House
advisers would recommend to President Reagan that he veto any
legislation increasing the minimum wage.
   ``So it doesn't matter what we do, the executive will be against
it,'' Solarz said.
   The House committee also voted 20-13 on an amendment by Rep.
Tommy F. Robinson, D-Ark., to increase the ``tip credit'' for
restaurant workers.
   Current law allows employers of workers who regularly receive
tips _ such as waiters and waitresses _ to count the tips as earned
wages equivalent to 40 percent of the minimum wage. Thus, a
restaurant owner could pay a worker $2.01 an hour, with the
remaining $1.34 - 40 percent of today's $3.35-an-hour minimum wage
_ coming from tips.
   Under the Robinson amendment, the tip minimum would be raised to
50 percent of the minimum. Thus, if the minimum wage were increased
to $5.05 an hour, an employer could pay a $2.52 hourly wage, with
the other $2.52 coming from tips.
   The biggest argument of the session came over the amendment by
Perkins who said his proposal ``does not go far enough, but it is a
start.''
   ``It gives the American worker some level of decency,'' Perkins
said.
   He said his amendment would still not bring workers up to what
is described by the federal government as the ``poverty level,'' a
family of three earning approximately $9,500.
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Tex., who opposes any increase in the minimum
wage because he said he would destroy jobs, proposed an amendment
to raise the base to $20 an hour.
   ``I don't think we ought to be pikers,'' he said. ``It would put
minimum wage workers on the par with members of Congress.''
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., the committee chairman,
called the proposal ``absurd.'' Armey said he thought the entire
discussion was absurd because the committee refused to discuss the
number of jobs that would be lost because of the minimum wage
increase.
   Armey, an economist, said different studies show anywhere from
300,000 to 800,000 job opportunities would be lost because of the
increase. Hawkins said there was not support for such projections.

   Moves by Congress to raise the federal minimum
wage this year will put presidential candidates on the spot and
force them to take a position on the issue, the chairman of the
House labor committee says.
   ``They like to say they are for a good education or a living
wage for everyone,'' said Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins. ``They will
have to discuss in detail the numbers that Congress sets. They
won't be able to just say they are for a living wage.''
   The House Labor and Education Committee on Wednesday ignored the
threat of a presidential veto and approved legislation to raise the
minimum wage from $3.35 per hour to $5.05 over the next four years.
   The measure, which passed after numerous Republican attempts to
weaken or gut it, now goes to the full House.
   ``This will be one of the great election issues,'' Hawkins,
D-Calif., said in an interview. ``Each candidate will be pinned
down.''
   The Democratic-controlled committee approved the measure by
voice vote after rejecting a Republican proposal to permit a
special ``new hire'' wage of $3.35 an hour.
   Hawkins said he expected the full House to take up the
legislation within 10 days after members return April 11 from their
Easter recess.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee will take up a
similar bill during the week of April 11, according to its
chairman, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin says senior White House advisers
will urge President Reagan to veto any minimum wage increase that
would lead to a decrease in the number of job opportunities.
   The initial House bill would have raised the minimum to $4.65 an
hour over three years; that figure is still contained in the Senate
bill. The administration claims the proposal would result in
elimination of 880,000 jobs because employers won't be willing to
pay their workers that much.
   Under the House committee-passed bill, the minimum wage would go
to $3.85 an hour next year, $4.25 in 1990, $4.65 in 1991 and $5.05
in 1992.
   Last week, the committee added the fourth-year increase of 40
cents as a substitute for ``indexing'' _ or tying _ future raises
to inflation.
   Indexing was supported by Hawkins, Kennedy and organized labor,
but Democrats dropped the plan because they feared it would result
in little or no increase this year.
   The final version of the bill was sent to the House floor after
the committee defeated, 20-13, a proposal by Rep. Steve Bartlett,
R-Texas, to create a ``new hire'' or training wage by which
employers could pay new workers $3.35 an hour for 90 days.
   Bartlett said the White House told him the president would veto
any legislation not containing a lower starting wage.
   Rep. Matthew G. Martinez, D-Calif., called the training wage
proposal ``a sham, a joke and a fraud.'' He said it was ``nothing
more than a way to get around the minimum wage.''
   The committee also rejected another Bartlett amendment which
would have given private employers the right to grant compensatory
time off in lieu of wages for overtime.
   Also defeated by a voice vote was an amendment by Rep. Thomas E.
Petri, R-Wis., to permit employers to include the cost of fringe
benefits, such as health insurance, in the calculation of the
minimum wage and an amendment by Rep. William F. Goodling, R-Pa.,
to exempt motorcycle dealers from paying overtime.
   Robert McGlotten, legislative director of the AFL-CIO, said the
committee ``recognized the need to bring this nation's working poor
to at least the poverty level by gradually raising the minimum
wage.''

   President Bush on Friday signed a bill that
will raise the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.25 an hour by the
spring of 1991, formally accepting the compromise that ended a year
of disagreement with congressional Democrats and organized labor.
   Bush praised the measure, which he said would ``protect jobs and
put more money into the pockets of our workers.'' But Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said it merely marked progress ``to the
50-yard line'' on the issue.
   The increase, the first since 1981, would bring the wage to
$4.25 an hour by April 1991, after going to an intermediate $3.80
on April 1, 1990.
   The new law also includes a lower ``training wage'' for new
workers who are teen-agers, a provision sought by Bush but
initially opposed by congressional Democrats.
   Bush in June vetoed a bill that would have increased the minimum
wage to $4.55 over three years.
   At an Oval Office signing ceremony attended by congressional
leaders and sponsors, Bush called the new act ``a good example of
what we can do in the future on other matters.''
   ``I have called for an increase in the minimum wage that would
protect jobs and put more money into the pockets of our workers. In
my view, this bill does exactly that. I'm pleased to sign it,''
Bush said.
   However, Kennedy, D-Mass., who supported a higher minimum, said
after the ceremony, ``I think we've arrived on the 50-yard line on
this.''
   ``It's not as much as the working poor deserve, but it was a
real compromise and it brought the president's position to one of
not saying take it or leave it,'' Kennedy, chairman of the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee, told reporters.
   Kennedy said a Democratic-led effort to boost the wage further
in 1992, a presidential election year, was ``a live option.''
   Under terms of the new law, young people 16-to-19 years old who
have never worked could be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage for
90 days. Employers with a training plan in place could pay the
young workers a training rate for 90 days more.
   The training wage can be paid to workers 16-19 years old for
their first three months of work experience and for three
additional months provided they are in certified training programs.
   The training wage would be $3.35 an hour after next April 1.
When the minimum wage increases to $4.25 a year later, the
subminimum would increase to $3.61 an hour. The provision allowing
for the subminimum expires in April 1993 unless extended by
Congress.
   Bush called for a $4.25 minimum wage during his campaign.
   Also at the signing ceremony were Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole; Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.; Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan.; House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.; House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.; Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., and Rep.
William Goodling, R-Pa.
   Murphy is chairman of the House subcommittee on labor standards,
and Goodling is the senior Republican member on the House Education
and Labor Committee.

   The Senate headed today toward a final vote on
a compromise plan to raise the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour, which
some Republicans claimed would hurt the economy and cost young
workers their jobs.
   ``There is unanimous agreement, except among politicians, that
this is not the thing to do,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C, citing
studies that a higher minimum wage likely would fuel inflation and
make marginal businesses less likely to hire new workers. ``So what
do politicians do? They go ahead and do it.''
   The opposition of Helms and other Republicans notwithstanding,
the compromise plan agreed to by President Bush and congressional
Democrats was expcted to win final passage by day's end.
   The vote originally was planned for Tuesday but negotiations on a
plan to raise the federal debt limit stalled the minimum-wage
debate. That logjam was broken late Tuesday and the minimum-wage
bill was the first order of Senate business today.
   Several GOP senators were mulling amendments, despite an attempt
by the Bush administration to persuade them not to offer any. If
offered, none was expected to pass but debate on them would delay a
final vote, still expected later today.
   The compromise, passed by the House last week, would raise the
wage floor for the first time since it reached $3.35 an hour in 1981.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, in a letter Tuesday, reminded
senators the administration supported the compromise approved by the
House and ``accordingly I ask for your support of this same bill now
before the Senate with no amendments attached.''
   Aides to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he planned to offer an
amendment to exempt small businesses from the increase in the
minimum wage. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said today he also might
offer an amendment but did not offer details.
   The minimum wage, paid to an estimated 4 million Americans, would
rise to $3.80 next April 1 and to $4.25 a year later under the
legislation.
   It also would create a subminimum for workers 16 to 19 years old
new to the job market. All workers in that age group could be paid
the subminimum for their first three months of work experience and
up to six months provided they were in certified training programs
for the final three months.
   The subminimum would be $3.35 when the minimum wage rose to
$3.80. It would rise to $3.61 when the minimum wage rose to $4.25.
The provision allowing the subminimum expires in 1993.

<HEAD>Democrats Budge a Bit on Minimum Wage; Bush Says He Won't</HEAD>

   Senate Democrats on Friday reduced the size of
the increase they are asking in the minimum wage but not enough for
President Bush who vowed again to veto any raise of more than 90
cents over three years.
   In the second day of debate on the measure, Democrats cut by a
dime to $4.55 the minimum wage they want in effect by October 1991
_ compared with the current $3.35 _ and agreed for the first time
to a 60-day subminimum for workers who are new on the job.
   Bush, however, declared he had ``no intention of budging one
inch'' on allowing a minimum wage that high or on accepting that
short a period during which employers could pay a ``training wage''
20 percent below the federal floor.
   ``I will veto any bill which exceeds a $4.25 wage level and
which does not contain a six-month training wage for new hires,''
he said in a letter Friday to Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole.
   Two showdown votes were scheduled for next Tuesday _ the first
on the latest compromise between Northern and Southern Democrats
and the second on what Bush said again is his only offer.
   ``We fired our best shot and last shot and only shot first,''
Bush told reporters at the White House. ``I have no inention of
budging one inch on this. I have too much at stake.''
   The leading proponent of the wage increase, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., appeared confident he had the 51 votes to pass
what essentially is the same bill approved by the House last month.
But he acknowledged he lacked the two-thirds majority required to
override a veto.
   ``They've come a long way,'' he said of the administration.
``We've come a long way. I would hope they don't again lay down
this line in the sand.''
   However, Dole said many Republicans believe Bush already ``has
gone too far'' on allowing an increase.
   The latest Democratic plan was put together by Kennedy and Sens.
Bob Graham of Florida and David Pryor of Arkansas.
   Like the House-passed bill, it would provide annual 40 cent
hourly increases, to $3.85 an hour on Oct. 1, to $4.25 on Oct. 1,
1990, and to $4.55 a year later. The orginal version called for a
50 cent increase this year.
   Bush's version calls for annual 30 cent increases, beginning
next January to $3.65 and then up to $3.95 in 1991 and $4.25 in
1992. The minimum wage has been frozen at $3.35 since 1981.
   The House and new Senate Democratic measures differ only in the
way they treat the 60-day training wage. Only if it is a worker's
first job could an employer pay the lower wage in the House
version. Under the Senate measure, a new worker would have to have
at least 60 days of experience in one or more jobs before his
employer would have to pay the higher scale.
   Bush's subminimum would allow employers to continue paying $3.35
to any new hire, regardless of their previousexperience, for six
months. That subminimum would rise to $3.40 an hour in 1992 under
the president's proposal.

<HEAD>House Democrat Offers Alternative Minimum Wage Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Democrat has proposed raising the
minimum wage to $4.25 by next year, but his attempt at breaking an
impasse between Congress and President Bush contains provisions the
White House has insisted it won't accept.
   Rep. Austin J. Murphy, D-Pa., introduced a revised minimum-wage
bill Wednesday, a week after Bush vetoed legislation that would have
raised the wage from $3.35 an hour to $4.55 by 1991.
   The House last week was unable to override the veto, Bush's first.
   Murphy, chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over
the minimum wage, proposed raising the hourly minimum wage to $3.80
on Oct. 1 and to $4.25 a year later.
   His final target matches that of Bush, although the minimum wage
would not reach $4.25 an hour until January 1992 under the
president's proposal.
   Murphy's proposal gave no ground on the issue on which the
majority Democrats in Congress and Bush have their greatest
difference _ whether employers should be allowed to pay newly hired
workers a subminimum wage for an initial training period.
   Bush has said he will not support any increase in the minimum
wage unless Congress also establishes a new subminimum wage
employers could pay all new workers for up to six months.
   Democrats intially resisted any attempts to establish a
subminimum wage, but eventually included in the measure Bush vetoed
a provision allowing the lower wage to be paid to workers with fewer
than 60 days' work experience.
   Murphy included the same 60-day provision in his bill.
   ``I reject the president's call for a six-month training wage,
mainly because it is excessive and unfair,'' Murphy said in a
statement.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., has re-introduced legislation in
the Senate identical to the measure Bush vetoed, but has indicated a
willingness to discuss a compromise with the White House.
   Administration officials have said Bush's proposal is the only
acceptable one.

   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
approved legislation Wednesday to gradually raise the minimum wage
$1.30 an hour to $4.65 after rejecting a Bush administration plan
for a smaller increase coupled with a reduced ``training wage.''
   President Bush has said he would veto legislation raising the
minimum above $4.25 an hour and told GOP leaders Wednesday that, in
the words of press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, his proposal ``is
fair and firm and his last offer.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the labor committee chairman, said he was
hopeful ``we can reach a compromise that is fairer to the working
poor and that President Bush will sign.''
   Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the full Senate could
consider the measure next week. ``We're all set to go to the floor
right away,'' he said. ``I think we'll have strong support.''
   The minimum wage, now $3.35 an hour, has not been raised in eight
years.
   Kennedy said he is ``glad to listen'' to Republican calls for a
sub-minimum wage, but only if it is coupled with specific
requirements for training and education.
   Kennedy predicted a veto would be overridden.
   ``We're going to get this legislation achieved,'' he said. ``If
it's the judgment that (Bush will) veto it, we'll override it,''
Kennedy told reporters after the meeting.
   The committee approved the $1.30 increase on an 11-5 vote, with
Republican Sens. David Durenberger of Minnesota and James Jeffords
of Vermont voting with the panel's nine Democrats. The approval came
after Democrats, joined by Durenberger, rejected the White House
proposal to raise the hourly minimum 30 cents each year for three
years, to $4.25.
   The House subcommittee on labor standards has scheduled a
Thursday meeting to draft legislation similar to Kennedy's bill.
Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and
Labor Committee, plans to have the full panel consider the $4.65 an
hour minimum wage, which he has said he strongly supports.
   Bush's proposal, long opposed by Democrats and organized labor,
would establish a ``training wage'' of $3.35 an hour, the current
minimum for all workers, and allow employers to pay newly hired
workers at that rate for their first six months on the job.
   While opposition to the sub-miminum wage has softened, Kennedy
said Wednesday that such a category would have to be sharply limited
from what the administration wants.
   ``I'm not going to see the corruption of the minimum wage by
using the words `training wage' to throw older workers out of work
and displace those who want to work 40 hours a week,'' Kennedy said.
   ``I'm open to listening, to having the educational components
outlined,'' he added. ``There was nothing in the administration
proposal that had an educational component.''
   He said such a plan would also have to be limited to first-time
workers and be for a shorter duration than six months.
   Kennedy, while noting the administration's threatened veto,
agreed that Bush's call for an increase in the minimum wage had
boosted chances that some increase will soon be approved.
   ``This administration has been more forthcoming than the previous
eight years,'' the senator said.
   The committee approved three amendments to the bill Kennedy
introduced.
   The first mirrors a provision in the White House plan to raise
the level at which small businesses are exempted from minimum wage
provisions from gross annual sales of $362,000 to $500,000.
   Another proposal, also supported by Bush, would raise from 40
percent to 50 percent the so-called tip credit. Employers are
allowed to count a certain percentage of tips toward the reported
salaries of workers covered by the minimum wage.
   The committee also accepted a proposal to extend federal minimum
wage standards to Puerto Rico.

   Senate Democrats opened debate on a
minimum-wage bill by thanking President Bush for his support of an
increase but moving forward with their own plan after criticizing
the president's as too modest and his attitude as too reticent.
   ``Don't give us a take-it-or-leave-it proposal,'' Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said Thursday after Bush promised again to veto
any bill other than his. ``That's the kind of administration we've
had the last eight years. Confrontation. Confrontation.
Confrontation.''
   It appears, however, that a showdown is inevitable if not
imminent.
   Sponsors were hoping for a final vote today but were unable to
reach agreement with Republicans, meaning the debate likely will
extend into next week. Amendments lowering the final minimum wage
target to $4.55 from $4.65 and providing for a 60-day subminimum
wage for new workers were likely to be offered with the resumption
of debate today.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican floor leader, urged
Democrats to accept Bush's proposal as a compromise.
   ``President Bush has extended an opportunity to the Congress to
enact a minimum wage increase,'' Hatch said. ``In my opinion, it is
a worthy alternative to the proposal now before us.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. and chief sponsor of the Senate
bill, entered into a compromise with Southern Democrats over the
$4.55 top minimum that appears to give him more than enough votes
to win passage.
   Bush, however, appears to have the votes necessary to sustain a
veto.
   The amendments would bring the Senate bill in line with a
House-passed measure. Whether the bill would go straight to Bush
appears dependent on the Senate provisions for the subminimum. The
proposal being discussed late Thursday was slightly different from
what is in the House bill.
   The House-passed bill allows a subminimum to be paid to new
hires for two months but only if it was their first job. The
tentative Senate provision allows the subminimum to be paid to any
worker in that worker's first 60 days in the job market, regardless
of how many jobs the person held in that period. Both proposals
would abolish the subminimum in October 1992.
   Kennedy opened the debate by saying Bush's support for some
increase was a welcome change after the Reagan administration's
dogged opposition to any boost.
   ``Eight years of stonewalling against the minimum wage are
over,'' said Kennedy. Still, he said Bush's proposal ``gives too
little protection'' to the nation's low-wage workers.
   The minimum wage has been $3.35 since 1981.
   Both the House-passed bill and the amendments Kennedy promised
to support would raise the hourly minimum wage to $3.85 on Oct. 1,
to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year later.
   Bush's proposal calls for an increase to $3.65 on Jan. 1, 1990,
to $3.95 a year later and a final jump to $4.25 on Jan. 1, 1992.
The president's measure would allow employers to pay new workers
$3.35 an hour for their first six months. That subminimum would
rise to $3.40 an hour in 1992.

The House, setting the stage for a confrontation with President Bush, on 
Thursday approved a measure increasing the federal minimum wage to $4.55 an 
hour by 1991. Bush, who supports an increase to $4.25, has vowed to veto any 
legislation providing for a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
On a 247-172 vote, the House passed a final version of the measure and sent it 
to the Senate, which is expected to endorse the legislation next week. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, who sponsored the increase to $4.55, fell short of the 289 votes 
that would be needed in the House to override a presidential veto. Still, they 
predicted a tough fight over the issue and taunted Bush for refusing to support 
their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Three Thin Dimes' 
</P>
<P>
"What this all comes down to is three thin dimes, that's the difference between 
us and the President," said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). "We're talking about 
helping the millions of people who work but live in poverty and giving them a 
living wage." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans shot back, however, that Bush supported a 90-cent increase in the 
minimum wage, from the current $3.35 rate to $4.25. The President "supports an 
increase of nine fat dimes and that shouldn't be forgotten," said Rep. Bill 
Goodling (R-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
Under the House legislation, the minimum hourly wage would increase to $3.85 on 
Oct. 1, 1989, to $4.25 in 1990 and to $4.55 by 1991. The current hourly rate 
has not been increased since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In a compromise intended to satisfy concerns voiced by Bush, the measure would 
allow employers to pay new workers a training wage not less than $3.35 per hour 
or 85% of the minimum wage rate, whichever is greater. Employers could pay the 
subminimum wage to all new workers until their individual experience in the 
work force totals 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Both Democrats and Republicans agreed that the minimum wage should be 
increased. But they clashed over the impact of the proposed $4.55 hourly rate. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual use of props, Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) held aloft different 
glass bowls filled with dimes to compare the increase called for in the 
Democratic-backed measure with the increases in salaries earned by public 
officials and business executives. 
</P>
<P>
One bowl, containing 400 dimes, illustrated the $40-per-hour increase in the 
vice president's salary called for in recommendations made by Bush, he said. 
Another bowl, holding three dimes, showed the difference between Bush and 
Democrats over the proposed increase in the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter of elemental fairness for the working poor of this country," 
Wright said. "These are people who work, and they pay taxes. They do work that 
most people don't want to do, and they deserve better treatment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Purchasing Power 
</P>
<P>
Other sponsors noted that the cost of living has increased 40% since 1981, 
while the purchasing power of the minimum wage has decreased nearly 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"It is astonishing to me that George Bush is using the full power of his 
presidency to keep poor working people from earning an extra 30 cents an hour," 
said California Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae). "I can't understand anyone 
who says our nation can't afford that." 
</P>
<P>
However, Republicans predicted that the $4.55 hourly rate would cause employers 
to eliminate nearly 670,000 low-paying jobs across the nation and said that 
Democrats were playing politics with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a futile exercise and everyone here knows that," said Rep. Thomas E. 
Petri (R-Wis.). "The President will veto this, and his veto will be sustained. 
Those in favor of this hope only to score a few political points, and I doubt 
whether they will even do that."

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Battle Shifts To Senate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House passage of a plan to raise the minimum
wage shifts the partisan battle to the Senate, where the leading
proponent of an increase is urging President Bush to refrain from
further veto threats while Congress settles on a final bill.
   The House voted 248-171 Thursday in favor of legislation that
would raise the minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.55
by October 1991, with the first increase taking effect later this
year.
   The House then joined the Senate on an Easter recess that ends
April 3.
   High on the Senate agenda when it returns is a bill sponsored by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that would raise the minimum wage
to $4.65 by 1992.
   Kennedy has said he is open to amending his bill, and in a
statement issued after the House vote he asked Bush, who has
threatened to veto any attempt to raise the hourly minimum above
$4.25, to keep an open mind until the House and Senate agree on a
bill.
   ``This is an excellent opportunity for Congress and the
administration to demonstrate that they can work together and in
doing so achieve a fair increase in the minimum wage and an honest
training wage,'' Kennedy said.
   Bush has insisted that a six-month sub-minimum training wage
covering all newly hired employees be created in any legislation to
raise the minimum wage, a provision he said will help offset
potential job losses caused by raising the minimum.
   Sponsors of the House bill, while disputing GOP projections of
massive job losses, added a provision allowing a sub-minimum wage to
be paid to new hires for two months provided it was their first job.
   That falls far short of the White House demand and, with Kennedy
also opposed to Bush's training-wage proposal, that issue likely
will be a major sticking point in any attempts to reach a compromise.
   Several Republicans insisted that Democrats were going to have to
give in to Bush _ who appears to have the votes to sustain a veto _
or let a ninth year pass without any change in the minimum wage.
   ``The question is do you want a bill or do you want a political
issue?'' Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., said during an unsuccessful
GOP effort to substitute Bush's proposal for the House leadership's
measure. ``If you truly want to raise the minimum wage this is the
only game in town.''
   But Democrats argued they had given enough by cutting the final
increase from $4.65 an hour to $4.55 and by adding the new-hire wage.
   As amended, the House bill would boost the minimum wage to $3.85
an hour on Oct. 1, to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year
later. The provision for the new-hire wage, to be pegged at 85
percent of the minimum wage, would expire Sept. 30, 1992.
   It also would expand exemptions allowing small businesses to pay
wages lower than the minimum wage and would allow employers of
workers who earn tips to pay them 50 percent of the minimum wage,
down from the current 60 percent.
   Current law exempts service businesses with annual sales of less
than $362,000 from the minimum-wage law; the House bill increased
that level to $500,000. The provision is rarely used, however,
because of confusing regulations lawmakers say will be simplified in
conference committee if the Senate passes a minimum-wage bill.

   The House today overwhelmingly approved
legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25 by April 1991
and establish a lower training wage for some teen-agers new to the
job market.
   The 382-37 vote came just a day after the White House and
Democratic congressional leaders reached agreement on the plan,
which would provide the first increase in the $3.35 minimum wage
since 1981.
   President Bush vetoed an earlier bill to raise the minimum wage
to $4.55 an hour, and the Democratic-controlled House sustained the
veto.
   Senate leaders have promised to vote on the compromise soon in
hopes of getting it to the White House for Bush's signature before
Thanksgiving.
   Many lawmakers from both parties found fault with the
compromise, with Democrats saying the increase was not big enough
and some Republicans saying there should be no boost. But most said
the deal was the best political compromise possible.
   ``No one got exactly what they wanted,'' said Rep. William
Goodling of Pennsylvania, ranking Republican on the House Education
and Labor Committee. ``I think we got the best that we could.''
   Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo., said the increase should have been
bigger but passage of the compromise ``represents this body's
commitment to an honest day's pay for an honest day's work.''
   Before the debate, House Speaker Thomas Foley said final passage
of the proposal would mark ``one of the major achievements of the
101st Congress.''
   ``A year or two ago it seemed as though no compromise was in
sight,'' said Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa.
   Foley attributed President Bush's decision to drop his refusal
to compromise on the issue to the fact that Democrats were close to
getting a veto-proof majority on a bill of their own. He said
Republicans found it ``embarrassing'' for Bush not to give in on
the minimum wage while demanding a capital gains tax cut for the
wealthy.
   The measure would create a new ``subminimum wage'' for
teen-agers with little job experience, allowing them to be paid 85
percent of the minimum wage for their first three months in the
work force. The lower rate could be extended for another three
months if an employer showed that the youths were receiving
specific skills training.
   ``This package offers the promise of better wages for the
working men and women of this country and gives incentives to
create new jobs for our young people,'' Bush said in a written
statement that commended organized labor and congressional leaders.
   Both sides made significant concessions in an effort to avoid a
repeat of Bush's veto of minimum wage legislation earlier this
year, which was sustained by the House.
   Democrats acknowledged giving ground but said it was necessary
to guarantee a boost in the minimum wage, which has been frozen at
$3.35 an hour since January 1981 in a stalemate that lasted
throughout the Reagan administration. Democrats promised to
reconsider the issue before the 1992 presidential and congressional
elections.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said organized labor would
``welcome the long overdue agreement on the minimum wage'' and
urged Congress to pass it swiftly.
   The compromise would boost the minimum wage to $3.80 on April 1
and provide the final 45-cent increase to $4.25 on April 1, 1991.
The subminimum wage, for workers age 16 to 19 in their first jobs,
would be 85 percent of the prevailing minimum wage except for in
the first year of the increase, for which lawmakers added a
provision barring it from being below the current $3.35 an hour
minimum. The subminimum would be $3.61 when the minimum wage rose
to $4.25.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor
Committee, said the minimum wage would already be $4.79 an hour if
adjusted to account for inflation since 1981.
   ``That is the measure of how far we have failed the test of
fairness to the working poor,'' Kennedy said. ``Our only answer to
them is that this is the best compromise we can get from an
administration that wanted to give them even less.''
   The subminimum wage could be paid to any worker age 16 to 19
with less than three months total job experience. Once that
threshold was met, the subminimum could be paid for up to an
additional three months only when the employer had a training
program subject to Labor Department approval.
   No worker over age 20 or with six months' work experience could
be paid the subminimum wage, and the lower wage would expire in
April 1993 unless reauthorized by Congress.
   Democrats and labor long have considered such a ``training
wage'' unacceptable. However, it became clear that some such
provision would be necessary to strike a deal with the White House
or to achieve a veto-proof majority in the House.
   For his part, Bush gave up nine months from his offer to
increase the minimum wage to $4.25 in January 1992, and he also
conceded ground on the training wage. He had demanded a six-month
provision for all workers regardless of their age and prior work
experience.

FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (18): US
research causes rethink on pay theory - Minimum wages / Edward Balls
examines three studies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Once the bugbear of free-market analysts, minimum wages are finally seeking
intellectual respectability. Five years ago most economists would have
agreed with the proposition that minimum wages cost jobs. But in recent
years, a growing body of evidence has accumulated which, taken together,
provides a counter-blast to this conventional wisdom.
Not that conventional economic wisdom has a good track record. Not so long
ago most British economists would have sworn that a devaluation of the
currency would feed through into wage inflation. Even the most devout
advocates of monetary targets are a little more reticent these days in
pushing the predictive powers of their favourite measure.
Nor have policy-makers been inclined to accept the basic implications of
standard economic analysis, and minimum wages are no exception. The US
economy - closer to the classical economic textbook model then most
developed countries - has had a federal minimum wage for decades. And,
within Europe, only the UK has no minimum wage protection at either
national, regional, or sectoral level.
France, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Luxembourg have a statutory minimum
wage, while in Belgium and Greece a national minimum wage is set by
collective bargaining. In Germany, Italy and Denmark, pay minima for
individual sectors are set by binding collective agreements covering a large
proportion of the workforce while, in Ireland, legal minimum rates are set
for certain low-wage sectors such as hotels and catering.
But the minimum wage does appear to be one area where policy is leading
economic research. Anxious to investigate whether increases in minimum wages
really do reduce employment and therefore whether low-wage labour markets do
conform to the standard textbook theory, a distinguished group of US
economists has examined the effects of recent changes in state and federal
minimum wages. Their results have turned conventional wisdom upside down.
For these studies find that low-wage markets do not work like simple markets
on a Saturday morning. Setting a market-clearing price for strawberries is a
fairly straightforward process. If strawberries are plentiful then a
relatively high-price floor will lead to a glut. But the same logic does not
apply to labour markets - notions of fairness, commitment to particular jobs
and information about available alternatives make people a more complicated
commodity.
In fact, the classical assumptions about the labour market - that employers
can easily hire workers and that they can costlessly get all the information
they need about available jobs and wage rates - are almost never met in
practice. When turnover is rapid, and workers are young and inexperienced,
it is quite possible for different workers of the same age and with the same
skills to be paid very different wages, even in the same company. Under
these circumstances, the standard model does not apply.
The US studies, all published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in
Cambridge Massachusetts, are:
Card (1991). The increase in the US federal minimum wage in 1990, the first
for a decade, provided a good natural experiment to test the standard
economic theory. David Card, of Princeton University, examined the effect of
this increase in the federal minimum wage from Dollars 3.35 to Dollars 3.80
in 1990. He compared its impact on states with differing proportions of low
wage workers on the assumption that if the increase in the national minimum
wage reduced employment, then total employment should fall faster in
low-wage states such as Arkansas, compared to richer states such as
Massachusetts. In fact, Card found no significant differences in employment
growth in the following year while employment appeared to grow faster in the
low-wage states.
Katz &amp; Kreuger (1992). The federal minimum wage was again increased in 1991
 -from Dollars 3.80 to Dollars 4.25. Lawrence Katz, of Harvard University,
and Alan Kreuger, then at Princeton, conducted a survey of employment and
wages in 100 Burger King restaurants before and after the increase. Again
they found no evidence that employment fell. In fact, employment appeared to
rise and, more important, by a greater amount in those stores which
previously paid the lowest wages and therefore had to make up the biggest
increases.
Card and Kreuger (1993). The most compelling survey was conducted by
Kreuger, now chief economist at the US Labor Department, in conjunction with
Card. In April 1992, New Jersey increased its minimum wage from Dollars 4.25
to Dollars 5.05, giving it the highest state minimum wage in the US. Card
and Kreuger surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants before and after the change
both in New Jersey and in neighbouring eastern Pennsylvania where the
minimum wage had stayed at Dollars 4.25 an hour. The average starting wage
at fast-food restaurants in New Jersey increased by 10 per cent following
the rise in the minimum wage. By December 1992, full-time equivalent
employment had risen in New Jersey's fast-food restaurants, and fallen in
Pennsylvania. The biggest increases in employment occurred in those New
Jersey stores which were previously paying the lowest wages.
The US evidence is overwhelming: increasing minimum wages to a tolerable
level in low-wage labour markets does not cost jobs, and can even increase
employment. And a recent UK survey tells the same story about the UK wages
council rates. Until their abolition last year, the rates set for particular
wages councils declined steadily in real terms. But a study by Steve Machin
and Alan Manning of the London School of Economics found no evidence of
positive employment effects resulting from this decline. Instead, employment
declined in industries where wage council rates fell sharply.
One result of this growing evidence that minimum wages need not cost jobs
has been a softening of the attitude of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development. In its recent Unemployment report, the OECD
dropped its previous vigorous opposition to minimum wages, warning instead
that too high minimum rates will eventually bite into employment, and that
they cannot be the central plank of any anti-poverty strategy. Most families
living below the poverty line in developed countries are poor because of old
age, unemployment or children rather then low wages.
What is clear, in the modern labour markets, is that minimum wages can be an
effective part of a wider anti-poverty strategy to the extent that they make
the benefit systems work more effectively. The Clinton administration, still
reportedly considering an increase in the federal minimum, has placed more
stress on the Earned Income Tax Credit - a taxable credit to low-wage
working families with children. But, as this year's economic report of the
president argued, the minimum wage floor is necessary to prevent bad
employers from cutting wages and allowing the state to subsidise low pay.
In short, it does appear that a minimum wage can be an effective tool as
part of a broader anti-poverty strategy. Advocates of minimum wages are no
less vociferous than in the past.
But today they have more sophisticated arguments, and a wider body of
evidence, at their disposal.

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO HIKE BASE PAY TO $4.25 IN BILL DEFYING VETO THREAT

Defying threats of a second presidential veto, the Democratic-controlled House 
Education and Labor Committee Tuesday agreed to raise the federal minimum wage 
to $4.25 an hour on Jan. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted also to allow employers to pay a lower starting wage of 
$3.61 an hour for 60 days to newly hired employees with no previous experience 
in the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a plan by President Bush would not raise the current minimum wage 
of $3.35 an hour until 1992, although he also would raise it to $4.25. 
Additionally, his plan would allow employers in 1992 to pay newly hired workers 
$3.40 a hour for six months, whether or not they had previous job experience. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic-dominated House is expected to pass the bill next month, and a 
similar measure has been prepared for Senate approval before the start of the 
new fiscal year on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bush previously delivered an ultimatum to Congress, vowing to veto any minimum 
wage bill if the top rate exceeded $4.25 an hour and did not include his 
conditions for a starting wage. 
</P>
<P>
The President made good on his promise on June 13, rejecting a bill that raised 
the floor to $4.55 an hour and contained the 60-day starting wage provision. 
</P>
<P>
Because the average hourly pay for private non-farm workers was $9.70 an hour 
last July, the fight over the minimum wage may involve greater political 
symbolism than economic impact. California, for example, already has a $4.25 
minimum pay rate, and about a dozen other states have wage floors higher than 
the federal level. 
</P>
<P>
But partisan lines were clearly drawn on the issue, with intensive lobbying for 
the increase by organized labor and heavy opposition from the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce and other business groups. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the committee, noted that 
the Bush Administration has agreed to negotiate with Congress on clean air 
standards, drug policy and the federal budget, but not on an increase in the 
minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials have said that Bush's veto of a minimum wage of $4.55 
apparently inflicted little political damage. Rep. Austin J. Murphy (D-Pa.), a 
leading advocate of a minimum wage increase, said that he was informed Tuesday 
by Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole: "The President has no 
concessions."

President Bush on Friday signed a bill that will raise the minimum wage to 
$4.25 an hour from $3.35 by the spring of 1991, formally accepting the 
compromise that ended a year of disagreement with congressional Democrats and 
organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
Bush praised the measure, which he said would "protect jobs and put more money 
into the pockets of our workers." But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said it 
merely marked progress "to the 50-yard line" on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The increase, the first since 1981, would bring the wage to $4.25 an hour by 
April, 1991, after going to an intermediate $3.80 on April 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The new law includes a lower "training wage" for new workers who are 
teen-agers, a provision sought by Bush but initially opposed by congressional 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Bush in June vetoed a bill that would have increased the wage to $4.55 over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
At an Oval Office signing ceremony attended by congressional leaders and 
sponsors, Bush called the new act "a good example of what we can do in the 
future on other matters." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, told 
reporters: "It's not as much as the working poor deserve, but it was a real 
compromise and it brought the President's position to one of not saying take it 
or leave it." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said a Democratic-led effort to raise the wage further in 1992, a 
presidential election year, was "a live option." 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the new law, young people 16 to 19 years old who have never 
worked could be paid the training wage for 90 days. Employers with a training 
plan in place could pay the young workers a training rate for 90 days more. 
</P>
<P>
The training wage would be $3.35 an hour after next April 1. When the minimum 
wage increases to $4.25 a year later, the subminimum would increase to $3.61 an 
hour. The provision allowing for the subminimum expires in April, 1993, unless 
extended by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Among others at the signing ceremony were Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford 
Dole, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.)

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole told Congress on
Friday that President Bush will veto any attempt to raise the
minimum wage beyond the administration's goal of $4.25 an hour at
the end of three years, and unless the legislation includes a
``training wage'' for all newly hired workers.
   Mrs. Dole's blunt warning came as she formally presented the plan
to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, setting the
administration strongly against a plan by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and majority Democrats that would raise the hourly minimum
to $4.65.
   She contended the Democratic plan, similar to one that died under
opposition by then-President Reagan last year, would cost 650,000
jobs.
   Bush's plan would raise the $3.35 minimum wage, unchanged since
1981, by 30 cents an hour a year until it reaches $4.25 an hour in
1991. All new workers hired at the minimum could be paid $3.35 an
hour for the first six months of their employment.
   ``Any more expansive approach at this time would be unacceptable
because it would decrease job opportunities,'' Mrs. Dole said.
``Legislation outside these parameters would call for a veto.''
   Kennedy told Mrs. Dole he hoped that ``we're not getting hit with
a take it or leave it.''
   Mrs. Dole said bluntly, ``The president has signed up for $4.25
an hour. and not higher.
   ``$4.25 is it,'' she said, waving her hand.
   The Labor committee will consider the bill Kennedy introduced
with Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, who has said he wants a
floor debate and vote on the question by the end of the month.
   Under the ``training wage,'' all workers hired at the minimum
could be paid $3.35 an hour for six months before they are covered
by the higher standard. Kennedy and other key Democrats and
organized labor have opposed setting a lower standard for any
workers, which organized labor fears could cause companies to layoff
higher-paid workers in favor of those who can be paid less.
   Twelve states and the District of Columbia have raised the
minimum wage in laws that take precedence over the federal standard
inside their borders, according to the Labor Department. California
and Connecticut have the highest minimum at $4.25 an hour, although
D.C. has a $4.85 floor for some workers.
   The other states with minimums higher than the federal government
are Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

   Senate Democrats and the White House will
clash directly for the first time next week over raising the $3.35
hourly minimum wage, with more skirmishes expected before the
nation's 5 million lowest paid workers get an increase.
   Leaders of both parties in the Senate agreed Friday to hold
back-to-back votes Tuesday _ the first on the latest Democratic
version for annual increases of 40 cents an hour to $4.55 by
October 1991, and the second on Bush's offer of yearly 30-cent
boosts to $4.25 by January 1992.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole conceded his party and Bush are
likely to lose both votes. But Dole expressed confidence of a
victory when the president vetoes the measure, as he promised again
Friday, and Democrats attempt to override the veto.
   The chief sponsor of the raise, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
acknowledged he lacks the 16 additional votes needed to muster a
two-thirds majority for overriding a presidential veto.
   ``I would hope they don't again lay down this line in the
sand,'' Kennedy said, challenging the administration's insistence
on no more compromises. ``They've come a long way, we've come a
long way.''
   Democrats on Friday subtracted a dime from the $4.65 federal
floor on wages they had wanted, and they accepted for the first
time a 60-day subminimum ``training wage'' for workers entering
their first job.
   Bush, however, told reporters he had ``no intention of budging
one inch'' on allowing a minimum wage that high or on accepting
that short a period during which employers could pay a ``training
wage'' 20 percent below the federal floor.
   ``I will veto any bill which exceeds a $4.25 wage level and
which does not contain a six-month training wage for new hires,''
he said in a letter Friday to Dole.
   The latest Democratic plan was put together by Kennedy and Sens.
Bob Graham of Florida and David Pryor of Arkansas. Except for minor
differences on the subminimum scale, it is identical to a bill
passed by the House last month.
   In the House version, an employer could pay the lower subminimum
skill only to workers in their first job. The Senate measure would
require a worker to have at least 60 days' experience in one or
more jobs before any employer would have to pay the higher scale.
   Bush's subminimum would allow employers to continue paying $3.35
to any new hires, regardless of their previous experience, for six
months. That subminimum would rise to $3.40 an hour in 1992 under
the president's proposal while the Democrats would do away with it
entirely then.

<HEAD>Bush Adminstration Urges No Amendments; Final Vote Delayed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration urged Republican
senators Tuesday not to undermine a compromise to increase the
minimum wage by seeking to amend the deal.
   A final vote on the plan was delayed until Wednesday morning by
congressional action to increase the government's debt ceiling.
   Because of the delay, it was unclear whether several GOP senators
said to be mulling amendments would honor the administration's
request, delivered in a letter to the Senate from Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole.
   Mrs. Dole said the administration had supported the compromise
passed by the House last week and ``accordingly I ask for your
support of this same bill now before the Senate with no amendments
attached.''
   It appeared, however, that at least one amendment would be
offered, a proposal by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, to exempt small
businesses from the increase in the minimum wage. The amendment, if
offered, was expected to fail.
   Mrs. Dole's letter was addressed to her husband, Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. A copy was given to Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Talks on raising the debt limit dragged on throughout the day,
and Tuesday evening Mitchell announced the minimum-wage vote would
be Wednesday.
   The legislation, as it now stands, would increase the hourly
minimum wage from $3.35 to $3.80 next April 1 and to $4.25 a year
later. It also would create a new, subminimum ``training wage'' for
workers 16-19 years old new to the job market. All workers in that
age group could be paid the subminimum for their first three months,
and for another three months if enrolled in approved training
programs.
   The subminimum would be $3.35 when the minimum wage rose to
$3.80. It would rise to $3.61 when the minimum wage rose to $4.25.
The provision allowing the subminimum expires in 1993.

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Increase Clears Congress; Bush to Sign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only President Bush's promised signature is
needed for the first minimum wage increase in nearly a decade,
following Congress' lopsided approval of a bill raising the rate to
$4.25 by April 1991.
   The measure _ which includes a subminimum wage for teen-agers
new to the job market _ cleared the Senate on an 89-8 vote
Wednesday, exactly a week after it passed the House by an equally
overwhelming vote of 382-37.
   Bush, who struck the compromise plan with congressional
Democrats last week, is expected to sign the bill before
Thanksgiving, perhaps as early as next week.
   ``The nine-year logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken,''
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said after the Senate vote. ``The
working poor are about to receive an increase, although it is not
as much as they deserve.''
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, speaking for the Bush
administration, said ``the 3 million American workers currently on
the minimum wage will benefit.'' But she said skills training was
the best way to help the working poor and urged Congress to move
ahead with legislation dealing with that issue.
   ``The minimum wage is not the pulley to pull people out of
poverty,'' she said.
   The compromise plan will push the minimum wage, $3.35 an hour
since January 1981, to $3.80 on April 1 and to $4.25 a year later.
At the same time, it will create a new, lower wage for 16- to
19-year-old workers who are new to the job market.
   Democrats and organized labor long have opposed such a
subminimum ``training wage'' but were forced to concede that point
to Bush to strike the deal. In return, Bush agreed to have the
minimum wage reach $4.25 nine months earlier than he had proposed
and also accepted a far more restrictive training wage than he
sought earlier this year.
   Labor played down its concessions in calling on Bush to quickly
sign the measure into law.
   ``America's poorest workers have gone nearly a decade without a
raise and this long-overdue step will give them a chance to lift
themselves and their families out of poverty,'' AFL-CIO President
Lane Kirkland said.
   Even as they praised Bush for agreeing to the compromise,
Democrats said they would seek another increase heading into the
1992 presidential elections, when Bush likely will be seeking a
second term.
   Both sides made significant concessions to reach the compromise
four months after Bush vetoed an earlier Democratic minimum-wage
plan.
   In addition to agreeing to a subminimum, Democrats and labor
scaled back their final minimum-wage target; the measure Bush
vetoed called for an increase to $4.55 an hour.
   The White House, under increasing pressure from GOP lawmakers
seeking to avoid another veto battle heading into 1990 elections
year, agreed to a timetable reaching the $4.25 level nine months
before Bush had proposed.
   Bush also accepted a training wage that can only be paid to
workers 16 to 19 years old for their first three months of work
experience and for another three months if certified training is
provided. The provision allowing the subminimum expires in April
1993.
   Under the plan, the subminimum wage will be $3.35 on April 1 and
$3.61 a year later.
   Bush wanted to allow the lower wage to be paid to all workers,
regardless of age, for their first six months on any new job,
regardless of past work experience.
   All eight senators voting against the measure were Republicans.
They were Sens. William Armstrong of Colorado, Hatch and Jake Garn
of Utah, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire, Connie Mack of Florida, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, and
Steve Symms of Idaho. Three senators did not vote: Max Baucus,
D-Mont., Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.

   President Bush said today he had ``no

Senate Democrats moved forward with their plan to raise the base
wage higher than Bush has said he will support.
   It was the second veto threat from the president in as many
days, and Bush's clearest statement about the fate of the
Democrat-sponsored plan if it reached his desk.
   ``We fired our best shot and last shot and only shot first,''
Bush said at a meeting with reporters. ``I have no inention of
budging one inch on this. I have too much at stake.''
   That drew fire from one leading supporter of the Senate
Democrats' plan, as debate on it resumed today.
   ``Don't give us a take-it-or-leave-it proposal,'' said Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. ``That's the kind of administration
we've had the last eight years. Confrontation. Confrontation.
Confrontation.''
   Sponsors were hoping for a final vote today but were unable to
reach agreement with Republicans, meaning the debate likely will
extend into next week. Amendments lowering the final minimum wage
target to $4.55 from $4.65 and providing for a 60-day subminimum
wage for new workers were likely to be offered with the resumption
of debate today.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican floor leader, urged
Democrats to accept Bush's proposal as a compromise.
   ``President Bush has extended an opportunity to the Congress to
enact a minimum wage increase,'' Hatch said. ``In my opinion, it is
a worthy alternative to the proposal now before us.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. and chief sponsor of the Senate
bill, entered into a compromise with Southern Democrats over the
$4.55 top minimum that appears to give him more than enough votes
to win passage.
   Bush, however, appears to have the votes necessary to sustain a
veto.
   The amendments would bring the Senate bill in line with a
House-passed measure. Whether the bill would go straight to Bush
appears dependent on the Senate provisions for the subminimum. The
proposal being discussed late Thursday was slightly different from
what is in the House bill.
   The House-passed bill allows a subminimum to be paid to new
hires for two months but only if it was their first job. The
tentative Senate provision allows the subminimum to be paid to any
worker in that worker's first 60 days in the job market, regardless
of how many jobs the person held in that period. Both proposals
would abolish the subminimum in October 1992.
   Kennedy opened the debate by saying Bush's support for some
increase was a welcome change after the Reagan administration's
dogged opposition to any boost.
   ``Eight years of stonewalling against the minimum wage are
over,'' said Kennedy. Still, he said Bush's proposal ``gives too
little protection'' to the nation's low-wage workers.
   The minimum wage has been $3.35 since 1981.
   Both the House-passed bill and the amendments Kennedy promised
to support would raise the hourly minimum wage to $3.85 on Oct. 1,
to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year later.
   Bush's proposal calls for an increase to $3.65 on Jan. 1, 1990,
to $3.95 a year later and a final jump to $4.25 on Jan. 1, 1992.
The president's measure would allow employers to pay new workers
$3.35 an hour for their first six months. That subminimum would
rise to $3.40 an hour in 1992.

   The Senate opened debate Monday on the
compromise plan to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25, with a
leading Republican conceding the measure would pass easily but
warning it would cost jobs and fuel inflation.
   ``Every good and material that is sold in America is going to go
up in cost,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``I think that means
we're going to have some very difficult economic times in the
future. I hope I'm wrong.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., criticized Hatch's arguments
and called the planned increase from $3.35 to $4.25 by April 1991
``a very small adjustment'' that will leave minimum-wage earners
well behind inflation since the last increase in 1981.
   ``We have really, I think, failed in our compact with those
Americans who are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder,''
Kennedy said.
   ``Never in the half century of the minimum wage has this long a
period elapsed without an increase and may we do everything in our
power to make sure that the working poor never have to wait that
long again.''
   The House-passed proposal, which also would create a subminimum
``training wage'' for teen-agers, is the product of a deal struck a
week ago between President Bush and Congress' majority Democrats.
   Kennedy and Hatch were the only senators to speak on the issue
Monday, and whether a final vote will come Tuesday appeared to
hinge on whether Republicans and Democrats reached agreement on a
plan to raise the government's debt ceiling.
   Several Republicans are mulling amendments that could delay a
final vote on the minimum-wage bill indefinitely but an agreement
on the debt limit likely would lead to an agreement on a timetable
for debate on the wage bill as well.
   House and Senate leaders were meeting Monday night to discuss
the debt limit.
   The minimum-wage bill provides two 45-cent increases, one April
1 and the other a year later. It also allows employers to pay a
lower wage to workers ages 16 to 19 with fewer than three months
total job experience.
   The subminimum could be paid for three additional months if the
workers were in certified training programs. The subminimum would
be $3.35 beginning April 1 and rise to $3.61 April 1, 1991.
   The provision allowing the lower wage expires in 1993.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is heading toward a
confrontation with Senate Democrats over sharply differing plans to
raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage, with the possibility of the
first increase in eight years in the balance.
   ``$4.25 is it,'' Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole told Congress on
Friday, warning that President Bush would veto any attempt to fatten
the hourly increase that the administration would phase in over
three years.
   Mrs. Dole said the raise to $4.25 must also be coupled with a
sub-minimum ``training wage'' for the first six months employment
for all newly hired workers. And she would expand the current
exemption from the minimum to all small businesses.
   The Bush plan puts the administration at odds with Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, and his bill to gradually raise the minimum to $4.65 an
hour.
   There are slightly fewer than 4 million people working for the
minimum wage, according to the Labor Department.
   The $3.35 floor has not been raised since 1981. Since then, said
Kennedy, inflation has cut the purchasing power of that wage by 40
percent.
   The Labor committee will begin considering the minimum next week,
and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell says he would like to
bring it to a vote by the full Senate by the end of the month.
   But Mrs. Dole's veto warning on Friday _ what Kennedy termed a
``take it or leave it'' _ set the stage for a battle like the one
last year when Kennedy's increase failed because of opposition by
the Reagan administration.
   Mrs. Dole told the Labor panel that any rise in the minimum wage
will cost the nation jobs and that Kennedy's plan would mean 650,000
jobs lost. She said the administration's increase of 30 cents a year
for three years would balance lost jobs with higher earning power
for low-income workers.
   ``Any more expansive approach at this time would be unacceptable,
because it would decrease job opportunities,'' she told the
committee.
   ``Legislation outside those parameters would call for a veto,''
she said.
   Kennedy told Mrs. Dole that if a veto threat is part of the
administration's proposal ``then we're laying right out for a
confrontation ... I hope we're not getting a take or leave it.''
   Mrs. Dole answered, ``The president has signed up for $4.25 an
hour, and not higher.''
   ``$4.25 is it,'' she said, waving her hand.
   Under the ``training wage,'' all workers hired at the minimum
could be paid $3.35 an hour for six months before they are covered
by the higher standard, whether or not it is their first job. There
are no limits such as age on that exemption.
   The administration would also expand the tax credit for tips from
the current 40 percent to 50 percent.
   Kennedy, noting cost-of-living increases for government workers,
those in the military and others, said ``those at the end of the
economy ought to get it, too.''
   The administration proposal was attacked by the business
community after the committee hearing.
   ``A higher minimum wage would deny access to the first rung on
America's job ladder or those entering the work force _ the very
people the increase is meant to help,'' said Robert L. Martin,
director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's employee relations policy
center.

   The Democratic-controlled House Labor and
Education Comittee bowed Tuesday to President Bush's rejection of
anything more than a $4.25 minimum wage.
   But it coupled the 90-cent increase in the present $3.35-an-hour
wage floor with restrictions on the 80 percent subminimum ``training
wage'' that Bush is demanding _ a move that administration officials
say will prompt another veto.
   On a party-line voice vote, the committee approved a bill
identical to a measure Bush vetoed in June except that it provides
two hourly increases _ one this January and the other in January
1991 _ of 45 cents each. The vetoed bill had provided for three
annual increases to $4.55 an hour by Oct. 1, 1991.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole reiterated in a memo Bush's
promise to veto any bill which raises the current $3.35 floor to
$4.25 in less than three years or that establishes a subminimum
``training wage'' only for first-time job market entrants. Bush
would allow employers to pay an 80 percent subminimum to any newly
hired workers.
   The committee's chairman, Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif.,
said the reduction from the previous $4.55 wage floor that had been
sought was aimed at garnering support from Southern Democrats and
some Republicans for an override of another Bush veto.
   While both the House and Senate last year approved the $4.55
minimum wage with a 60-day subminimum training wage applicable only
to first-time workers, neither could muster the two-thirds majority
needed to override Bush's veto.
   ``There are some Republican members ready to change their votes
if the president doesn't'' show a willingness to compromise, Hawkins
said.
   Senate sources said the bill could be brought up there within the
next three weeks. Just before Congress recessed in August, the
Senate Labor Committee reapproved the same $4.55 minimum wage bill
that Bush vetoed, but with the understanding that it would likely be
modified on the Senate floor.
   Bush has demanded a six-month training wage compared to the
60-day subfloor Democrats are willing to allow. Both sides have
indicated a willingness to negotiate away differences in the time
span, but neither is budging on the applicability.
   Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., chairman of the House panel's labor
standards subcommittee, said Bush's proposal would allow employers
to pay a $3.40 subminimum wage perpetually by rotating new hires in
and out every 60 days to six months.
   ``I must say to the president, `Read my lips,''' Murphy said,
adopting Bush's campaign motto on higher taxes. ``No way will I
permit that man to sign a fake increase in the minimum wage for some
political purpose two years down the road.''

<HEAD>Senate Democrats Proposing to Expand Subminimum Wage for Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats offered Friday to expand
slightly an existing subminimum wage for full-time students to head
off what they called a ``hire 'em and fire 'em'' 90-day training
wage backed by Republicans.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., offered an amendment to his
bill raising the minimum wage from its current $3.35 an hour to
$4.55 an hour by 1991 that would allow employers to hire up to 12
students instead of the six now allowed for up to 20 hours a week
at 85 percent of the minimum wage.
   Only about 100,000 students are now earning the $2.85 subminimum
wage, according to Labor Department officials, compared with
515,000 students in 1978. Kennedy said his proposal would allow
employers to double the number of students at the subminimum wage
on their payrolls.
   The tactic was aimed at heading off a Republican amendment by
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah to establish an 80 percent training wage
for newly hired workers for up to 90 days.
   Hatch indicated that Republicans were unwilling to vote Friday
on Kennedy's student wage, putting off the key
Republican-Democratic showdown on the politically volatile minimum
wage issue until next week, eight weeks before the November
election.
   President Reagan, Vice President George Bush and Sen. Dan
Quayle, R-Ind., Bush's running mate, in the past have all
conditioned any increase in the minimum wage to a massive expansion
of the subminimum wage.
   Bush, campaigning in Ohio, refused again Friday to specify how
big of an increase in the minimum wage he favored.
   ``I don't know how much of an increase,'' he said, but repeated
that any upward adjustment should be coupled with a differential
for a lower training wage.
   Quayle, silent on the subject in recent days, offered an
amendment while the bill was still in the Senate Labor Committee in
June to couple a minimum wage increase to $4 an hour over two years
with a subminimum training wage. The amendment was never voted on.
   Kennedy complained none of the Republican training wage
proposals require employers to provide any training. He said the
real purpose was to give employers a ``windfall'' lower wage in
jobs that have turnover rates of up to 400 percent a year.
   ``Who honestly believes that it takes three months for someone
to learn to mop a floor or change the sheets on a bed?'' Kennedy
said. ``This is a pure and simple wage cut.''
   He said the Republican proposal would provide employers with a
powerful incentive to ``throw working families out on the street
once every 90 days'' and replace them with a new force of trainees.
   ``This is the hire 'em and fire 'em wage, maybe we can call it
the churn 'em and burn 'em wage,'' Kennedy said. ``The Bush push
will turn America's working people into vagabonds and gypsies,
thrown from job to job every three months. Can this be what George
Bush means when he talks about a kinder, gentler America?''
   Hatch called Kennedy's counterproposal for an expansion of the
currently allowed student waivers a ``not really very effective
bureaucratic way of doing things.''
   ``The purpose of the training wage is not to help full-time
students,'' Hatch said. ``The purpose is to open the door of
opportunity for those who have nothing, who are under-educated,
unskilled.''
   Hatch cited various studies estimating that increasing the
minimum wage would cause the loss of between 200,000 and 800,000
new jobs over the next three years.
   ``The reason 16 million new jobs _ 12 million of them at $10 an
hour or more _ have been created (since 1981) is because we haven't
had an increase in the minimum wage,'' he said.
   The federally mandated wage floor has been frozen at $3.35 since
January 1981, the longest time in its 50-year history without an
increase. Meanwhile, its purchasing power has dropped 30 percent to
$2.60 measured in today's dollars.
   Kennedy's bill would raise by 40-cent increments each year to
$3.75 in 1989, $4.15 in 1989 and $4.55 in 1990 _ a total of 35.8
percent over the three years. It also would increase the exemption
for small businesses from the current threshold of $362,000 in
gross sales to $500,000.
   According to Labor Department figures, about 6.7 million workers
were paid the minimum wage or less in 1986. But the bill also would
directly benefit 11.5 million other workers earning between $3.35
and $4.50.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex., said Friday that the House is
awaiting Senate action before considering the issue.
   ``The likelihood is we'll take it up, vote, pass it,'' he said.

   Republicans and conservative Democrats who
sustained President Bush's veto of an increase in the minimum wage
are pushing the White House to compromise on a scaled-back version
of the bill.
   Administration officials, however, are sending mixed signals,
floating possible concessions one day but insisting the next that
Bush won't budge from last spring's ``best, first and only offer.''
   Compromise or not, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., said Thursday that a bill raising the wage floor to $4.25
from the $3.35 level where it's been since 1981 will be voted on
Wednesday.
   Bush vetoed a bill in June that would have increased the minimum
wage to $4.55 an hour and established a subminimum training wage of
$3.35 for the first 60 days of a first-time worker's employment.
   He vowed to do the same again on any subsequent attempt that
goes higher than $4.25 an hour, hits that level before 1992 or
provides for less than a six-month subminimum scale for any new
hires, regardless of previous job experience.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., and GOP leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois on
Thursday that Bush wouldn't budge.
   ``We didn't reach agreement on anything,'' Foley told reporters
after the White House meeting.
   Michel held out hope ``there may be room for some bending.''
   ``The president will have to bend a little bit'' to avoid a veto
fight, he said. ``I don't think the president would enjoy vetoing a
second minimum wage bill.''
   Senate Republicans, led by Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
and Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, also have been urging the
White House to compromise.
   However, lawmakers and lobbyists on both sides said the White
House didn't begin focusing on the issue until late last week and
is scrambling for a way to prevent its allies from jumping to the
other side.
   ``They want to come in at the last minute and make a deal, but
there's no firm decision on what they want,'' said Rep. Timothy J.
Penny of Minnesota, one of 28 Democrats who voted last summer to
sustain Bush's veto.
   Sununu, according to congressional sources and lobbyists,
earlier this week floated as a possible compromise gradually
increasing the wage floor to $4.25 an hour by July 1991 _ six
months earlier than Bush wanted _ with a three-month subminimum for
new hires. But it was not put forth Thursday.
   ``They're floundering all over the place,'' said Robert
McGlotten, the AFL-CIO's chief lobbyist. ``They keep talking like
they want to make some movement. But when we sit down with them, we
get nowhere.''
   A strategist for a business group opposed to any increase
agreed. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, he said
administration officials this week presented one possible training
wage compromise ``that was so convoluted and complicated that it
could never be used.''
   McGlotten said ``there's no give'' by unions on the issue of
achieving a 90-cent increase to $4.25 an hour by January 1991, but
he expressed a willingness to negotiate the training wage issue as
long as employers are prevented from using it as a perpetual source
of below minimum-scale labor.
   Whatever the outcome, liberal Democrats and supporters of Bush's
earlier veto agree that minimum wage supporters have the upper hand.
   Democrats want to have a bill approved by both the House and
Senate and on Bush's desk before the Nov. 13 arrival in Washington
of Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, believing his visit will
make a veto more difficult.
   ``There is a lot of nervousness on the part of the White House
that they could look like a mean old ogre, fighting day and night
to get a capital gains tax break while also fighting equally hard
against raising the minimum wage,'' Penny said.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said supporters still lack a
two-thirds, veto-proof majority for the new bill, which would raise
the wage floor to $3.80 in January and to $4.25 by January 1991
with a 60-day training wage only for first-time workers.
   ``But we're gaining ground,'' Bonior said.

   The House Labor Committee approved a measure that raises the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour over two years and that sets a 60-day subminimum training wage for employees with less than two month's working experience. 

   Last June, the president vetoed a bill that would have increased the minimum wage to $4.55 an hour over three years and set a 60-day subminimum training wage for first-time workers. 

   President Bush has insisted he will veto legislation that sets the wage floor higher than $4.25 an hour over three years. 
He also says the measure must permit new employees in minimum-wage jobs to be paid a training wage for six months. 
The Democratic sponsors of the new measure say they compromised by limiting the increase to $4.25, but that they refuse to compromise further on the training wage. 

   In a statement yesterday, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole reiterated Mr. Bush's promise to veto any bill that raises the minimum wage to more than $4.25 an hour in less than three years or that establishes a training wage for less than six months. 

   The bill approved yesterday by voice vote would increase the minimum wage by 45 cents in January 1990 and another 45 cents in January 1991. 
The minimum wage has been $3.35 an hour since 1981. 

   The full House is expected to consider the measure within two weeks. 
Although the bill is expected to pass, congressional aides say it's uncertain whether it will attract the two-thirds vote needed to override a veto. 
In August, the Senate Labor Committee passed the same bill the president vetoed last June, but Senate Democrats are expected to modify the measure when it's considered on the floor.

<HEAD>Administration Says Minimum Wage Increase Could Cost 850,000 Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House has entered the congressional
fray over a proposed increase in the minimum wage, arguing that it
could cost 850,000 jobs while adding to the budget deficit.
   Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisors, says even the smallest increase under
consideration, raising the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.65 per
hour by 1992, would cost 600,000 jobs.
   Those losses ``would be concentrated among younger, less skilled
and minority workers,'' he said.
   A chart supplied by Sprinkel indicates an increase in the
minimum wage to $5.05 an hour over four years would eliminate
850,000 jobs by 1992.
   Legislation to raise the minimum wage $4.65 by 1991 was
introduced last year, but the House Education and Labor Committee
raised the figure to $5.05 per hour over four years. The original
bill proposed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., is pending in the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, which Kennedy chairs.
   ``Increasing the minimum wage would have adverse effects on
employment, unemployment, economic output and on the budget
deficit,'' Sprinkel said in a letter to Rep. Thomas E. Petri,
R-Wisc., a committee member.
   ``Increasing the federal minimum wage would do little to help
the working poor; under 20 percent of minimum wage workers are poor
and many would lose employment,'' Sprinkel wrote in the letter,
released Wednesday. ``The direct impact on the budget deficit would
be about $2 billion, due to both increased budget outlays and
reduced revenues.''
   He also said consumers would have to absorb roughly $13 billion
more in higher costs for the products that minimum-wage workers
help to produce.
   Democrats have argued that a minimum wage would have a minimal
effect on unemployment and the economy, and Kennedy denounced
Sprinkel's findings in a statement released Wednesday night.
   ``That's preposterous,'' he said. ``The president could have
obtained a more reliable estimate of the job effect from Joan
Quigley,'' the San Francisco astrologer contacted by Nancy Reagan
for advice..
   Petri sought Sprinkel's assessment of the minimum wage
legislation after charging that the Democratic leadership had
attempted to suppress a Congressional Budget Office report that
said an increase to $5.05 an hour will cost up to 500,000 jobs.
   The draft study was sent to House labor Chairman Augustus
Hawkins, D-Calif., who returned it to the CBO, asking only the
costs of the bill and not its economic impact.
   House Republicans charged that the CBO ``deliberately censored
information pertinent to consideration of the bill or was
specifically instructed to do so and followed that instruction,''
according to a letter from House Minority Leader Robert Michel,
D-Ill.
   Sprinkel said an earned income tax credit (EITC), an alternative
proposed by Petri but rejected by the House labor committee, would
target assistance to families of the working poor more directly
than an increase in the minimum wage.
   Petri plans to place his proposal for a wage supplement which
would base the credit on family size before the full House when the
legislation reaches the floor.
   ``Without the same adverse effects on the economy, and with

increased income to working heads of larger families below or close
to poverty level,'' said Sprinkel.

<HEAD>House Passage Sends Minimum Wage Compromise to Senate</HEAD>

   Senate leaders are promising to pass the first
raise in the minimum wage in nearly a decade before Thanksgiving
following a lopsided House vote for the compromise increase.
   The House voted 382-37 on Wednesday to raise the minimum wage
from $3.35 _ its level since January 1981 _ to $3.80 next April 1
and $4.25 a year later.
   A vote in the Senate, where the measure has overwhelming
support, has not been scheduled but could come as early as next
week. Senate passage would send the measure to President Bush,
whose compromise with Congress Tuesday ends an eight-year political
fight between congressional Democrats and two Republican
administrations.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine called the
compromise ``a victory for working Americans, those at the bottom
of the economic scale, who need a boost and need it as soon as
possible.''
   House Democrats who had failed in years past to raise the
minimum wage said their victory was tempered by an increase smaller
than they had passed earlier this year and by the new subminimum
wage for teen-agers new to the job market.
   ``This vote represents only a partial victory for low-wage
workers,'' Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., said after the House
endorsed the compromise. ``However, something is better than
nothing. ... We should never again allow a decade to elapse with no
action.''
   The lower minimum could be paid to workers from 16 to 19 years
old for their first three months of work experience. It could be
extended for three more months for youths in certified training
programs.
   The lower wage would be 85 percent of the prevailing minimum
wage except for in the first year of the increase, when it would be
barred from being below the current $3.35 an hour minimum. The
subminimum would be $3.61 when the minimum wage rose to $4.25.
   The provision allowing the lower wage expires in April 1993.
   The government says some 4 million Americans work at the minimum
wage. Congressional researchers say two-thirds of them are women
and between 25 percent and 33 percent are heads of households.
   Eleven states have laws mandating minimum wages higher than the
current federal floor; a few of them already are at the $4.25 level.
   Despite the lopsided vote, lawmakers from both parties found
fault with the compromise.
   Democrats complained the increase was too small and the
subminimum created a dangerous two-tiered wage system. Some
conservative Republicans opposed any increase and said Congress was
intruding on business costs.
   But the fierce partisanship that characterized the fight over a
bill Bush vetoed last summer was absent.
   ``We could have let politics override our effort to reach an
agreement on minimum wage,'' said Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., who had
urged the White House to drop its refusal to compromise. ``That
political debate is behind us.''
   Voting for the compromise were 247 Democrats and 135
Republicans. Two Democrats who support a higher minimum wage, Carl
Perkins of Kentucky and George Miller of California, voted no
because they oppose the subminimum. Thirty-five Republicans voted
against the measure.
   To strike the deal, Democrats agreed to push back the effective
dates of the increases from January to April, accept the subminimum
wage and drop their insistence on a commission to make annual
recommendations on the wage level, a mechanism Republicans said
would have been used to seek annual increases.
   Bush, in what the administration insisted until Friday was his
``first, best and final offer,'' earlier this year offered an
increase to $4.25 and a six-month lower minimum for new workers
regardless of previous experience. He agreed to the increase nine
months earlier than he had proposed and accepted a far more
restrictive subminimum wage.

   House Republicans and conservative Democrats
who sustained President Bush's veto in June of a minimum wage
increase struggled Thursday to find a compromise that would avoid
another showdown next week.
   But the White House, in a meeting with leaders of the two
parties, refused to budge on Bush's demand for a six-month
subminimum training wage and labor leaders balked at accepting
anything less than a $4.25 minimum wage by January 1991.
   Whether a compromise is reached or not, Democratic leaders plan
to bring to the House floor next Wednesday a scaled-back $4.25
version of the bill that Bush vetoed, which would have set a
$4.55-an-hour minimum wage with a 60-day subminimum training wage.
   Key players in both parties and lobbyists for business and labor
groups said the White House has been sending signals since late
last week that Bush wanted to avoid a showdown and was open to
negotiating a deal.
   ``There is a lot of nervousness on the part of the White House
that they could look like a mean old ogre here fighting day and
night to get a capital gains tax break while also fighting equally
hard against raising the minimum wage,'' said Rep. Timothy J.
Penny, D-Minn.
   ``They want to come in at the last minute and make a deal but
there's no firm decision on what they want,'' said Penny, one of 28
Democrats who voted last summer to sustain Bush's veto.
   Despite pleas from Democrats like Penny and several Republicans,
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., and GOP leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois that
Bush would not yield.
   ``We didn't reach agreement on anything,'' Foley told reporters
after the White House meeting.
   Bush, in what he called a ``best and only offer,'' promised
shortly after taking office to veto any bill that would raise the
minimum wage above $4.25 an hour or that reached that level before
Jan. 1, 1992.
   Coupled with any increase, he said, must be a six-month
subminimum training wage that would maintain the current wage floor
of $3.35 an hour for newly hired workers, regardless of their
experience.
   Sununu, according to congressional sources and lobbyists,
``floated'' as a possible compromise gradually increasing the wage
floor to $4.25 an hour by July 1991 _ six months earlier than Bush
wanted _ with a three-month subminimum for new hires.
   But that offer was not put forth Thursday, Foley and Michel said.
   ``The president will have to bend a little bit'' to avoid a veto
fight, Michel said, ``and there may be room for some bending. I
don't think the president would enjoy vetoing a second minimum wage
bill.''
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said supporters still lack a
two-thirds, veto-proof majority for a new bill that would raise the
wage floor to $3.80 this January and to $4.25 by January 1991 with
a 60-day training wage only for first-time workers.
   ``But we're gaining ground,'' he said. ``Our whip count from
Republicans and conservative Democrats is much better than it was
the last vote.''
   Democrats want to have a bill approved by both the House and
Senate and on Bush's desk before the Nov. 13 arrival in Washington
of Polish Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa, believing the
occasion will make a veto more difficult politically.
   ``We want to get it to him and give him an opportunity to think
about it,'' said Bonior. ``The priorities of this administration in
terms of economic justice for people are nowhere near reality.''
   Robert McGlotten, the AFL-CIO's chief lobbyist, expressed a
willingness to negotiate the training wage issue as long as there
are assurances that employers cannot use it to rotate workers in
and out of entry-level jobs so that they never rise above the
subminimum level.
   ``They keep talking like they want to make some movement,'' he
said of the administration, ``but when we sit down with them, we
get nowhere. They're floundering all over the place.''
   McGlotten said ``there's no give'' by unions on the issue of
achieving a 90-cent increase to $4.25 an hour by January 1991.

<HEAD>Administration to Present Minimum Wage Hike Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials say Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole will outline a proposal to raise the
minimum wage to $4.25 an hour over three years and create an hourly
`'training wage'' of $3.35 at a Senate hearing today.
   The plan is to be presented before the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, whose chairman Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
has introduced legislation calling for a hike in the minimum wage to
$4.55 to be accompanied by automatic periodic increases in the
future.
   Mrs. Dole's testimony is expected to set the stage for a renewed
battle between the administration and congressional Democrats who
opposed the training wage last year as a sub-minimum wage that
organized labor says might threaten the jobs of higher paid workers.
   The minimum hourly wage has been set at $3.35 since 1981. A
minimum wage increase to $4.25 by 1991 would represent a 27 percent
increase over that rate.
   ``She will make the case that this is a proposal that fulfills
President Bush's campaign pledge to raise the minimum wage but
recognizes that any increase means a loss in job opportunities,''
said one administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``That's why the increase is more modest'' than the increase
proposed last year by Kennedy, D-Mass., said the official. ``And
that's why the training wage is there as well, to try to offset any
unemployment.''
   The official said the details of the administration position,
which would create a training wage to allow businesses to pay newly
hired employees $3.35 an hour for the first six months of employment
before facing a requirement to raise their pay to the full minimum,
were completed late Thursday afternoon.
   The plan also would expand an exemption from the $ 3.35 floor
that currently applys only to some small businesses in the retail
and service industries to all small businesses whose annual earnings
remain under a specified level.
   Bush has repeatedly linked a raise in the minimum wage to a
training wage, and Mrs. Dole said in her confirmation hearing that
she would support adding language to any legislation to prevent
employers from cutting their costs by hiring people at the training
wage and laying off higher paid workers.

   The House Labor Committee approved a bill that would boost the minimum wage to $5.05 an hour over the next four years. 

   The committee backed the measure by a voice vote, after rejecting several Republican-sponsored amendments aimed at weakening the effect of the increases, or otherwise giving employers a wage-cost break. 

   Under the legislation, the hourly minimum wage, which has stood at $3.35 since 1981, would rise to $3.85 next year, $4.25 in 1990, $4.65 in 1991, and $5.05 in 1992. 
A bill to raise the wage floor also is pending in the Senate. 

   Robert McGlotten, the AFL-CIO legislative director, said the committee "recognized the need to bring this nation's 'working poor' to at least the poverty level by gradually raising the minimum wage." 

   But Robert Martin, human resources manager for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said a study the Chamber sponsored shows that the first three years of increases alone would cost 550,000 jobs at companies that cannot afford the higher wage, and the additional, fourth-year rise "adds insult to injury." 

   "I kind of shudder at what the reaction of the small-business community will be," he added. 

   The bill is expected to be considered by the full House next month. 
The measure before the Senate Labor Committee would raise the hourly minimum to $4.65 after three years, and after that, tie the wage floor to the average wage paid to manufacturing workers nationwide. 

   The House bill was amended last week by a Labor subcommittee, which killed the manufacturing-wage indexing provision and, partly in compensation, added the increase to $5.05 an hour in the fourth year. 

   The minimum wage legislation is an important part of a legislative push by unions and other employee groups to improve workers' pay, benefits and working conditions; many of the measures had been stalled in Congress through most of the years of the Reagan administration. 
The administration opposes the wage floor bill, but didn't take an active role in fighting the House committee action. 

   The proposed amendments turned aside yesterday by the House committee were rejected mostly along party lines. 
An amendment offered by Steve Bartlett (R., Texas) would have kept the minimum wage at $3.35 an hour for the first 90 days of work by newly hired employees; it was rejected, 20-13. 

   That "for-hire" provision was a version of other plans for keeping the minimum wage low for workers with the least experience. 
Administration and other critics of wage-floor increases say such a low wage is necessary to encourage employers to take on new, untrained workers. 
The idea had been called a "youth subminimum wage" but, more recently, its backers have used terms like "youth opportunity wage" or "training wage." 

   Other amendments, rejected by voice votes, would have: expanded an existing option for employers to give certain workers compensatory time off for working overtime, rather than requiring them to pay employees at 1.5 times their basic wage; included fringe benefits in calculating payment of the minimum wage; and exempted motorcycle dealers from the wage floor.

<TEXT>
   Democrats, renewing a fight with President Bush
they have already lost once this year, are trying to increase the
minimum wage without the lower pay scale for all new workers that
Republicans are demanding.
   On a party-line voice vote Tuesday, the Democratic-controlled
House Education and Labor Committee bowed to Bush's demand for an
increase only to $4.25. But the bill would raise the minimum wage in
two years instead of three and would set a subminimum wage only for
first-time workers.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole repeated Bush's vow to again veto
any bill which raises federal wage floor to $4.25 in less than three
years or that does not set a lower floor for six months for
newly-hired workers.
   Bush vetoed a bill in June that called for three annual increases
to $4.55 an hour by Oct. 1, 1991.
   The new bill would provide annual increases of 45 cents in
January and again in January 1991 in the current minimum wage, which
has been $3.35 since 1981.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., said
the previous target was being reduced by 30 cents to gain support
from southern Democrats and some Republicans for another expected
attempt to override Bush's veto.
   ``There are some Republican members ready to change their votes
if the president doesn't'' compromise, Hawkins said.
   Senate sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bill
could be brought up there within the next three weeks. Just before
Congress recessed in August, the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee again approved the same $4.55 minimum wage bill Bush had
vetoed, although senators said it would likely be modified on the
Senate floor.
   Bush, like former President Ronald Reagan, has insisted on
establishing a subminimum floor that would allow employers to pay
any newly hired worker 20 percent less for up to six months,
regardless of the worker's previous job experience.
   Democrats and unions who had bitterly opposed such a subminimum,
agreed for the first time earlier this year to a ``training wage''
but only for 60 days and only for first-time entrants in the job
market.
   Both Republicans and Democrats indicated a willingness Tuesday to
negotiate over their differences on the duration of the subminimum
period, but neither side is budging on who the lower floor applies
to.
   Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., said Bush's proposal would allow
employers to pay a $3.40 subminimum wage perpetually by rotating new
hires in and out every 60 days to six months.

   The author of the Senate-passed bill to raise
the minimum wage says President Bush runs a high political risk
with voters by vetoing the measure, while Republicans say the
president must prove his ability to stand firm.
   ``I hope we still can reach agreement with the president,'' Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy said Wednesday night after his proposal to raise
the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 by October 1991 cleared
the Senate on a 62-37 vote.
   ``If that's not the case, we'll see the president and those who
support the president's position at the polls,'' said Kennedy,
D-Mass.
   There are some differences between the Kennedy bill and
legislation already passed by the House. A conference committee was
expected to be named today to draft a compromise.
   Kennedy, without being specific, said he was open to compromise
with the White House during the conference stage. But the prospects
for such an overture from Bush appear highly unlikely. Bush
repeatedly has said his proposal to raise the minimum wage to $4.25
by January 1992, rejected in both the House and the Senate, was his
last.
   ``I have it on pretty good authority that it's not going to be
higher than $4.25,'' said Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole,
husband of Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   The final bill could be considered as early as next week,
although no timetable has been set. The Democratic leadership has
the votes to win final passage, but Bush appears to have more than
enough votes to sustain a veto.
   Ten Republicans joined 52 Democrats in supporting the Senate
bill, while two Democrats and 35 Republicans voted against it. The
only senator not voting was Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.
   A renewed campaign to get the president to change his mind began
just after the vote.
   ``I urge the president to sign it when it reaches his desk,''
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said in a statement. ``A veto would
only compound the inequities faced by America's lowest-paid workers
who have gone eight years without a pay raise.''
   But Republicans, noting a number of other Democrat-sponsored
domestic programs likely to emerge from Congress over GOP
objections, said it was time for Bush to prove he will stand his
ground.
   ``Everyone knows the whole ballgame rests on the presidential
veto,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. He said few presidents have
had to control Congress through repeated vetoes but added, ``I
suspect this president is going to have to do that.''
   Under the Democrats' plan, the minimum wage, frozen at $3.35
since 1981, would rise to $3.85 on Oct.1, to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990,
and to $4.55 a year later.
   Bush has said he would veto any bill to raise the minimum wage
to more than $4.25 an hour and has insisted legislation must also
allow employers to pay all new workers a subminimum wage for up to
six months.
   Republicans argue the ``training wage'' is necessary to prevent
massive job losses they contend would be caused by the higher
minimum wage. Democrats have disputed the job-loss predictions, but
included in their measures a provision allowing employers to pay
some new workers a lower scale for up to two months.

   Senate leaders today urged colleagues to stop
using delaying tactics preventing final passage of a compromise
plan to raise the hourly minimum wage to $4.25.
   Both Majority Leader George Mitchell and Republican leader Bob
Dole called on any senators who plan to offer amendments to the
proposal to come forward. A few senators have indicated they might
propose amendments, and debate has been all but stopped because
none has actually done so.
   Dole and Mitchell said they hoped a final vote on the minimum
wage could come today so the Senate could concentrate on
negotiations to raise the government's debt ceiling.
   The possible amendments range from an attempt to revive
President Bush's call for a capital gains tax cut to technical
changes in the minimum-wage bill. Most are considered little more
than attempts to delay final passage of the measure because of
partisan disputes, particularly those over capital gains and
efforts to raise the government's debt limit.
   ``This is, of course, a situation with which we in the Senate
have become all too familiar,'' Mitchell, D-Maine, said of the
delay.
   ``It is important we finish minimum wage, get some agreement to
vote,'' said Dole, R-Kan.
   The minimum-wage bill was among several President Bush mentioned
at a morning news conference at which he said Congress was moving
too slowly on his domestic agenda. ``I urge the Congress to move
quickly on these proposals,'' Bush said.
   Senate debate began Monday and only two senators spoke despite
Mitchell's urging that any senators with amendments step forward.
   During that debate, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., praised
Bush for compromising with Congress on the minimum wage. Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, predicted easy passage of the measure but said it
would hurt the economy.
   ``The nine-year stalemate over the minimum wage is finally
broken,'' said Kennedy. ``We certainly welcome that change of
attitude between the Reagan administration and the Bush
administration.''
   The increase would be the first since the federal wage floor hit
$3.35 in 1981.
   Hatch said the increase would not help many working poor but
would cause wage and price inflation.
   ``Every good and material that is sold in America is going to go
up in cost,'' Hatch said. ``I think that means we're going to have
some very difficult economic times in the future. I hope I'm
wrong.''
   Kennedy countered by calling the planned increase ``a very small
adjustment'' that still would leave minimum-wage earners well
behind price inflation since the last increase in 1981.
   ``May we do everything in our power to make sure that the
working poor never have to wait that long again,'' Kennedy said.
   The proposal, which also would create a subminimum for
teen-agers, is the product of a deal struck a week ago between Bush
and congressional Democrats.
   The measure provides two 45-cent increases, one next April 1 and
the other a year later.
   It also allows employers to pay a lower wage to workers age 16
to 19 with less than three months total job experience. The
subminimum could be paid for three additional months if the workers
were in certified training programs. The subminimum would be $3.35
beginning next April 1 and rise to $3.61 on April 1, 1991. The
provision allowing the lower wage expires in 1993.
