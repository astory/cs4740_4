LOW-FLUSH TOILET MODELS ARE DISPLAYED

In parched Ventura County, it just may be that the ultra-low flush toilet, 
which uses 1.6 gallons or less of water per flush, has replaced real estate as 
the favorite topic of cocktail-party conversation. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent forum sponsored by the Ventura County Water Conservation Program, 
Etablissements Porcher, a French manufacturer, even introduced an ultra-low 
flush toilet for the status-minded. 
</P>
<P>
Called the Veneto, the unit "flushes efficiently on only 1 1/2 gallons" and 
"can save a family of four 25,000 gallons of water a year," according to the 
company's sales brochure. 
</P>
<P>
A Veneto model on display came in coraline, a salmon-like hue, and had 
gold-plated brass fittings. 
</P>
<P>
The price: $1,000, plus installation. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 18 models of water-stingy toilets, ranging in retail price from about 
$100 upward, were on display in the Camarillo Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers all claimed that the units will satisfy the Ventura city 
rationing law that requires residents to install ultra-low flush toilets and 
other water-saving devices before they can apply for increased allotments. 
Above-average-size families and homes with toilets using 3.5 gallons or less 
per flush may be exempted from the retrofitting requirement at the May 7 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts agree that the toilet is the No. 1 water user in U.S. homes -- 
accounting for at least 25% of most families' usage. In contrast to the 
ultra-low flush units, which were introduced in Sweden in 1973, the vast 
majority of American toilets use from 3 to 7 gallons per flush. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy L. Corpening, a plumbing industry consultant, told about 150 local 
officials, plumbing contractors and others that about 1 million ultra-low flush 
toilets have been installed in U.S. bathrooms. This year, she said, U.S. 
manufacturers are expected to produce 2.4 million more. 
</P>
<P>
There are two basic ultra-low flush systems: gravity feed, a redesigned version 
of the conventional toilet, and the turbo type, which combines air and water 
pressure and is usually activated by pressing a button on the tank lid. The 
turbo types tend to be noisier and more expensive, but they're more effective 
than gravity units. 
</P>
<P>
One audience member at the Camarillo forum, Andy Lyskin, of Vic's Plumbing 
Supply Co. in Ventura, suggested that the city of Ventura should offer rebates 
to residents replacing older toilets, as the cities of Los Angeles and Santa 
Monica have done. 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the audience noted that a tank dam, a plastic object to 
reduce the amount of water flowing into a toilet tank, costs only about $6.95. 
"They don't always work, but they're better than nothing," a panelist said. 
</P>
<P>
And, at no cost at all, Ventura city residents can fill plastic bags with water 
and put them in toilet tanks. City spokeswoman Carol Green said Friday that 
"boxes and boxes" of the free bags have been given away at City Hall. The city 
has also given away at least 6,000 low-flow shower heads, she said. JACK

<DESCRIPT>  PALO-ALTO; RECYCLE; PROGRAM  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Old toilets never die. They just fade away into something else, at least in
Palo Alto.;   The city that already recycles just about everything has come up
with a program to recycle worn-out, obsolete commodes.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  PALO ALTO RECYCLES EVERYTHING, INCLUDING OLD
TOILETS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Rather than piling up at the city landfill, the old toilets will be hauled
away by a recycler, then crushed. The bits and pieces of porcelain later will
be mixed with asphalt to help form future highways and roads.;   "Yes, what
you once sat on, you could soon be driving on," quipped Debbie Katz, the
city's energy services manager.;   In all seriousness, though, the recycling
program does serve an important purpose: It means that old, water-wasting
toilets won't be resold and used again.;   It's all part of the city's new
water conservation incentives program. The effort also includes 50 percent
rebates to residents who replace old water-guzzling toilets with new ultra
low-flush models.;   The toilet rebate, which began this month, is the first
of its kind in the Bay Area, Katz said. Palo Alto officials hope the pilot
program, modeled after one in Santa Monica, will inspire other cities to
follow suit.;   Residents as well as owners of small businesses and
restaurants who switch to the ultra low-flush toilets after Oct. 1 can receive
a rebate for half the cost of the new toilet, up to $75.;   Ultra low-flush
toilets, some of which incorporate air to increase water pressure, use just
1.6 gallons of water per flush, compared with low-flush toilets that use about
3.5 gallons per flush and older toilets that can use 7 gallons or more.;  
"People may see 1.6 gallons and think, 'Gross! How's anything going to go
down,' " Katz said. "But these toilets are really efficient now.";  
Corporations also can benefit. Big businesses that replace their toilets or
modify cooling processes to save a minimum of 74,800 gallons of water a year
will be eligible for a minimum rebate of $100.;   If the incentives program
proves successful, it may be expanded later in the year to include ultra
low-flow shower heads, Katz said.;   City officials hope the new $150,000
incentives program will result in a savings of about 101 million gallons of
water a year, enough to serve about 310 average families for a year, Katz
said. One-third of the funds for incentives has been set aside to pay for
about 500 toilet rebates.;   The program also will help Palo Alto continue to
meet its water consumption limit. So far, the city has been doing well. At the
end of September, it was using 40 percent less water than in 1987 or 18
percent less than the limit set by the San Francisco Water Department, which
supplies all of the city's water.;   "We think there's a gigantic market for
these rebates," Katz said. "And we think it will put a good dent in our water
use.";   IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; To receive a rebate application packet, list of
approved ultra low-flush toilets and plumbing permit, call the Palo Alto
Utilities Department at (415) 329-2241.  </TEXT>

LOW-WATER TOILETS: 1.6-GALLON ANSWER TO CALIFORNIA'S DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Californians must look to their bathrooms for drought relief. 
</P>
<P>
This was clearly established by the recent decision by the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power to pay consumer rebates to people who install 
water-stingy toilets. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I were already considering buying what the plumbing industry calls 
a low-flush toilet when our old toilet forced our hand. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, it was one of those episodes that happens just when the entire 
household is trying to leave for work. The toilet, an older model that probably 
required 5 to 7 gallons per flush, gave up the ghost. 
</P>
<P>
Buying time through furious use of a plunger and drain-clearance chemicals, I 
set out to hurriedly investigate replacement. And in doing so, I found that 
what seemed like a comparatively simple home-maintenance task was a consumer 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
As plumbing fixture manufacturers have discovered, the market is now crowded 
with low-flush toilets, a line of products that virtually didn't exist five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city officials responsible for enforcing ordinances mandating use 
of water-stingy fixtures say there may be two dozen brands on the market. 
</P>
<P>
They illustrate the evolution of water conservation concerns in plumbing 
design. Thirty years ago, toilets required seven gallons to flush. Then, 
5-gallon models were introduced. Within the last decade, 3.5-gallon toilets -- 
now misleadingly called "water-saver" models -- appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last five years, the standard has dropped to 1.6 gallons -- even as 
little as one gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure on manufacturers to develop low-flush toilets has intensified in the 
last year with introduction of legislation -- now pending in Congress -- that 
would mandate that only toilets requiring 1.6 gallons or less per flush be used 
in new construction or sold as replacements. 
</P>
<P>
The federal toilet bill is held up in the House and Senate, where action isn't 
likely before later this year, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
But several cities and states have passed laws mandating 1.6-gallon flushing. 
The California drought illustrates why the rush to codify has occurred. Another 
dry spell in the East as severe as 1988's would probably hasten a federal 
mandate, congressional observers believe. 
</P>
<P>
Yet these developments don't address the consumer's first and vital question: 
Away from the testing laboratory and advertising agency photo studio and 
installed in your home, will a toilet that flushes with just 1.6 gallons of 
water really work? 
</P>
<P>
Since we finished our frantic consumer research and had our new toilet 
installed in early January -- an Eljer high-pressure model that uses 1.4 
gallons per flush -- it has never required a second flush to clear the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But in arriving at this point we encountered divisions of opinion and 
conflicting advice. 
</P>
<P>
First, the plumber we use warned that low-flush toilets may not introduce 
enough water into drain lines to propel wastes to the sewer quickly enough. 
This, in turn, could eventually result in clogs in the drain line leading 
across the yard and to the sewer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the plumber said, three or four brands of low-flush toilets he had 
installed right after they were first introduced simply didn't function as 
advertised. Customers who bought them insisted that they be ripped out. 
</P>
<P>
For people who rely on septic tanks, he said, the low-flush water amounts could 
inhibit the natural degrading of wastes by not introducing enough water into 
the septic tank and leech fields. 
</P>
<P>
These concerns had also attracted the attention of the plumbing industry. In 
turn, the American Society of Plumbing Engineers organized a study, retaining 
Alfred Steele, a noted Florida-based engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns over septic tanks are groundless -- the reduced water flow probably is 
beneficial, Steele said. And although the sewer line research is not yet 
complete, Steele said preliminary studies indicate low-flush toilets won't 
damage or plug drain lines and will clear wastes just as readily as models that 
use three or four times as much water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a public and emotional issue more than it is technical," Steele 
said of the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Tests show that low-flush toilets push wastes 40 feet down a drain line with 
each flush cycle -- the same distance required of toilets that use much more 
water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure that there is no difference in this performance between laboratory 
studies and field conditions, Steele said, tests will be conducted in homes in 
Florida, Arizona and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Our experience may or may not be scientifically representative, but our 
1.4-gallon toilet has resulted in no perceptible change in drain behavior 
anywhere in our house. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any reason, I asked Steele, to put off the purchase of a low-flush 
toilet or have any concern that today's water-conserving models won't function 
as intended? "None that I can think of," Steele said. But, he cautioned, "buy 
from a reputable manufacturer." 
</P>
<P>
The decision on which brand was more difficult. There are several 
considerations. First, some low-flush toilets -- especially foreign-made models 
-- use mechanical components that are not standardized with what can be bought 
at the average hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
Second, some manufacturers have jumped into the low-flush market, only to bail 
out. 
</P>
<P>
For example, we had seen an effective low-flush toilet in use at a hotel in Big 
Sur. The hotel referred me to its plumbing contractor, who reported that the 
distributor had vanished, leaving owners of the toilets unable to find 
replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
Our search for a brand to buy included review of half a dozen domestic and 
foreign-made toilets. Eventually, the field narrowed to two candidates: Eljer 
and Kohler. 
</P>
<P>
Even major manufacturers have had some trouble with the products. Kohler's 
1.6-gallon model has experienced some problems with its filler-valve not 
closing properly in the flush cycle. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, said a Kohler spokeswoman, the firm was forced to temporarily 
suspend shipments from the factory and send replacement valves to wholesalers 
and retail outlets. The problem never affected the toilet's flushing 
efficiency, Kohler said. 
</P>
<P>
There are two generic low-flush types. In one, the entire contents of the water 
tank empty through the bowl, propelled by gravity in the same way most home 
toilets have always worked. 
</P>
<P>
The second type -- and the type we bought -- has a large reserve tank, but the 
tank has an inner compartment containing the 1.6 gallons of water, while ours 
contains 1.4 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
When the flush cycle begins, these models -- called pressure toilets -- use the 
gravitational push mustered by all 5 gallons to make the 1.6 gallons actually 
used rush through with significantly increased force. 
</P>
<P>
The sides of the bowl are at a much higher angle than in conventional toilets 
and water in the bowl remains at a much lower visible level than in 
conventional toilets. Our low-flush Eljer is about as noisy as the old one, but 
refills much faster. 
</P>
<P>
Eljer said it has sold about 200,000 of the model we bought -- called the 
"Ultra-One G." It's named that, ironically, even though it uses 1.4 gallons. 
The name was adopted when the model was introduced in 1984, an Eljer spokesman 
said, and it actually did use just one gallon. But that wasn't enough water to 
clean the bowl, the company said, and the design was modified to 1.4 gallons a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping around, we found most discount plumbing suppliers offered the Eljer 
for $180 to $195 -- the approximate price range for all of the basic models of 
new pressure-operated low-flush toilets. 
</P>
<P>
Gravity models can be found for as little as half that price. Our plumber 
wouldn't install it if we bought it from someone else because of concern the 
unfamiliar new toilet could be damaged. But having said that, he agreed to 
price the toilet we bought competitively -- just $10 more than the lowest we 
found at discount stores. Fair enough, I figured. 
</P>
<P>
Ours was the first such toilet our plumber had ever installed. I did some 
calculations as he worked and figure that our household -- two adults, no 
children -- may save between 8,500 and 12,000 gallons of water this year.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: ULTRA-LOW-FLOW TOILET STINGY WITH WATER USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We still have the old original toilets in our house. Should we expect 
to save much money on our water bills by installing a new ultra-low-flow 
toilet? What types are available and do they flush adequately? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: A new ultra-low-flow toilet can pay back its entire price many times 
with lower water bills over its life. Using less water keeps future water rates 
lower because fewer new treatment plants are needed. Excessive water usage is 
one of the greatest threats to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The most common ultra-low-flow toilets use about 1.5 gallons per flush (gpf). 
If your house was built before 1980, it probably has a 5.5-gpf toilet. In the 
early 1980s, 3.5 gpf became the standard. For a family of four, switching from 
a 5.5-gpf to a 1.5-gpf toilet saves about 24,000 gallons of water per year -- a 
70% savings. 
</P>
<P>
Two common types of ultra-low-flow toilets are the gravity type and the 
flushometer tank type. The gravity type works like your standard toilet, but 
has a special bowl and trap design. This provides adequate flushing action with 
less water. Since it uses less water, it is quieter and take only 45 seconds to 
refill. Both types look like standard toilets. 
</P>
<P>
Flushometer tanks use a special cylindrical chamber inside the toilet tank. As 
the chamber fills with water after a flush, the water pressure compresses the 
air in it. When the toilet is flushed, this compressed air forces out the water 
under pressure to give a forceful positive flush. 
</P>
<P>
The bowl is cleared in only 10 seconds, but it takes about 60 to 90 seconds to 
refill the tank. Flushometer tank toilets work best if you have normal to high 
water pressure in your area. Check with a local plumber about your water 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
There are also some super-low-flow toilets that use less than one-half gpf. One 
type uses an electric air compressor to assist in the flushing. This produces a 
very vigorous flush to clear the bowl with almost no water. 
</P>
<P>
Another toilet uses electric elements to incinerate the waste instead of water 
to flush it away. As the waste is vaporized and burned to a fine white powder, 
the vapors are vented outdoors. Since it is incinerated at very high 
temperatures, germs are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
When you buy a new toilet, check the specifications carefully. Many so-called 
water saver toilets are just a standard 3.5 gpf design. The prices for 
ultra-low-flow toilets range from about $90 to more than $300. They are 
available in most designer colors. 
</P>
<P>

of 20 manufacturers of ultra-low-flow toilets, model numbers, water usage 
(gpf), type, price range, number of colors, and chart showing the water bills

Balloon, Platform Framing Defined 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the difference between balloon-framing and platform-framing 
construction. Which type is most energy efficient? 
</P>
<P>
A: In balloon-framing the wall studs run from the foundation all the way up to 
the roof. This is often used in two-story construction or in rooms with high 
cathedral ceilings. Platform-framing builds the second floor walls separately 
on top of the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
With proper construction, there is not a significant difference in energy 
efficiency. Since balloon-framing is generally stronger and more rigid, it may 
result in fewer air leaks over time.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Push For Water Efficiency Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are flushing too much of a precious
resource down the toilet, say two lawmakers who are pushing for
strict water-flow standards on household plumbing fixtures.
   Manufacturers are fighting the congressional attempt to impose
first-ever federal efficiency standards on toilets, shower heads and
other fixtures.
   The average American uses more than 18,000 gallons of water a
year in the home _ about 50 gallons a day. Of that, 40 percent goes
down the drain from toilets, said Rep. Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass.
   ``The amount that is used unnecessarily is staggering, especially
in light of the fact that new technology to improve performance of
water-saving products is commercially available,'' he said.
   Atkins and Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., have drafted legislation
that would mandate national water efficiency standards for household
plumbing fixtures such as faucets, washing machines, dishwashers,
shower heads and toilets.
   The largest savings would come from better toilets.
   Only one state, Massachusetts, has imposed toilet efficiency
standards.
   Amy Vickers, project manager at the Massachusetts Water Resource
Authority, estimates that the new 1.6 gallons-per-flush state
standard, which took effect earlier this month, will save the
typical Boston household $70 a year.
   Older toilets typically use 5 gallons of water per flush; newer
models, 3.5 gallons.
   Massachusetts' standard will save the state about 70 million
gallons of water daily by early in the 21st century, Ms. Vickers
projected.
   On a national scale, that would mean a savings of 2 billion to 3
billion gallons of water a day from the most efficient toilets, she
said.
   Proponents of low-flow standards say they could eliminate the
need for building expensive water supplies and water-treatment
facilities, especially in big cities such as Boston and New York
where officials already are worrying about balancing limited water
supplies against ever-increasing demand.
   Toilet manufacturers oppose the legislation, saying it would
create an unnecessary bureaucracy and amount to an improper
intrusion by Washington into an area that has been traditionally
handled by local governments.
   ``It puts the federal government for the first time directly into
the process of writing building codes and standards. And the federal
government, for the last 200 and some-odd years, has tried very hard
to stay out of that process and leave it to the states and local
communities,'' said Richard Church, president of the Plumbing
Manufacturers Institute.
   Church said it would be dangerous to ``force manufacturers to
bring that technology out before it's completely tested,''
especially for installing the more efficient ``water closets'' _ as
the industry still calls toilets _ in older houses.
   ``We're quite concerned that in specific localities there's apt
to be severe problems if 1.6 (gallons-per-flush toilets) are the
only ones available,'' said Church. ``You're asking for problems.''
   ``Water closets are flushed with gravity. At 1.6 gallons, we're
right on the edge of what gravity can actually do,'' he said.
   But proponents of the legislation scoff at the suggestion that
the bill's 1992 deadline for more efficient toilets would be
difficult for the industry to meet.
   ``This isn't like trying to go to the moon,'' said Ms. Vickers.
   The two leading U.S. toilet manufacturers, American Standard and
Kohler Co., are fighting the legislation.
   Although the toilet provision has drawn the most controversy, the
legislation is, as an Atkins aide, Rob Henken, says, ``by no means
just a toilet bill.''
   The proposal would set a 2.5 gallons-per-minute standard for
shower heads and kitchen faucets, a 2 gallons-per-minute standard
for bathroom faucets and a 1 gallon-per-flush standard for urinals,
Henken said.
   Those requirements would take effect in January 1991, a year
before the standard for toilets, he said.
   The bill also would require the Energy Department, within three
years of enactment, to set water efficiency standards for washing
machines and dishwashers.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Wyche Fowler's plan to save water by
legislating more efficient toilets isn't going down well with
plumbers and toilet makers, who contend the public is more
concerned with toilet performance than water consumption.
   ``Conservation efforts will ultimately fail if proper regard is
not given to the reasonable public demand for sound performance
standards in water supply and waste disposal,'' said George Bliss,
assistant director of training for the United Association of
Plumbers and Pipefitters.
   Bliss testified Wednesday at a hearing before the Senate
Commerce consumer subcommittee on legislation introduced by Fowler,
D-Ga., and Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., to set national water
efficiency standards for toilets and other plumbing fixtures.
   The legislation would require that all new toilets installed
beginning in 1992 use only 1.6 gallons of water per flush. State
and local building codes generally have required a 3.5 gallon
standard since the early 1970s.
   ``When the amount of water is cut in half, there is reason to
doubt whether the system will operate properly,'' Bliss said,
arguing Congress should not act until more research is done on such
issues as ``to what extent will bowl staining become a factor due
to low flush.''
   Fowler said concerns such as those raised by Bliss are nothing
more than ``red herrings.'' He said toilets that meet the 1.6
gallon per flush standard, as well as other efficient plumbing
fixtures, already exist and ``are proven to work.''
   Supporters of the legislation told the Senate panel that in the
past year, seven states with 40 percent of the nation's population
have adopted standards requiring that new toilets use only 1.6
gallons per flush.
   ``There is no evidence to support the claim that there would be
a problem transporting solid waste down drain lines with low flush
toilets,'' said Amy Vickers, a water resources consultant from
Boston who became known as the ``commode queen'' last year during
her efforts to have the 1.6 gallon per flush standard adopted in
Massachusetts.
   Fowler said the bill would help reduce the strain on the
nation's water supplies by putting ``a stop to the massive waste of
water in faucets, water closets, showerheads.'' He said replacing
all such fixtures in American homes with more efficient models
would save almost 7 billion gallons of water a day.
   Craig Selover, a vice president of the Delta Faucet Co., said
the Plumbing Manufacturers Institute opposes the legislation
because it would ``create a needless federal bureaucracy, wasting
taxpayers' money'' and do little to promote water conservation.
   ``The legislation would, quite probably, create a negative
attitude toward water conservation among consumers, thereby
hampering important and much needed efforts to conserve precious
potable water resources,'' he said.

CONSERVATION: L.A. UNVEILS A PROGRAM TO HELP RESIDENTS PAY THE COST OF 
SWITCHING TO LOW-FLUSH TOILETS.

Faced with a continuing statewide drought and diminishing out-of-state water 
supplies, Los Angeles officials announced a pilot program Tuesday in which the 
city's Department of Water and Power will offer $100 rebates to residents who 
replace older toilets with ultra-low-flush models. 
</P>
<P>
With two of the models on hand as props during a morning news conference, Mayor 
Tom Bradley kicked off the novel program that encourages Los Angeles residents 
to replace older, water-guzzling toilets with ones that use only 1.6 gallons of 
water per flush -- a reduction that could save Los Angeles as much as 80 
million gallons of water by the time the one-year program ends. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for us to develop every means of water conservation that we 
can," said Bradley, who was joined by City Council members and representatives 
of local water agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The placement of low-flush models in homes throughout Los Angeles, Bradley 
added, "could save a significant amount of water that is otherwise now wasted 
by being flushed through the system." 
</P>
<P>
The DWP and Metropolitan Water District have budgeted $750,000 for the pilot 
program, which seeks to replace 7,500 older toilets -- which may use up to 
seven gallons of water with each push of the lever -- with the ultra-low-flush 
models. Residents of single and multifamily dwellings who participate in the 
program would be given $100 rebate checks upon verification of installation by 
DWP officials. 
</P>
<P>
With some of the toilets selling for as little as $50, the rebate check could 
"defer all or a big portion of the cost of replacing the toilet," said Rick 
Caruso, president of the Board of Water and Power, adding that residents could 
choose to do the installation themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The project is the first such rebate offer made by the DWP in the area of water 
conservation, according to officials, and it comes at a time when California's 
water resources are rapidly diminishing in the midst of a four-year drought. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the best means of water conservation available because it's the 
machine that does it for you. . . . You don't have to change your life style," 
said Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for the city because we don't have to take the water out of Mono 
Lake," Galanter continued, referring to the body of water in the Eastern 
Sierra. And, she added, "We don't have to purchase it from other resources." 
</P>
<P>
Besides minimizing water waste, DWP officials said, such conservation efforts 
can decrease water costs for single-family customers by approximately $19.50 
per toilet per year, and reduce pressure on Los Angeles' overtaxed sewage 
system -- a system that became so burdened with storm overflow this past 
weekend that a city treatment plant had to divert some of its waste into the 
ocean to prevent it from flowing into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
State and local officials have taken steps in the past to conserve water that 
is often flushed away and wasted. A state standard was set in 1983 that 
required all toilets sold in the state to use only 3.5 gallons of water per 
flush. The Los Angeles City Council took the action a step further, approving 
an ordinance in 1988 that required all toilets installed in newly constructed 
homes or residential additions to use 1.5 gallons per flush. 
</P>
<P>
If the rebate program shows significant water savings for customers, the 
project could extend indefinitely, Caruso said.

water is serious business in the fifth year of a drought, San Jose City

<TEXT>     Known in bathroom-wise circles as ULFs, the toilets are said to use only
1.6 gpf (that's gallons per flush) as opposed to more traditional water
closets, which use anywhere from 3.5 to 7 gpf.;    San Jose's water-watchers
estimate that toilets account for about 40 percent of all water used indoors.
The result is up to 15 million gallons flushed away to the city's sewer plant
each day.;    The city's aim is to find out whether it can put together a
workable program to encourage or require homeowners and businesses to replace
their toilets with ultra-low-flush models.;    And just to keep everybody up
to date, the city has called together architects, plumbers, plumbing suppliers
and representatives of builders to talk toilet at a workshop scheduled for
Jan. 24.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley City Council voted Monday to require all new construction 
projects to use ultra-low flush toilets and urinals. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-0 vote makes the ordinance effective July 5. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Coons, director of Simi Valley's Department of Public Works, said the 
new ordinance will save 14,000 gallons of water from the amount that would be 
used by conventional toilets in each new building. 
</P>
<P>
Coons said the ultra-low flush toilets use about 1.6 gallons per flush, 
compared with about 3.5 gallons in a standard toilet. The new urinals use one 
gallon of water per flush, about a gallon less than the amount used by a 
standard urinal. 
</P>
<P>
State law mandates that water conservation fixtures be installed in all 
construction projects beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Coons said that adopting such an ordinance now will help the city and the 
county avoid passing more drastic water-rationing measures later. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County and the cities of Ventura, Ojai, Oxnard, Fillmore and Thousand 
Oaks have already adopted similar ordinances. The cities of Port Hueneme and 
Moorpark also are considering such measures. CARLOS V. LOZANO

<LEADPARA>  For people who ponder the merits of the pressurized flush vs. the gravity
flush, or people who calculate toilet efficiency in GPF (gallons per flush) to
the 10th degree, 1992 will be a very good year in San Jose.;   The city's

these measures were discussed at a council meeting Tuesday.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IN '92, S.J. MAY BE FLUSH WITH WATER-SAVING TOILETS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     On Jan. 1, ultra-low-flush, or ULF, toilets will be required in all new
housing throughout the state. These next-generation models use only 1.6 GPF,
at high pressure, compared to 5 to 7 GPF for basic toilets, or 3.5 GPF for
some recent water-saving models, which also use the older, low-pressure,
gravity technology.;   Experts say a family of four switching from an old
toilet to ULF can save 60 gallons a day. That helps the city twice over: It
conserves water and it eases the South Bay's maxed-out sewage system.;   The
city probably will pass its own law in January with even stiffer standards,
mandating that the new-fangled toilets be installed whenever a bathroom is
remodeled.;   San Jose hopes to get 171,000 ULF toilets installed by 1996, at
a cost of nearly $13 million.;   The city council took one step toward toilet
consciousness Tuesday. It voted unanimously to draft the bathroom-remodeling
ordinance.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  PICKLED or white-tone finishes for wood are difficult to achieve over existing
darker finishes.;    Q I want to refinish my kitchen cabinets with a pickled
finish. They are oak with a medium finish. I know I'll have to do some
sanding, but how much? What else do I need to do?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Peninsula Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  WHEN A PICKLED FINISH WORKS BEST  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Do It Yourself  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     A The fashionable pickled finish, which is basically a white stain with a
protective coating, looks best and is simplest to apply on pale woods that
have not been previously finished. Pine, one of the palest woods, is ideal for
pickling. Oak can be pickled, but some oak is quite dark and might even need
bleached for best results. The previous finish and/or stain will have to be
completely removed by stripping or sanding, as it is important for the
pickling stain to fill pores and grain of the wood, which helps give pickled
wood its attractive tone.;    I suggest experimenting with a single cabinet
door, which can be removed for easier handling. If the process is too tedious
or the results aren't good, a simpler finish such as a light-tone enamel can
be used.;    Here's an outline of the procedure:;    Remove old finish with a
paint-varnish stripper, following all cautions and instructions on the
container, including use of eye and hand protection. To help remove old finish
from pores after the surface finish is removed, apply another coat of stripper
and go over the wood with a brass-bristle refinishing brush. Clean the surface
with mineral spirits (paint thinner) and sand.;    The basic pickling finish
can be flat white latex paint, thinned about one-third with water, or a
special pickling stain such as ZAR Country White. Brush the paint on a
workable area, such as a cabinet door or side. On light wood, wipe off the
paint almost immediately with rags, working across the grain so some paint
remains in pores. Waiting a short time before wiping can help lighten darker
wood, but the paint should not be allowed to overdry. Some refinishers
experiment on scraps to get the correct waiting time.;    When the paint
dries, sand lightly and remove dust with a sticky tack cloth or vacuum. Apply
two coats of a non-yellowing clear finish. One good choice is a water-based
protective finish, such as Carver Tripp's Safe &amp; Simple.;    Q I want to
replace an old toilet that uses 5 1/2 gallons of water per flush. The
plumbing-supply dealers in my area all sell toilets with 3 1/2-gallon tanks
only. Plumbers have told me the smaller tanks tend to block sewers. I feel the
more water the better, so where can I get a 5 1/2-gallon toilet?;    A Toilets
that use five gallons or more per flush have been virtually phased out because
they waste water. Most manufacturers began switching to 3 1/2-gallon tanks in
the late 1970s, but even those tanks are considered water wasters in some
areas. The new trend, especially in states such as California where water is
increasingly scarce, is toward ultra-low-flush toilets that use only about 1
1/2 gallons per flush. Compressed air is used in some low-water models to give
additional velocity to the water during a flush.;    It's true that some
plumbers are critical of water-saving toilets, but experience has shown that 3
1/2 gallons is generally more than adequate for flushing. Most homes have so
many other water-using fixtures and appliances, such as clothes washers and
dishwashers, that sewer lines are kept clear unless there are other factors
causing blocks, such as tree roots. At any rate, if you insist on a
five-gallon flusher, you might have to get it from a salvage yard.;    Q We
recently purchased an older log cabin with logs in sound condition. I'm
wondering if I should treat the logs to help prevent deterioration. I prefer
to keep the natural color. What, if anything, should I use?;    A Any
unpainted outdoor wood will benefit if it is treated periodically with a
water-repellent sealer, which will help prevent mildew, rotting, cracking and
warping. Many log-home manufacturers recommend using a stain or sealer with
water repellent on logs.  </TEXT>

   Hai Nguyen, a city mechanical engineer,
laughed self-consciously as he unrolled toilet paper while visitors
watched a test flush of the porcelain privy he had rigged.
   Nguyen pushed a button and a pressurized tank in the Water
Closet Inc. fixture discharged a shot of water into the toilet
bowl, which then emptied in nine seconds.
   ``This is the wave of the future,'' said an impressed R.J.
Martin, the city's chief plumbing inspector.
   Welcome to the city's toilet test lab, where the next generation
of high-tech toilets, which use a mere 1{ gallons per flush, are
being put through their paces. No commode can be sold until it has
passed the code.
   The Los Angeles lab's flush requirements are set by the American
National Standard Institute, which specifies that the toilet paper
field test, ``shall be comprised of an appropriate number of
six-sheet strips of single-ply roll toilet paper, each crumpled
into a loose ball measuring 2 to 3 inches in diameter.''
   Latex cylinders, ping-pong balls and other materials are also
specified by ANSI for certain tests. Another standard determines if
a toilet can rinse off a line drawn inside the rim with a
water-soluble marker.
   ``I think Los Angeles is one of the few _ if not the only _
municipality in the country with a test lab to make sure toilets
are in compliance,'' said James S. Nishimoto, whose mechanical
engineering division oversees the lab operated by the city
Department of Building and Safety.
   Within a stone's throw of the Los Angeles River, city engineers
at the laboratory ensure that toilets from designer thrones by Ifo
of Sweden to the American Standard models meet the same
requirements for flushing, scouring and rinsing.
   For some critics, the lab's certification of low-flush toilets
is taking too much time and hampering water conservation efforts in
a drought year.
   A new measure passed by the Los Angeles City Council in April
seeks to conserve water and ease the strain on the city's aging and
overwhelmed sewer system.
   Among other things, the measure requires installation of
``low-flush'' toilets for new construction. The toilets use just 1{
gallons per flush, compared to the usual 3 to 6 gallons.
   About 10 low-flush models have been developed, but only one has
been certified for use in Los Angeles, said lab manager Yogen R.
Thakar.
   ``It's just another example of a bureaucracy going around in
circles to me,'' said Larry Farwell, water conservation coordinator
for the Goleta Water District in Santa Barbara County.
   Certification is pending for the WCI unit, which was tested
recently, Thakar said. It takes from eight to 10 hours to test a
privy, but three to four months to certify each model. ``It's a
bureaucratic process,'' he explained.
   Critics also complain that the city's lab charges a minimum $500
to test each model, and $300 each year afterward to renew its
certification.
   ``It's totally unnecessary,'' said Tom Scheller of DEA Bathroom
Machineries, a plumbing importer and distributor based in Murphys,
Calif. ``The city is just using it as a means of generating
revenue.''
   The fees charged by the lab pay for most of its $600,000
operating budget, Nishimoto said. The lab also tests garden-hose
pesticide sprayers, commercial washing machines, dishwashers, ice
machines and just about anything else that is connected to the
city's potable water supply.
   ``I do feel that it serves an important function,'' Nishimoto
said. ``It's an area that's in public health, and I really don't
think any other lab gives it the same kind of attention that we
do.''

FINES SET FOR FAILING TO SAVE WATER; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: THOSE RESIDENTS WHO DON'T REPLACE WATER-GUZZLING PLUMBING WITH 
LOW-FLOW FIXTURES FACE A PENALTY OF $1 A MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica residents soon will have a new incentive to conserve water: 
They'll be charged a monthly fine if they don't. 
</P>
<P>
On a 5-2 vote, the City Council Tuesday night approved the fines -- or 
"conservation incentive fees," as city officials prefer to call them -- as part 
of its five-year, $2.9-million program to conserve water by replacing 
water-guzzling plumbing fixtures with low-flow fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
State water officials said they believe the law, which takes effect July 1, 
would make Santa Monica the first California city to require the installation 
of water-saving fixtures in existing residences. 
</P>
<P>
The law calls for residents and landlords to replace old toilets with new ones 
that use a maximum of 1.6 gallons per flush, and to install shower heads that 
limit flow to 3 gallons or less per minute. 
</P>
<P>
After July 1, owners of single-family residences who have not complied will 
have $1 a month added to their water bills, and owners of multifamily buildings 
will be charged 65 cents each month per unit. Commercial properties are not 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
All residents will be charged the fine through their water bill until the new 
fixtures are inspected and verified by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Low-flow toilets cost from $99 to $250, according to city officials. They 
estimate that single-family homeowners can recoup their costs through lower 
water bills in 9 1/2 to 21 months, depending on whether they install the 
fixtures themselves or hire a plumber. For apartment owners, the pay-back 
period ranges from 11 months to two years. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica already requires low-flow toilets and shower heads in all new 
construction. Similar laws are in effect in Los Angeles and many other 
California cities. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and several other cities also require retrofitting of existing 
homes whenever they are sold. But a spokesman at the State Department of Water 
Resources' drought center said Santa Monica's new monthly charge on existing 
residences was unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage residents to retrofit, Santa Monica is giving away 1,000 new 
toilets to residents on a first-come, first-served basis. Cash rebates of $100 
per bathroom will also be given to residents who retrofit. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's conservation coordinator, Atossa Soltani, said about 1,300 new 
toilets have been installed so far in the city. About 700 of the free toilets 
and about $41,000 in rebates have been distributed so far to property owners. 
</P>
<P>
The city has set a goal of retrofitting 25% of the city's 11,400 single-family 
homes and 36,500 units of multifamily housing within the next five years. If 
that goal is reached, at the end of the five years about 936 acre-feet of water 
could be saved annually, or about 835,200 gallons per day. 
</P>
<P>
But so far the city is behind schedule. To achieve its goal, about 4,000 
toilets would have to be installed each year, according to Soltani. At the 
current rate, less than 3,000 new toilets would be installed by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
According to Metropolitan Water District estimates, 45% of all water used in a 
household is flushed down toilets. About 30% of the water is used for bathing.

CITY PLAN CALLS FOR RESIDENTIAL WATER-USE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

San Diegans will face mandatory, restrictive schedules for watering their 
lawns, washing their cars and filling their swimming pools beginning in July, 
if the City Council adopts a $5.1-million water conservation program to be 
unveiled at Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-point conservation program, described by the city staff as "the 
broadest, most extensive set of long-range programs proposed by any water 
agency or district in the state," also recommends $100 rebates for installation 
of ultra-low-volume toilets, banning the hosing down of sidewalk and patio 
areas, and a three-year crash program to outfit all homes and apartments built 
before 1981 with water-saving plumbing devices. 
</P>
<P>
The multifaceted program is targeted at both household use of water and outside 
irrigation, which consumes 40% of the city's water supply, said Marsi Steirer, 
who developed the program for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What we were trying to do is satisfy the needs and the interests of the people 
of San Diego who are our customers" with a primarily voluntary program, Steirer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled to be unveiled March 7, the program is being brought 
before the City Council on Tuesday because of pressure from the Sierra Club, 
which will ask a federal judge Wednesday to build water conservation 
requirements into a proposed legal settlement that governs construction of the 
city's $2.8-billion secondary sewage treatment system. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club wants U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster to mandate measures 
that the organization claims could reduce sewage flows by 50 million gallons 
daily over the next eight years, allowing for a substantially smaller and 
less-costly sewage system than the one designed by city planners. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club believes that this could be accomplished by replacing every 
toilet in the 1.7-million-member Metropolitan Sewerage District with 
ultra-low-volume 1.6-gallon toilets. 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys, and their counterparts from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, the U.S. Justice Department and the state Regional Water Quality 
Control Board, will argue that a legal settlement that governs treatment of 
waste is no place for water conservation requirements. 
</P>
<P>
City staffers also want city lawyers to propose adoption of the conservation 
programs in lieu of monetary fines that the city may have to pay the federal 
government for sewage spills into local waterways between 1983 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members have demanded to know how the city proposes to conserve 
water if it refuses to adopt the Sierra Club's demands. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is contained in a lengthy report that outlines 12 separate programs 
ranging from extensive public education and data collection to a mandatory 
odd-even schedule for watering lawns and washing cars. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, residents with even-numbered addresses could use potable water 
for outdoor purposes within certain hours on even-numbered days, and residents 
with odd-numbered addresses would be restricted to odd-numbered days, Steirer 
said. Washing sidewalks and paved areas, and operating ornamental fountains 
would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
City staff is asking the council to adopt the program next month for 
implementation in July. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, who has not decided whether she supports the 
concept, said that the program "is very likely to come this summer. I don't 
know that you have to do that all the time, but in San Diego, with our 
shortages" it may become necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be as (residents') water and sewage bills go up, they may do it of 
their own accord, because it saves them money," McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
The staff also is recommending a pilot program to test the effectiveness of 
ultra-low-volume toilets and water-efficient testing devices, followed by a 
one-year program to retrofit 3,000 homes with 6,000 new 1.6-gallon toilets, 
which, under state law, will be mandatory in new construction beginning in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Toilets installed before 1981 use five to seven gallons per flush, while 
toilets installed since then use 3.5 gallons per flush, Steirer said. 
Replacement with a 1.6-gallon toilet would save a family of three living in a 
post-1981 home 48 gallons of water each day, or 17,250 gallons per year. 
</P>
<P>
But the program must first be tested to ensure that it works with older 
plumbing systems. "We know for sure that they work in new construction. There 
have been studies," Steirer said. 
</P>
<P>
But the city does not yet know whether the low-volume toilets provide 
"satisfactory transport of waste from the toilet through the sewer line," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another point of the plan proposes a $100 rebate for every retrofitted toilet, 
which would pay for a substantial portion of the estimated $160 to $220 cost of 
purchase and installation of each unit, Steirer said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebate program would add $1 million to next year's budget. Currently, there 
is no funding reserved for any of the water conservation programs. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive proposal, at a cost of nearly $2.9 million over the next 14 
months, is a recommendation to outfit more than 100,000 pre-1981 single- and 
multifamily residences with water-saving shower heads, toilet dams and dye 
tablets that would reveal if water is leaking from toilet tanks into toilet 
bowls. 
</P>
<P>
The metal and rubber dams would displace 1 gallon of water from toilet tanks, 
and along with the shower heads and dye tablets could save the average 
household 20.2 gallons of water each day. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the first 50,000 homes would be given the devices during a 
10-week period this spring. 
</P>
<P>
City inspectors would follow up by touring neighborhoods to determine how many 
homes had posted a sign indicating use of the devices, Steirer said. 
</P>
<P>
A later telephone survey would gauge customer satisfaction with the devices, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District has agreed to pay $425,000 toward installation 
of the first 50,000 sets of devices. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been implemented by the cities of San Jose, Irvine and 
Pasadena.

SANTA MONICA PUTS CREATIVITY IN CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of a six-story, 93,000-square-foot office building in Santa 
Monica was in danger of not getting his project approved because the building 
would exceed its daily limit on waste water by 1,858 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was resolved when the developer, Search Builders Inc., agreed to 
replace old toilets at a school with new toilets that use less water, in effect 
offsetting the excess sewage discharged by the project. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the City Council adopted an ordinance requiring all construction to 
include low-flow toilets and shower heads. Now, as incentive to have the more 
efficient fixtures installed in all existing residences, the city is willing to 
pay property owners $100 per bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Those are just two innovative ways Santa Monica is trying to reduce water 
consumption at a time when the future of the state's water supply is uncertain, 
and demand is overburdening the Los Angeles Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Monica has a water conservation ethic more than other communities," said 
Ed Thornhill, water conservation manager for the Metropolitan Water District, 
which supplies water to 15 million people from Ventura to the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Says Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane: "I think it is fair to say that the city 
is taking the leadership in developing an environmental policy. We feel we have 
an obligation to do our share of addressing the problem of bay pollution. In 
our judgment, it is the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Most cities in the Southland have some voluntary water conservation measures, 
most of which were first implemented during the 1977-78 drought. Some cities 
have even taken part in Metropolitan Water District pilot programs, including 
residential water audits and leak detection services. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, recognizing that the city's construction boom was dumping too much 
sewage into the Hyperion treatment plant, last year made many emergency water 
conservation measures mandatory, including a ban on washing down sidewalks and 
driveways, forcing restaurants to serve water only on request and requiring 
property owners to fix leaky faucets and toilets. 
</P>
<P>
The city also required the installation of low-flow shower heads and 
toilet-tank displacement devices in all homes. The shower heads and plastic 
bags for toilet tanks were distributed free to property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles also is limiting building permits to reduce development to about 
30% of last year's pace. The city has been unable to force surrounding cities 
that dump into Hyperion to adopt similar restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica, which has led the nation with other innovative public policy 
matters such as rent control, hopes to go a step beyond Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the City Council made permanent most of its water conservation 
measures -- many similar to those adopted by Los Angeles -- and extended for 
another year its 1.36% limit on yearly sewage increases. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are expected to come up with permanent restrictions within a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they are looking for creative ways to allow development without 
overloading the sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
Developments of more than 100,000 square feet must provide on-site water 
treatment facilities. Both the Water Garden and Colorado Place projects, office 
and retail complexes that each are over a million square feet, are building 
such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
For smaller projects, city staff members have been looking for ways to offset 
new sewage by reducing the waste water of existing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Atossa Soltani, Santa Monica's conservation coordinator, said the city recently 
was able to achieve that goal with Search Builders' project. 
</P>
<P>
Soltani said the builders of the Security Pacific Courtyard office project at 
Arizona Avenue and 4th Street paid about $30,000 to replace the toilets at Will 
Rogers School with low-flow models. 
</P>
<P>
"In this particular case, the city has been reasonable," said Todd Calish, vice 
president of design and construction for Search Builders. "It shows that it 
isn't necessary to cut back on development to achieve a reduction in waste 
water uses." 
</P>
<P>
"This is one way developers can meet no-net sewage growth," said Councilwoman 
Christine Reed. "This particular program works because not only do they get new 
fixtures, the schools save money with a lower water bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are making a conscious effort in the city to be a good example to 
our residents. My own personal view is that you can't preach water conservation 
unless you have the wherewithal to address your personal practices and your 
municipal practices." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the City Council will consider spurring replacement of the 
water-guzzling toilets with low-flow toilets by providing financial incentives 
to owners of homes and apartment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Metropolitan Water District estimates, 45% of all household water 
is flushed down toilets. Bathing accounts for another 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's goal is to retrofit bathroom fixtures in at least 25% of the 
11,400 single-family homes and 36,500 multifamily households over five years. 
At the end of five years about 936 acre-feet of water could be saved annually 
-- or about 835,200 gallons per day. 
</P>
<P>
Toilets installed before 1981 use five to seven gallons per flush on average, 
and older shower heads consume an average of four to six gallons per minute. 
That compares with new ultra-low-flow toilets which use a maximum of 1.6 
gallons per flush and low-flow shower heads that consume a maximum of three 
gallons per minute. 
</P>
<P>
The program offers a $100 rebate for each bathroom retrofitted, but imposes a 
surcharge on customers' water bills until all water-wasting bathroom fixtures 
are replaced. Beginning April 1, 1990, each homeowner who has not installed the 
new toilets will be charged $1 a month, and each apartment owner 65 cents per 
unit during the first year. 
</P>
<P>
The surcharge may be adjusted in subsequent years depending on response to the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
To promote the plan, the city would give away 1,000 free toilets on a 
first-come, first-serve basis (limit one toilet per property owner). The 
low-flow toilets retail from $99 to $250. 
</P>
<P>
Tank dams, displacement bags and other water-reducing devices would not qualify 
as substitutions for the ultra low-flow toilets. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that homeowners can recoup their costs in 9 1/2 to 21 
months, depending on whether the fixtures are installed by a plumber or a 
homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
For apartment owners, the pay-back period ranges from nearly 11 months to two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which would begin Oct. 1 if approved, is budgeted at nearly $2.9 
million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
The city would pay for the program from the surcharge, general water revenues 
and a grant from the Metropolitan Water District, the city's major water 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing would include billing inserts, flyers, displays at plumbing and 
home-improvement stores, newspaper ads and radio announcements. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that apartment owners may be reluctant to participate in the 
program because of the costs involved, officials would emphasize a reduction in 
water and sewer bills, a reduction in material costs with the rebates and free 
demonstrations and do-it-yourself installation training. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the program will be successful," said the Metropolitan Water 
District's Thornhill. "We're hoping other communities see how successful the 
program is in Santa Monica and will adopt it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Reed agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a population that values the ocean and the environment," she said. "Our 
population wants to make the bay better. We would be hypocritical if we were 
not doing what we are doing."

<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CLARA; WATER; CONSERVATION; PROGRAM  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The Santa Clara Valley Water District signed onto a statewide urban
conservation plan Tuesday that, if widely observed, could save enough water
throughout California to meet the needs of 5 million people a year.;   The
plan, developed over the past two years by a coalition of water suppliers and
environmentalists, calls for urban water systems to be more efficient, outlaws
wasteful practices and promotes frugality.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  WATER DISTRICT ENDORSES MAJOR CONSERVATION PLAN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to end of article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But there's a catch. The State Water Conservation Coalition proposal is
strictly voluntary, carrying only the threat of embarrassment to ensure
compliance.;   "This is not a contract we're signing," Leo Cournoyer, the
district's water supply manager, told the district board.;   Water supply
agencies that sign the plan agree to develop conservation programs over the
next three years and to adhere to them until the year 2001.;   Called the
Urban Water Conservation Charter, the plan calls for such conservation
measures as installation of low-flow shower heads and ultra-low flush toilets.
It recommends leak-detection programs, indoor and outdoor water use audits,
and adoption of landscape water conservation ordinances.;   Those so-called
"best management practices" were worked out by the coalition, chaired by
Contra Costa County Supervisor Sunne McPeak and Ventura County Supervisor John
Flynn.;   The plan is being circulated among the major urban water agencies
for adoption and will be a recommendation to the State Water Resources Control
Board as a guide to setting state water policy. It is to go into effect Sept.
1.;   "Most (water) retailers are doing a great deal already," Cournoyer
said.;   The district board approved signing the agreement on a 5-0 vote, with
directors Joe Judge and Joe Pandit absent.;   The state board is establishing
water quality standards for San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin
River Delta that will affect how much water can be diverted wisely for urban
use.;   Although the Santa Clara Valley Water District is a wholesaler, it
signed the plan as an umbrella agency for four of the county's retail water
suppliers -- the Great Oaks Water Co. and the city agencies of Morgan Hill,
Cupertino and Sunnyvale.;   San Jose Water Co., the largest in the county with
203,000 customers, endorsed the plan but did not sign it because some of the
elements would require it to seek approval from the California Public
Utilities Commission.;   The city of Gilroy declined to participate because
officials don't agree with all of the recommendations in the plan and consider
some of its provisions another layer of bureaucracy.;   Six other private and
municipal water suppliers in Santa Clara County have yet to act.;   What is
most remarkable about the plan is that it was negotiated among normally
competing interests -- Northern California vs. Southern California, water
agencies vs. environmental groups.;   The coalition said the plan can result
in saving 500,000 to 1 million acre-feet of water annually -- about the amount
consumed by 2.5 million to 5 million people.; Saving water; Here are some of
the "best management practices" in the Urban Water Conservation Charter. Some
already have been implemented in Santa Clara County in response to five years
of drought.; (box)City codes would be proposed requiring installation in new
homes of "ultra-low flush" toilets that use 1.6 gallons or less per flush,
compared to old-style toilets that use five gallons or more. Low-flow shower
heads and toilet tank dams would be distributed.; (box)Water suppliers would
encourage replacing toilets in existing homes and commercial and industrial
buildings with the new models, possibly by providing financial incentives or
seeking city ordinances requiring replacement on sale of the property.;
(box)Major water users would be audited to identify potential savings.
Conservation devices would be installed to reduce consumption.; (box)Water
suppliers would search aggressively for leaks and plug them.;
(box)Water-stingy landscaping guidelines would be adopted for commercial
projects and large multifamily housing complexes. There would be incentives
for single-family homeowners to install drought-resistant landscaping.;
(box)Gutter flooding and fountains that do not reuse water would be banned.;
(box)In cities that do not require water meters, such as Sacramento and
Fresno, all new hookups would be metered and plans would be adopted to
retrofit meters on existing homes.; (box)Pricing structures should give a
break to those who conserve and charge more to those who waste water.; Source:

   The phrase ``doggie do'' has a different
meaning for two sisters who make it their livelihood.
   Diane Fenger and Arlene Steinle train canine coiffeurs to handle
everything from American Kennel Club show styles to the occasional
doggie dye job.
   The words ``dog groomer'' are taboo at their Tara Lara Academy of
K-9 Hair Design because the sisters believe that's like saying the
Cordon Bleu turns out cooks.
   ``We aren't teaching basic dog grooming,'' said Fenger, who
founded the school 20 years ago with her sister. ``We are teaching
all-breed styling, including show work.''
   Fenger, a former hairdresser, traded permanents for pooches in
1968. The academy, highlighted in the sisters' book, ``The Standard
Book of Dog Grooming,'' draws students from around the country. The
school isn't cheap: $795 for a four-week groomer's assistant course,
up to $2,995 for a 16-week master course.
   Students scrub dogs in tubs, cut their hair and dry it with a
blow dryer or a heated cage dryer. The finishing touch includes
ribbons, scarves or bells. Fenger said she also teaches students how
to handle the dogs, including touching the animals in specific
places to control and relax them. She said properly handled dogs are
less likely to bite the hand that grooms them.

   Government handouts have come a long way since the
federal government doled out surplus cheese. In Massachusetts,
they're giving away toilets.
   This summer, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, hoping
to promote an ethic of water conservation, is handing out 2,500
low-flow toilets to communities for public use.
   The Municipal Toilet Replacement Program is designed with the
hope that after residents try the toilets at their town hall or
public library they will buy one for their home, said Jeffrey
Lissack, a spokesman for the program. The toilets cost the authority
$350,000.
   The authority needs to save water to continue adequately
supplying water to 2.5 million people in the Boston area.
   Toilets consume an average of 38 percent of household water.
Conventional toilets use 3.5 gallons to 7 gallons per flush; the
model being given away uses 1.6 gallons or less.
   Starting March 2, the state will require that all new toilets use
no more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush, which is expected to
save more than 3 million gallons of water daily.

PENALTIES STUDIED FOR WASTING WATER

<TEXT>
<P>
As part of an effort to identify water-saving measures, the city of Oxnard is 
studying whether to make wasting water illegal and punishable by jail time and 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released this week, Public Works Director James Frandsen said the 
water-wasting practices covered by the proposed law could include over-watering 
lawns and hosing off driveways and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and businesses also could be penalized under the proposed law for 
maintaining fountains and carwashes that do not recycle water. 
</P>
<P>
Similar laws have been passed in Ventura and Camarillo, while several other 
cities in Ventura County have adopted voluntary water-conservation guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would be part of a water-conservation plan that the City 
Council is expected to consider in September, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The city is now offering residents free water-saving kits that include two 
shower flow devices and two dye tablets that detect leaks in toilet tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard is also offering partial or full rebates to residents who exchange 
older, conventional toilets for new, ultra-low-flush models. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard residents use an average of 160 gallons of water per person per day, one 
of the lowest per-capita rates in the county, according to the report. HUGO

<TEXT>
   A work crew Christmas weekend was
assigned to do nothing but flush the 503 toilets at the Gator Bowl
to prevent a freeze-up at the stadium before the annual New Year's
college football game.
   A freeze in 1983 caused about $400,000 damage in broken water
pipes, so when record cold headed for town last week, officials
hired a crack brigade of toilet flushers to keep water moving
through the plumbing.
   From dusk Friday until noon on Christmas, the 23-member crew
flushed toilets. Each person was responsible for an average of 21.8
toilets each.
   Everything went fine until a power outage shut down stadium
water pumps on Saturday and Sunday. The stadium sustained about
$5,000 damage to plumbing.
   ``When the pumps weren't working and the water pressure was bad,
there wasn't much you could do,'' said sports complex manager
Richard Fagan.

Southern California is facing one of the worst droughts in decades. 
</P>
<P>
As the Los Angeles City Council and officials of other Southland communities 
move closer to mandating cutbacks in household water consumption, all of us 
should be thinking about ways to conserve water around the house. 
</P>
<P>
While much water can be saved by simple common-sense changes in personal habits 
such as not hosing driveways and turning off the water while shaving, there are 
several do-it-yourself conservation and repair techniques that can further 
reduce water use in the home. 
</P>
<P>
According to Maureen Erbeznik, conservation specialist for the city of Santa 
Monica, "Showering is one of the largest residential water usages. Installation 
of low-flow shower heads or flow restrictors can reduce shower water 
consumption by 50% or more. 
</P>
<P>
"Most normal shower heads supply 6 to 8 gallons of water per minute, while 
low-flow or restricted heads allow less than 3 gallons per minute." 
</P>
<P>
Most hardware stores sell low-flow shower heads, which also come with an 
instant-off button for soaping up, or plastic flow restrictor discs that fit 
into your existing head. Some cities supply these items free of charge to 
residents. Check with your City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing your shower head or installing a flow restrictor requires an 8-inch 
adjustable wrench or large pair of pliers. If you use pliers, wrap the jaws 
with a couple layers of plastic tape to protect the finish on the shower head. 
</P>
<P>
You will notice either two flat areas on opposite sides of the shower head 
"neck" where it joins the pipe from the wall, or a knurled collar around the 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
Adjust the wrench or pliers to fit snugly over the neck and turn the tool 
counter-clockwise to loosen the shower head. Continue unscrewing the head by 
hand until it comes off. 
</P>
<P>
Before reattaching either a new low-flow shower head or the old shower head 
with a flow restrictor placed into the threaded recessed area of the neck, 
first seal the threads to prevent leakage. 
</P>
<P>
Moisten an ordinary bar of soap and rub it over all the threads visible at the 
end of the pipe projecting from the wall so that all the spaces between the 
threads are covered with a layer of soap. Then screw the head on as tightly as 
possible by hand and continue tightening with the wrench or pliers until it 
feels snug. 
</P>
<P>
Turn on the water and check for leaks. If water drips from the head/pipe joint, 
further tighten the shower head. 
</P>
<P>
Odds are that initially you will not like the diminished water pressure from 
the low-flow head. 
</P>
<P>
Stick with it, though. Both the water savings and sewer flow reduction are 
quite substantial, and you will get used to it sooner than you think. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us have heard of the idea of saving lots of water by placing a "tank 
dam" or plastic bottle inside a toilet tank (up to 22 gallons a day), but not 
many people realize that a toilet that leaks can waste up to 400 gallons of 
water a month! 
</P>
<P>
Determining if your toilet leaks sometimes requires a careful listening and 
close observation. 
</P>
<P>
Close the bathroom door to block outside sound and listen to your toilet. A 
slight hissing sound from the toilet usually means a leak. 
</P>
<P>
To diagnose the source of the leak, place five to 10 drops of food coloring 
into the tank after it fills up and observe the water in the bowl. If the drain 
ball or flapper at the bottom of the tank is worn, the water in the bowl will 
begin to change to the color of the tank water. 
</P>
<P>
To replace the drain ball, first shut off the water by turning the supply valve 
under the left side of the toilet tank clockwise fully. 
</P>
<P>
Then hold the brass rod the drain ball is attached to with a pair of pliers 
while unscrewing the ball with the other hand. Wear a glove. 
</P>
<P>
To replace a drain flapper, just unhook it from either side of the overflow 
tube and pull it out. Also unhook the chain that goes to the flush handle 
lever. 
</P>
<P>
Any hardware store will have these replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
When installing either the drain ball or flapper, lightly coat the bottom 
surface with Vaseline to create a better seal. 
</P>
<P>
If the food coloring test proves negative, the problem could be that the 
control valve is worn and is allowing so much water into the tank that it is 
spilling into the "overflow tube" that rises in the middle of the tank. 
</P>
<P>
The cure for this is usually bending the float ball rod so the ball sits lower 
in the tank. Grasp the rod with two hands and gradually increase downward 
pressure with your right hand until the rod bends down 1 to 2 inches on the 
right. Test the water level to assure it does not enter the tube again. Adjust 
if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Most manufacturers recommend a water level about 1 inch below the top of the 
overflow tube. However, most toilets work just fine with a lower level in the 
tank, thereby saving water. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, bend the rod further, so that the level in the tank is 2, 3 
or more inches below the top of the tube. Adjust your own level so the toilet 
flushes properly with as little water as possible. 
</P>
<P>
As with reducing shower water volume, reducing toilet water use saves hundreds 
of gallons per month in most households while reducing impact on our sewage 
treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
If you have checked for tank leaks and cured any problems with the control 
valve but still hear a hissing sound, check the float ball in the tank. 
Sometimes the ball will fill with enough water that it does not float high 
enough to fully shut the valve. 
</P>
<P>
To check the ball, unscrew it from the brass rod and shake it. Replace it if 
you hear any water at all. 
</P>
<P>
If you have the type of toilet that requires a jiggle of the flush handle to 
stop it from running after use, you may be able to fix it yourself by first 
observing the action of the drain ball or flapper when the tank is flushed. 
</P>
<P>
If your tank has a drain ball that fails to drop onto its seat without a shake 
of the flush handle, the problem could be that the thin brass rod it is 
attached to is binding in its brackets. 
</P>
<P>
To correct this, clean any rust or corrosion off the rod with steel wool and 
lubricate it with Vaseline. 
</P>
<P>
Drain flappers that fail to close again fully after flushing usually have a 
snagged link in the chain between the drain flapper and the flush lever. If you 
notice this problem, replace the flapper chain with one that has smooth, round 
closed links, rather than twisted wire links, and make sure that the chain is 
adjusted so there is only one-half inch of slack when the flapper is seated on 
the tank bottom. 
</P>
<P>
If, after checking for all these items the toilet is still running, the problem 
may be a defective control valve or drain valve, which will usually require 
professional help. Try these suggestions first, because more than half the time 
the problem can be easily fixed in a few minutes with less than $10 of readily 
available replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, keep the water supply valve under the left side of the tank 
shut except to refill the tank after use to reduce water waste while awaiting 
help. 
</P>
<P>
As with a toilet that leaks or runs, a constantly dripping faucet can also 
waste hundreds of gallons of water a month. 
</P>
<P>
There is a large array of faucets types and styles in residential use, but the 
most common and most easily repaired is a washer-type faucet. 
</P>
<P>
To repair these faucets, start by shutting the water main valve to the house 
or, if they exist, shutting the supply valves under the sink. 
</P>
<P>
Turn the faucet handle so it is somewhere between the "off" and "on" position. 
Remove the faucet handle and the plate at the base of the stem to expose the 
hexagonal wrench pad on the valve stem underneath. Place a wrench on the pad 
and turn it counter-clockwise to loosen it. 
</P>
<P>
Once loose, the valve stem will come out easily by hand. At the end of the stem 
is a black rubber washer, held in place with a screw. 
</P>
<P>
Place the faucet handle back on the end of the stem to hold it while you remove 
the screw and the old washer. From any hardware store buy a faucet repair kit 
and look for a replacement washer of similar size to the old one. 
</P>
<P>
Replace the stem back into the valve body, making sure that it is still 
oriented between "off" and "on." Retighten it snugly, replace the plate and the 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
Before turning the water back on, unscrew the aerator at the end of the spout 
to prevent debris loosened in the shut-off valve from lodging in the aerator 
filter screens. Turn on the water, let it run until clear and replace the 
aerator. 
</P>
<P>
Follow these same procedures to fix leaky hose bib faucets and sprinkler 
valves. Sprinkler valves require oversize washers that most hardware stores 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to reduce water waste from faucets is to simply close the shut-off 
valves under the sink a turn or so clockwise to reduce the water flow to the 
faucet by about half. According to the Santa Monica Department of General 
Services, this can save up to 126 gallons per week for the average household. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles Department of Water and Power studies, most of us tend 
to water too often and leave the sprinklers on too long. They recommend 
watering only every third day, and during early morning or evening hours to 
reduce evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
Water savings for the typical home can be up to 500 gallons a week with this 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But even if you follow this recommendation, you may be wasting water by 
overspray, puddling or improperly aimed heads. Here is advice for solving these 
common sprinkler problems. 
</P>
<P>
Overspray onto sidewalks or onto the house is not only wasteful but can lead to 
costly moisture damage to the paint, stucco and structural members of the 
building. To correct it, turn the brass screw in to center of the sprinkler 
head clockwise until the desired spray volume is reached. 
</P>
<P>
Puddling around the sprinkler head is usually caused by nothing more than 
deflection of the spray by tall grass around the head. Always keep at least an 
8-inch diameter circle of very low cut grass around each head to allow the 
spray to clear. 
</P>
<P>
Correcting improperly aimed sprinklers is very easy. With a large pair of 
pliers or a sprinkler wrench (about $5 at most hardware stores), gently turn 
the entire head so that the spray is directed to the desired area. 
</P>
<P>
If the spray pattern itself is incorrect, the "insert" in the center of the 
head can be replaced to more suitably match the area to be watered. 
</P>
<P>
They are sold to spray one-eighth-, one-quarter-, one-half-, three-quarter- or 
full-circle patterns. Remove your existing insert and take it to most any 
hardware store to find one of the appropriate pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have all your sprinklers operating at peak efficiency, continue 
checking them about once every month or two. Sediment and debris in the pipes 
often causes clogs in the heads, which adversely affect the spray quality. 
</P>
<P>

Before reattaching new shower head, rub wet soap on the threads at the end of 
the pipe to create seal.

<LEADPARA>  THE sound of water running in an unused toilet generally signals a problem
that is fairly easy and inexpensive to repair but costly if ignored.;    Q
Every few hours, my toilet seems to flush itself. I've replaced some parts,
but the flushing continues. What's wrong?  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  TANK-TO-BOWL TOILET LEAK IS A COSTLY WASTE
OF WATER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Home Improvement  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     A The flushing sound from the toilet is probably caused by the tank's
refilling itself after the water has leaked from the tank into the toilet
bowl. A leak of this type can waste thousands of gallons of water in a few
weeks.;    Most tank-to-bowl leaks are caused by a faulty flush valve. To
check, remove the lid from the tank and watch the operation of the mechanism
inside during several flushes.;    The flush valve is at the bottom of the
tank, near the center. In some toilets, it consists of a rubber half-ball on
the end of a rod. When the toilet is flushed with the flush handle, the ball
is raised from its seat, and water rushes through an opening into the bowl.
Some toilets have a flapper type of valve hooked to a chain instead of a ball
and rod, but the principle is the same. In either case, during a flush, the
ball or flapper returns to its seat and plugs the opening after the tank
empties. The empty tank automatically refills with water and is ready for
another flush.;    If the flush valve is malfunctioning, water from the tank
leaks through the opening into the bowl and eventually lowers the water in the
tank to the point where the tank refills again and the process starts over. If
there is a very slow leak, the cycle can take several hours.;    Watching how
a flush works sometimes makes the cause of a flush-valve malfunction obvious.
In a ball-and-rod mechanism, for example, a slightly bent rod might be causing
the ball to hang up on the edge of the seat instead of closing completely. A
slight adjustment to the rod can often correct this problem.;    If the ball
or flapper seems to be seating properly, the seal still can be poor because of
dirt or corrosion on the valve or seat. Feel the mating surfaces and carefully
wipe to remove any debris. If the metal seat is rough or corroded, it can
sometimes be smoothed with steel wool or fine emery paper.;    Flush-valve
leaks also can be caused by holes or cracks in the ball or flapper.
Replacements parts are available at many home centers and hardware stores.;   
...; Q Wallpaper in our den came loose at the seams. What causes this, and how
can we repair it?;    A The usual cause is not enough paste at the edges or
slow application, which lets the paste dry too soon. Loose seams can usually
be repaired with a special adhesive available in tubes at wallpaper stores.
Also buy a seam roller, which has a small wood roller to press down the seams
for better adhesion. Read the instructions on the adhesive container
carefully. One widely sold product, Elmer's Wallcovering Repair Adhesive, is
applied to both the wall and paper surface and allowed to dry before the
surfaces are joined. If the wall surface is very porous, give it two coats of
adhesive before pressing the loose seam to the wall.;    ...; Q The metal
front door of our house was repainted last fall, but the paint blistered and
flaked off during the winter. What went wrong, and how can we get a lasting
paint job?;    A Probably the wrong type of paint was used, or the surface
wasn't properly prepared. Scrape off all blistered paint and sand the surface
thoroughly. Prime any bare spots with an alkyd-base primer or special metal
primer. An alkyd or acrylic enamel or trim paint can be used for the finish
coats, but be certain it is designed for exterior surfaces and is suitable for
use on metal. Use at least two coats of finish paint, sanding lightly after
the first coat.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  YOU'RE wandering through a store looking for a low-flow shower-head or an
energy-saving light bulb. You can't find one, so you ask for help.
Unfortunately, the clerks don't know what you're talking about. And the

<TEXT>     Here's a summer project for anyone who wants to help the environment: Help
turn your local hardware store into an environmental supply center.;    
Conservation facts;    (check)  The United States imports more than 50 percent
of its oil, more than in the oil crisis of the 1970s. Much of this is used to
generate residential electricity -- so making homes more energy-efficient
reduces our dependence on foreign oil and helps the economy.;    (check)  The
average American home wastes much of the energy it consumes. Energy-efficient
household products help cut down emissions responsible for acid rain, the
greenhouse effect and other environmental ills.;    (check)  Surveys show that
90 percent of Americans would rather buy water- and energy-saving products at
a local store than order them by phone or mail.;     Shopping survey;  The
next time you go to a hardware store, check to see how many energy- and
water-saving products it carries. Take notes as you go. If you have any
environmental catalogs, take them along to help you look for specific products
and brand names. Pay attention to how well displayed the products are. Check
the store for these items:;    (check)  Plumbing: low-flow shower-heads (2.5
gallons per minute or less), ultra low-flush toilets, toilet dams and
water-saving faucet aerators.;    (check)  Lighting: compact fluorescent light
bulbs, energy-saving floodlights and energy-efficient outdoor fixtures such as
metal halide, high-pressure sodium or compact fluorescent.;    (check) 
Miscellaneous: water heater insulating jackets, appliance timers, programmable
thermostats, battery rechargers and weatherstripping supplies.;     Hardware
audit;    (check)  List what you were looking for, what the store had and what
it didn't have. Compare the selection with other local hardware stores. Make a
separate list for each store.;    (check)  If one store had a better selection
than the others, let each of the managers know, and tell them that you and
your friends will shop at the store with the best selection. Make good on your
promise -- change your shopping habits.;    (check)  Contact your local energy
or water utility; find out if they offer rebate coupons for conservation
products. If they do, ask them to provide local hardware stores with stand-up
displays. Using rebates makes energy-saving products more affordable.;

<DESCRIPT>  WEATHER; DROUGHT; WATER; CONSERVATION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  RAIN WAS pounding the windows of our little San Francisco Victorian on a
Saturday in late March -- a rare sound in a long drought. Shoot. If I went
jogging, puddles would surely flatten the air-bubbled insoles of my running
shoes. Maybe I'd do laundry instead.;    Roger and I perused the mail: Macy's
bill, letter from Mom, amazing credit-card offer and -- uh oh -- The Official
Notice From The Water Department.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SIX FLUSHES AND YOU'RE OUT -- OF WATER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Renee Koury is a Mercury News staff writer.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Roger tore it open and we both hunched over it to see the tiny
computer-generated numbers that told us how much water we could use for the
next 12 months.;    "Not much," Roger said, tossing the sheet aside. I grabbed
it, looked again, and the reality of the five-year drought sank in for the
first time.;    Our ration of the sapped Hetch Hetchy water supply was a
dribbly 218 gallons a day -- to be shared with the three tenants in our front
house.;    It worked out to 43.6 gallons a person. That was even less than the
notorious 50 gallons-a-person limit for Marin County's parched populace.;    I
looked closer at the numbers. They didn't change. I prayed for biblical rain.
That's what the water czars said we would need to go back to our wonderfully
wicked water-wasting ways.;    "Wait a minute, you realize what 43 gallons
is?" I asked, my voice soft at first but steadily rising to a plaintive whine.
"It means we can't flush the toilet if we wanna take a shower. We can't do the
dishes if I wanna wash my hair. We can't brush our teeth if we wanna do the
laundry. We can't . . .";    There was too much rain to go jogging, but not
nearly enough to do the laundry.;    Baths and hot tubs?;  My co-workers in
the South Bay seemed comparatively unfazed by the drought. This became
apparent one day when a large group went out to lunch. These happy-go-lucky
people were talking about giving kids their baths, planting perennials and
filling their hot tubs. I wondered how I was going to wash my hair that
night.;    If the whole state was in a drought, I thought, how come only some
of us were forced to conserve?;    I decided our water department was to
blame. If Hetch Hetchy hadn't sold water to every county, city and farmer who
asked years ago, we'd have plenty of water for San Franciscans who own the
water system.;    OK, so we usually have a lot more water than we need. And
we've made millions of dollars selling Sierra runoff over the years. And other
places need the water too. But weren't we stretched a little too thin?;    It
also seemed our rationing formula -- based on our water use in 1987 -- was
preposterously obsolete. With the new 45 percent cutback, those of us who'd
always conserved were given a puddle; San Franciscans who nurtured their
bougainvillea and cucumbers in 1987 were getting 150 gallons a day apiece.;   
"Why not just give everyone a flat amount?" I seethed. The water department
asserted the formula is the only feasible way to figure what everyone needs.; 
  Hardware solution;  Roger and I headed to the full-service hardware store on
Clement Street. The friendly clerks there can maneuver through rows of
mystifying metal thingamajiggies to find any household gadget known to man.;  
 "You want what?" asked the crusty clerk with the tobacco-stained smile.
"Low-flow shower heads?" He chuckled, squinted one eye and sucked a drag off a
cigarette. Then he wound through the musty aisles, with us following like
puppies, until we reached the bathroom-fixtures display. He pointed to a wall
of empty hooks.;    "I guess it's a no-go on the low-flow," he said, coughing
out a hearty laugh. "We were all outa those a long time ago. Next shipment'll
be in three weeks."; (hbox);    Most people use about 150 gallons a day. It
takes 43 gallons to flush the toilet six times or take a five-minute
normal-flow shower. If we did either one of those, we couldn't turn on the tap
for the rest of the day.;    Roger and I visited our three tenants to explain
we were truly in a drought. If we used more than our share, we'd have to pay a
big fine and eventually they would shut off our water altogether.;    The
tenants stared silently. "I don't want to pay a fine just so you can do your
laundry," one of them declared.;    True, we have a washing machine that uses
55 gallons for one load and they go down the street to the laundromat.;    We
decided not to do the laundry unless we skipped two days' worth of showers.;  
 Mutual monitoring;  But the rigid rations created a new air of suspicion as
the five of us embarked secretly on a mission of mutual monitoring.;    A
tenant peered out her window to watch as I hauled a load of laundry to the
basement. I paused under their kitchen window counting gallons as they washed
their dishes.;    Even Roger and I started snapping at each other as we
suddenly focused on each other's water-wasting tendencies.;    "Why are you
turning the water on?" I shouted first thing one morning. He had just flipped
on the bathroom faucet and was rummaging through the medicine chest to find
his toothbrush.;    "Oh. Sorry. It's just habit," he said, twisting the faucet
shut while he continued his search.;    I got up in the middle of the night to
go to the bathroom. He awoke and shouted: "Don't flush the toilet!" I snapped
to attention.;    "It was reflex," I said, sinking into guilty dreams of
wallowing in water.;    Soon we started planning our toilet flushes, realizing
that each time we pushed the handle it cost us seven precious gallons. Roger
and I set aside our pride and let the contents pile up until it smelled like
the cat box. Then we flushed without remorse.;    Last week, we put away our
china and filled our cupboards with paper plates. It saved a lot of
dishwashing, but burdened us with the guilt of contributing more to the
landfill crisis.;    We also realized that we were wasting several gallons
each morning by running the bathtub water until it turned hot. So we put a big
pot into the bathroom and used it to catch the "heat-up" water. Brilliant,
right? Except that the pot was too heavy to lift out of the tub. Both of us
stood there pulling and grunting, and feeling like we were in a Mack Sennett
silent movie.;    So we started filling the pot only halfway. It was still
comical; we'd run with it into the kitchen and dash back into the heated
shower. Later we would use the rescued water to steam vegetables, wash dishes
and water plants.;    One day my girlfriend from Oakland, where water is
plentiful, visited our drought wizened house. When she saw our big pot of
captured "heat-up" water, she stared at me as though I'd suddenly shaved half
of my head and dyed the other half green.;    "You save your water?" she said
in a low voice. "I do four loads of laundry a day. I stand in the shower as
long as I want. How come we live a few miles apart and I have as much water as
I want and you guys have so little?";    Good question. It reminded me of so
many other times that family and friends had pointed out San Francisco's
shortcomings. "There's no parking in the city!" "You have too many hills to
ride your bike." "Aren't you petrified of earthquakes?";    Now the drought.
Is this just another quirk that gives San Francisco its character? Or is it
time to move on?;    Well, we had survived so far on our cramped, hilly,
fault-ridden terrain. And now the water board is to meet Tuesday to decide
whether to give us more water.;    If March storms dumped enough snow in the
Sierra, and if the snowmelt is running into our reservoirs, and if we'd have
enough water for next year, then they may raise our rations.;    We'd be
rolled back just 25 percent. A mere inconvenience. Just think. We could use
real china, take a shower every day, do laundry once a week, flush almost
every time . . .  (box)  </TEXT>

   Far from making jokes about European plumbing
arrangements, Americans are now growing interested in fixtures from
overseas, according to the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Information
Bureau.
   One of the reasons is the design itself, says Linda Mayer, the
Kohler Co.'s marketing director. ``In good design, form follows
functions, and Europeans do a good job at both,'' she says.
European fixtures tend to be more rounded and come in interesting
shapes, some with Art Deco flavor.
   Thompson Price, a designer and president of the National Kitchen
&amp; Bath Association, says the European look uses rounded, gentle
curves which follow the contour of the body. ``Traditional American
fixture and faucet design tends to be more angular, with more
straight lines. Form follows function rather than aesthetics.''
   In recent years, major American fixture manufacturers have gone
into joint ventures with European companies to add some continental
finesse to their lines. Eljer, for example, has contracted with
Swedish, French and Italian groups, while Kohler Co. recently
acquired a French maker, Jacob Delafon. And the German firm, Ideal
Standard, is part of the American Standard corporate family.
   ``During the past several years, American manufacturers have
made great strides in adapting the `Eurostyle' look to domestic
bathroom products,'' says David L. Weiner, the PHCIC's executive
director. ``In turn, European manufacturers, particularly faucet
producers, have done a good job in cracking the American market.''
   The faucets have a soft, rounded look and often are colored.
Perhaps more importantly, they`re quieter. ``Europeans are very
sensitive to the noise made by their faucets,'' says Don Arnold, an
industry consultant. ``They have strict regulations on faucet
operating noise. American faucets would never pass these
regulations.''
   European makers are courting the U.S. customer. Joey Von Korff,
sales and marketing director for the Europe-based Villeroy &amp; Boch,
says that ``Americans are enthusiastic about our designs and
colors, and they appreciate our superior quality. Our plan is to
continue to build consumer awareness of our products.''
   But American firms still dominate the U.S. market, says Mayer.
``Fixtures are difficult to import, and they're priced higher than
domestic brands.''
   Major differences that may not translate well for the American
market are toilets and bidets. Scott Atcheson, Eljer's fixtures
product manager, points out that European toilets are not what
Americans are used to at home. ``European toilets are all super
water savers, using as little as 1.5 gallons per flush. Regulations
on water usage are stricter there than in the U.S.,'' he says.
``Although low-consumption toilets are now on the scene in this
country, the American consumer is still accustomed to a good strong
toilet flush.''
   And bidets in this country may be considered more a status
symbol than a necessity, adds Price. ``Europeans, on average, take
only about three baths per week as compared to seven or more for
Americans,'' he says. ``Europeans couldn't do without the bidet.''

   Suffering From a Lack of Water,
   They Start Plumbing the Depths

   Fish don't normally float in toilet bowls until they're
off to meet their Maker.
   But commodes soon may make cozy homes for marine life,
thanks to some ecologically minded officials in Southern
California who want to dump old water-guzzling toilets into
the Pacific Ocean.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Worried about the state's continuing drought, water
districts have been urging residents to install
ultralow-flush toilets to save water; some districts are even
offering rebates to residents who switch. But that has led to
another environmental dilemma as the older toilets are dumped
into already backed-up landfills.
   So the bureaucrats came up with the idea for toilet-bowl
reefs.
   "Porcelain fixtures are just as good as rock as far as the
fish are concerned. They're funny-shaped devices with lots of
places for them to hide," says John Grant, a marine biologist
with the U.S. Department of Fish and Game, which is
considering proposals from the city of Santa Monica and the
Helix Water District near San Diego to dump toilets into
Santa Monica Bay and off Point Loma, San Diego. He says a
pile of 300 commodes dumped illegally into Santa Monica Bay a
few years ago has become "a great place to dive for
lobsters."
   Harold Ball, president of the Helix Water District, says
toilets would make ideal reefs for the very reason they're
terrible in landfills: "A toilet literally lasts forever. . .
. It's identical material to a dinner plate. When they went
down to the Titanic, they found the dinner plates were in
perfect condition."
   Flush with suggestions for getting rid of old toilets,
Helix Water District is also testing a plan to crush commodes
and use them to fill potholes. Goleta Water District, near
Santa Barbara, which abandoned the idea of a toilet-bowl reef
because of cost and other issues, is using ground-up toilets
as roadbed.
   With artificial reefs already made of sunken ships, old
cars and rubber tires, "I can't see why using those toilets
wouldn't be very acceptable," says James Stewart, a diving
safety officer with Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La
Jolla, Calif.
   Even so, officials are bracing for a swirl of controversy
over their toilet-bowl reefs. "If you look at it
aesthetically, there are some troubling aspects," concedes
Fish and Game's Mr. Grant. Though giant kelp would camouflage
the commodes in a matter of years, "There's still a stigma
attached to a toilet bowl."

"Three, two, one . . ." a reporter intoned.

<P>
And then, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter pulled the lever on a 
toilet that was stationed outside the Department of Water and Power building 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
As the machine flushed its water out through a specially attached hose Friday, 
conscientious radio and television reporters gallantly thrust their microphones 
inside the white ceramic bowl to illustrate its relatively quiet thrust. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful exhibition was staged to unveil an ultralow-flush toilet, which 
swallows just 1.6 gallons of water at a time, about half of what a standard 
toilet uses. A city ordinance mandates that, beginning July 1, all new and/or 
replaced residential toilets must be of the low-flush variety. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said that she expects about 250,000 such toilets installed in the 
first year, which would save an estimated 476 million gallons of water. That's 
enough water, her staff pointed out, to fill the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 
four times over. And, perhaps, wash the Raiders out of town.

</P>
<P>
The headstone of the 19th-Century Downey resident disappeared from a local 
cemetery last year, but Ed Lewis and the Greenleaf 4-H club have come to the 
rescue. They're constructing a duplicate -- a 2 1/2-foot-tall redwood marker 
that will bear the original painted inscription: 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good Indian while he lived. He belonged to the Kaweah. He lived in 
Downey 22 years and died November 22, 1895." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he's making this marker longer so that it can sit deeper in the 
cement. "Last time it was in cement, too, and they (the thieves) just dug the 
whole thing out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, who died at about the age of 55, was something of a local medicine man who 
shared his home remedies with local residents, said Joyce Lawrence of the 
Downey Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
In an obituary on Joe, a Downey newspaper noted that he lived his last years 
outdoors. Once he had lived in a shed near the tracks of the Southern Pacific 
Railroad, the article said, but after a storm blew the shed down on him, he 
"could never be induced to sleep under a roof again."

<P>
In Southern California, you can find valet parking for everything from movie 
premieres and the Beverly Hills post office to barbecued ribs joints.

Now comes an event so big that a $5 valet charge is being assessed drivers --

   A judge declared a mistrial in a drug trial
when three jurors made an unauthorized visit to the alleged crime
scene to see how long it took a toilet to flush.
   This particular privy was supposed to be private.
   ``I'm hard pressed not to use the analogy, flushed down the
toilet,'' Superior Judge Robert Bradley said in declaring the
mistrial Tuesday in the case against Nelson Cortez, of Oxnard.
   The jury foreman told the judge the panelists visited an
apartment rented by co-defendant Joel Ruvalcaba to test the truth of
Cortez' testimony.
   Cortez had testified he was awakened by the sound of a toilet
flushing on Jan. 14, 1988, went into the bathroom and was
immediately arrested by waiting police after officers found a bag of
cocaine in the bowl.
   Cortez claimed he didn't know how the drug got in the toilet.
   Ruvalcaba, meanwhile, was arrested in the living room.
   Two jurors tried flushing their own toilets at home to see if
Cortez would have had enough time to get up, go to the bathroom and
get arrested all in the flush of a toilet.
   Not satisfied with the home experiments, three jurors went to the
apartment building on a lunch break last week, posed as prospective
renters to gain access to Ruvalcaba's former apartment and timed the
toilet flush.
   The judge said he had to declare the mistrial because the
apartment visit was ``serious misconduct.'' Jurors had been told not
to visit the crime scene.
   The panel was allowed to continue to deliberate the fate of
Ruvalcaba.

<HL> Technology: California Town Enlists House Builders To Implement Water Conservation Plan </HL>
<AUTHOR> Bill Paul (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<IN> CON </IN>
<TEXT>
   In a program with national implications, a small California town is requiring contractors to retrofit existing houses with water-saving devices before issuing building permits for new houses. 

   Like many U.S. communities, the south-central California town of Morro Bay, population 10,000, is chronically short of fresh water because it depends on shallow ground-water basins. 
Its program aims to save as much water in older residences as new houses can be expected to use. 

   Thus, officials now require contractors to buy and install at their own expense water-saving toilets, shower heads and faucets in at least 10 houses for every new house they build. 
Each package of water-saving devices cuts a household's water use by roughly 20%, which translates into lower monthly water bills for those owners who volunteer for the retrofit. 

   While a number of states and cities, including Massachusetts and Los Angeles, either have or are about to impose water-efficiency standards for new construction, Morro Bay is believed to be the first town in the U.S. to make enhanced water efficiency in existing houses a prerequisite for building a new house. 

   James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in Washington, thinks the idea could catch on wherever water supplies are tight. 
In his opinion, "Mayors and city commissioners will see this as {politically} easier than bond issues and raising property taxes" for improvements to the local water-supply system. 

   Mr. Christian further says Morro Bay appears to be part of a more-general developing trend that has contractors being asked to spend their own money on municipal improvements, particularly roads, before getting a permit to build. 
Mr. Christian says he wouldn't be surprised if, one day soon, contractors are even subsidizing improvements to town dumps. 

   So far, according to Morro Bay associate planner David Bugher, one-third of the town's 5,000 houses, as well as more than 400 motel rooms and 29 commercial establishments, have been retrofitted, resulting in building permits being issued for about 150 new houses. 

   At a cost to the contractor of roughly $200 a house, including installation, Morro Bay house owners are getting for free a package that includes a toilet that uses just 3.5 gallons a flush, or half the average of most toilets. 
The package also includes a shower head that uses only three gallons of water a minute, compared with the average head that uses five to eight gallons a minute. 

   The toilet's efficiency stems from a shallower trap. 
The shower head has smaller holes plus aerating vents that suck in air and blow it out with the water stream, giving the effect of higher water volume than is actually used. 

   To be sure, more-efficient toilets, using just 1.5 gallons a flush, are on the market, and are even the standard in Massachusetts. 
But while that would increase the water saving to 25%, Mr. Bugher says the 1.5-gallon toilet has a "perception problem" with local residents, who, he says, just don't see how it can work. (The 1.5-gallon model has an even shallower trap.) 

   Given that new houses currently sell for $200,000 to $300,000 each, Mr. Bugher adds that a contractor doesn't have much trouble passing through to the new-house buyer the additional $1,000 or so cost for water retrofitting.

   Lighter Cars' `Fluff'
   Fouls Up Scrappers

<TEXT>
   CUTTING cars' environmental costs is complicated by a
solid-waste issue.
   Lightening up cars has been one way to raise their fuel
efficiency, saving oil and lessening air pollution. Further
efficiency gains probably will require more substitution of
relatively light plastic parts for metal ones in cars.
Therein lies the rub: More plastic means more "fluff."
   That's the nonmetal stuff that remains after cars are
shredded and their metal parts are salvaged. Car scrappers
send fluff to landfills. In some regions, skyrocketing
landfill costs, coupled with the shrinking amount of
profitable metal in junked cars, threaten to force scrappers
out of business, says Thomas Byro, a fluff specialist at the
Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries in Washington. "That
could be an environmental catastrophe," because shredders
grind up some nine million U.S. cars a year that otherwise
might be left to litter the landscape, leaking oil and other
toxins into ground water.
   One solution may be to make cars lighter by using more
aluminum, which scrappers love. But auto design experts say
that could make cars too costly. Mr. Byro is studying a
cheaper idea that entails separating fluff's organic parts,
including plastics, from glass and metallic fragments. Car
scrappers could sell the former as burnable fuel and the
latter as a cement ingredient, he hopes.
   In Europe, policy makers are pressuring car makers to help
find ways to recycle fluff, says Ibis Associates, a
Wellesley, Mass., consultant that advises auto makers.
Innovations are emerging to do that, such as microwaving
fluff to break it down into reusable parts. But making the
new methods cost-effective may be difficult, Ibis says.
                                                                                                       

   Cheap Retrofit Kits
   Save Toilet Water
                                                                                                       

   ATTENTION Southern Californians: You don't have to pay
$200 for a low-flush toilet to save a lot of water.
   Cheap flush-control devices are proliferating to cut older
toilets' water use. They fit most models and can save much
more water than a brick in the tank can, says Thomas Babcock,
a Phoenix water department official who tests the devices.
There are two main kinds: early-closure flappers and
dual-flush devices.
   The flappers, which cut off water flow early during a
flush, are the simpler and cheaper alternative. Frugal Flush
of Phoenix claims its $15.95 flapper, which it sells through
plumbing-supply wholesalers, can cut older, five-gallon
flushers' water use by 50%.
   Dolphin Engineering, North Chelmsford, Mass., offers a
similar device by mail in a $21.95 kit that includes shower
and faucet attachments to conserve water.
   The dual-flush alternative provides for small flushes of
less than three gallons and also regular-sized flushes, which
help alleviate "line clogging," says Kim Hout, Colorado water
conservation coordinator. She's helping to arrange a Colorado
test of a dual-flush retrofit kit made by ConTech Industries,
Creswell, Ore. It retails for $24.95 and comes with an
install-it-yourself, two-part handle, new flapper and other
parts. U.S. AquaTec, Mesa, Ariz., also offers a $29.95
dual-flush kit, whose handle pushes up for big flushes and
down for small ones.
                                                                                                       

   Taking the Mystery
   Out of Composters
                                                                                                       

   THE U.S. WASTE stream could be cut by 25% if people
composted their food and yard wastes.
   But how to do it without a big mess? Send away for a $200
rotating drum composter? Or settle for a $20 wire-and-plastic
bin?
   Composting experts say the costly rotating devices work
fast, turning leaves and grass into fertilizer-like material
within a few weeks. But they represent overkill for most
people. "What you really want is a simple container, vented
at the bottom and with a cover to prevent sunlight from
killing the bacteria" that break down compostables, says
Robert Beachy of Toro, the lawnmower maker.
   The trouble is, he adds, most commercially sold bins for
composting are too small. "We did experiments, and it took a
critical mass" of at least 12.5 bushels for composting to
work right. A cube three feet on a side would do.
   Carl Woestendiek, who manages Seattle's Solid Waste
Utility backyard composting program, says size seems less
important than putting in the right 50-50 mix of
high-nitrogen waste, such as grass, and high-carbon waste,
such as leaves. He adds that a composter the size of a large
trash can breaks down yard wastes in 12 to 18 months. But
putting in food wastes, he warns, may attract vermin.
   An "intriguing" potential solution to that problem, he
adds, is the $79.95 Green Cone, a closed, sun-heated
composter just introduced by Eco Atlantic, Baltimore. He's
testing one in his yard and says it has worked well so far.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   NEW SELF-STICK labels developed by Adhesives Research,
Glen Rock, Pa., may help solve a recycling headache. Most
label adhesives gum up paper recycling machines, forcing many
recyclers to shun envelopes and other paper with the labels.
Adhesives Research claims it has developed a long-adhering,
water-soluble glue for labels that doesn't mess up the
machines. Several label-using companies are mulling a switch
to the new labels, including newspaper publishers. . . . A
recycling museum is being planned by Boston Turns 2000, a
nonprofit group developing projects to show the city's
positive side. The museum would travel on a barge and would
include exhibits such as art made with recycled materials and
a demonstration of paper recycling, says a group spokesman.
The museum's cafe would serve soups made from leftovers.

The Santa Monica City Council on Tuesday night agreed to impose additional 
emergency water conservation measures -- including limiting the watering of 
lawns to twice a week and encouraging a voluntary 10% reduction in water usage 
from last year's level -- with the hope of avoiding water rationing. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope to help residents achieve the 10% cut in water usage by 
providing free low-flow shower heads and faucet aerators for kitchens and 
bathrooms, free inspections of lawns to determine watering needs, free 
adjustments to automatic irrigation systems, and free inspections for leaks for 
customers whose water consumption exceeds last year's use by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency conservation measures, which become effective next week, will be 
temporary and will continue until the City Council determines that emergency 
drought conditions have subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the City Council imposed many water conservation measures. Among 
those are measures that prohibit watering lawns between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., 
hosing down patios or driveways more than once a week, and running water from 
hoses while washing cars. Also made permanent were requirements to immediately 
repair all leaks from exterior and interior pipes and for all restaurants to 
serve water only upon request. 
</P>
<P>
The additional conservation measures approved Tuesday will limit the watering 
of lawns to twice a week and impose a complete ban on the hosing down of 
driveways and patios. Swimming pools will not be allowed to be filled or 
emptied, unless it is the first filling of a newly constructed pool or if 
required repair work on a leak was performed. 
</P>
<P>
The city will hire two inspectors to enforce the conservation laws, inspect 
homes for retrofitting of low-flow toilets and shower heads, and do public 
outreach for the conservation programs. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat violators of the measures face a surcharge on their water bills of $20 
or 20% of their bimonthly water bill, whichever is higher, or a fine of up to 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
Residents also will receive written notification on their water bills of their 
monthly consumption compared to the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
City Conservation Coordinator Atossa Soltani said the restrictions are designed 
to minimize the effect of the drought and the possible need for rationing next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Santa Monica became the first California city to impose 
fines on residential property owners who do not install low-flow plumbing 
fixtures in existing residences. 
</P>
<P>
Low-flow toilets use a maximum of 1.6 gallons per flush and low-flow shower 
heads limit flow to three gallons per minute. 
</P>
<P>
After July 1, owners of single-family homes who have not complied will have $1 
a month added to their water bills, and owners of multifamily buildings will be 
charged 65 cents each month per unit. Commercial properties are not affected. 
</P>
<P>
All residents will be charged the fine through their water bill until the new 
fixtures are inspected and verified by city officials. Money collected from the 
fine -- the city calls it a "conservation incentive fee" -- will be used to 
finance the city's Baysaver program, which includes $100 rebates per bathroom 
for property owners who install the low-flow plumbing fixtures.

<HEAD>Plumbers Celebrate Opening of Chicago Museum Exhibit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The movers and shakers in the world of plumbing
and wastewater treatment celebrated the opening Wednesday of a new
museum exhibit illustrating the plumber's role as guardian of the
nation's health.
   ``The average person flushes the closet and (they) don't know
what happens to the water. They don't realize what's all involved
in plumbing,'' said William Reichert, chairman of the Chicago
Plumbing Council.
   ``Our motto is, the plumbers protect the health of the nation.
The doctors take care of it _ but we protect it,'' said Reichert,
who began as an apprentice plumber in 1926 and now is president of
a local plumbing and heating company.
   About 200 people, many of them plumbing contractors, plumbing
inspectors or plumbing engineers, crowded into the new
2,200-square-foot exhibit at Chicago's Museum of Science and
Industry.
   The exhibit illustrates the flow of water in the Chicago area
from Lake Michigan through treatment plants, into the home, out the
toilet and into sewage treatment plants.
   Instead of the traditional ribbon-cutting, Mayor Eugene Sawyer
did the honors at a pipe-cutting ceremony, working up a sweat
slicing the pipe as some of the plumbers' wives snapped pictures.
   ``I've just earned my plumbing (union) card again,'' Sawyer
quipped. ``I used to be a member of the Plumbers Union because I
started out in the Water Department as a chemist.
   ``I understand how important it is that we in Chicago have clean
water,'' the mayor said.
   Reichert, proudly showing off the exhibit, said it was a tribute
to the plumber's role in modern society.
   The first section features seven animated transparencies showing
how the city's water system provides more than 1 billion gallons of
water daily to more than 7 million people.
   The next section, a series of full-scale cutaway rooms in a
house, features glass pipes instead of steel or cast iron, showing
how water flows through the kitchen, bathroom and laundry room.
   ``When you flush the closet, it shows how the closet works and
where the water goes,'' Reichert said. ``It's interesting. If you
have kids, you can bring them down and show them.''
   He pointed to a bend inside the bottom of the toilet, just
before the point where the water flows out, and noted that's where
most blockages occur.
   Reichert paused before a glass display case containing a fat,
two-foot chunk of weathered wood.
   ``Way back in Chicago in the 1800s, we had wooden water mains.
When they dug the subway they uncovered some of these,'' he said.
   ``And here's an old-time closet with a wooden tank like they had
way back when,'' Reichert said, pointing out an older model of
toilet.
   The final section of the exhibit is a walk-through theater
describing the history and wastewater treatment responsibilities of
the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Chicago.
   Frank Mucha of Chicago, a museum visitor, was among the first to
view the new exhibit.
   ``I think it's very nice. It's interesting and educational.''
   Mucha confessed he'd never given much thought to what happens
when the commode is flushed.
   ``I never paid any attention to it in the past. I had no idea
what happened.''

   Amtrak is on a fast track to criminal court
after refusing to stop flushing toilet waste from trains.
   State Attorney John Tanner, who filed littering charges against
the passenger railroad, had offered to drop the three misdemeanor
counts if Amtrak agreed to stop dumping from trains passing over two
overwater trestles.
   But Amtrak, whichhas been dumping along its right of way under a
federal law that railroads have been using for more than a century,
contends federal law overrides state and local law. Clifford Black,
an Amtrak spokesman at its Washington headquarters, said Florida
risks losing service if it presses the case.
   An arraignment was scheduled Sept. 18. The charges carry fines of
up to $5,000 each.
   Amtrak's 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the
contents of 30-gallon holding tanks when the trains are traveling at
least 35 mph.
   Tanner tried to halt the practice only over the two trestles.
   Black said agreeing to Tanner's conditions would make Amtrak a
target for similar demands over every body of water in Florida.
``With the myriad waterways in Florida, it would be an impossible
situation,'' he said Monday.
   The railroad hopes to replace much of its fleet with new cars
equipped with holding tanks for all toilets. Black said it would
cost $147 million to install those tanks on the current fleet.
   Amtrak fears having to hire a worker to stand in each car to
throw an override switch for toilets when the trains cross bodies of
water, Black said.
   Tanner said Amtrak is bluffing and could not afford to cut back
service in Florida or the Western states _ Oregon, Washington, Utah,
California and Nevada _ where it has also come under fire for its
sanitary habits.
   Black said that the criminal case is the only one of its kind
against Amtrak of which he is aware. Two civil cases are pending in
Oregon, he said.

<TEXT>
   Amtrak pleaded innocent Monday, via
facsimile machine, to charges that it illegally flushes
passenger-car toilets and sewage tanks when its trains cross Florida
waterways, where fishermen have been sprayed.
   The transmission of the pleas to Circuit Judge Robert Perry
quickly ended an arraignment, said Assistant State Attorney Paul
Meredith. The judge scheduled a Nov. 2 hearing for pre-trial motions.
   Amtrak has threatened to halt service in Florida.
   The plea was entered after Amtrak earlier rejected a settlement
offer from State Attorney John Tanner, who promised to drop three
charges of commercial dumping if Amtrak would stop all flushing
while its trains cross trestles over creeks and rivers in his
judicial district.
   Amtrak, which has been dumping along its tracks under a federal
law dating back more than a century, said it can't do that because
it would set a precedent.
   The federal law permits the railway to flush toilets along its
right-of-way, and federal law overrides state and local regulations,
Amtrak contends.
   Amtrak has also come under fire in several Western states for its
sanitary habits, but Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said this is
the first complaint filed in a criminal court.
   Amtrak had threatened to suspend service in Florida if Tanner
pressed his case, but Tanner said Amtrak was bluffing.
   ``We hope we won't have to suspend service to Florida,'' said
Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin in Washington, D.C. ``But we are
between a rock and a hard place and we certainly do not want to
continue this public embarrassment. We do not want to be accused of
committing a felony every day.''
   Tanner filed the misdemeanor counts after getting complaints from
people who said they were sprayed with raw sewage while fishing
beneath trestles in the Palatka area of northeastern Florida. Tanner
said the charges would be dropped if Amtrak agreed to stop dumping
over Rice Creek, a tributary of the St. Johns River, and in the
river itself.
   Black said agreeing to Tanner's conditions would have made Amtrak
a target for similar demands from anyone else wanting to stop
dumping in any body of water in Florida.
   Amtrak's passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the
contents of 30-gallon holding tanks along the tracks when the trains
are traveling at least 35 mph.
   The company hopes eventually to replace much of its fleet with
cars that would have holding tanks for all toilets. Black said it
would cost $147 million to install those tanks on the current fleet.

<P>
After six months of efforts to encourage voluntary water conservation in 
Anaheim resulted in just a 1% reduction in water use, the city Utility 
Department next month will begin an aggressive new water-saving program with 
possible financial rebates for residents. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to cut water waste in the city by 10% in the next two years 
under the plan, saving the city up to $1 million, some of which may be passed 
on to water users. 
</P>
<P>
"People start out with very good intentions, but the little good habits we 
build seem to go out the window when the extreme conditions come along," said 
Ray Merchant, a spokesman for the city utility department. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for residents to install low-flush toilets and high-efficiency 
shower heads, which combined can save at least 30 gallons of water per person 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives, such as a possible $75 to $100 rebate for installing the 
water-saving toilet, would also be offered to encourage residents' 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
The Utility Department also hopes to encourage businesses to participate by 
using recycled water when possible in commercial and industrial operations, and 
by reducing the amount of water used for landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Two new Utility Department staff members will be hired to administer the 
program, which will be jointly funded by the city, the Metropolitan Water 
District and the county Sanitation District of Orange County, with each entity 
paying $120,000 toward the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting water use could result in savings of up to $1 million in fees from the 
Metropolitan Water District and the county Sanitation District. However, the 
Metropolitan Water District can fine the city up to $550,000 if it fails to cut 
water use by 5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that these programs -- though they will have short-term effects -- 
will be long-term programs," said Merchant. "We're still not talking about 
mandatory conservation. But we're talking about doing what we can now so that 
if it becomes mandatory, it won't be severe." LISA MASCARO

<LEADPARA>  Late at night, while their owners are sound asleep, thousands of little
gadgets turn themselves on and let the water run. And run. And run.;    They
usually unleash the torrent around 2 a.m., when no one will notice the
swooshing and sloshing down the drain.  </LEADPARA>

LET LOOSE THOUSANDS OF GALLONS
WATER SOFTENERS FLUSH TORRENT DOWN THE DRAIN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The water-loving culprits aren't gremlins. They are automatic water
softening systems. And water officials estimate that they are responsible for
wasting at least a half-million gallons every night in homes throughout the
Santa Clara Valley, enough in one night to supply three average families for a
year.;    There are tens of thousands of automatic water softeners being used
throughout the South Bay: not the little charcoal faucet attachments, but the
big tanks that sit in garages and laundry rooms. Most are in homes. But many
offices and restaurants also use the devices, which remove calcium, magnesium
and other particles from hard water to make it taste better and to keep it
from leaving ugly deposits in sinks and tubs.;    But that is a luxury that
officials at the Santa Clara Valley Water District say they can no longer
afford.; "We'll be asking people to turn them off this year," said Teddy Morse
of the Santa Clara Valley Water District. "The water . . . won't taste the
same. But (the softeners) use an awful lot of water.";    Just how much?
Thirty-five to 120 gallons every time the systems need to be flushed. In most
homes, it's every three days. In some homes, restaurants and offices, it's
every night.;    The request to abandon water softeners comes just when water
will be tasting its worst because more of it will be pumped from underground
wells.;    The large amounts of water are used when the softeners "regenerate"
-- using a saltwater solution to clean the resin bead filters that collect the
bad-tasting particles. This cleaning process is automatic, set by a timer for
the wee hours of the morning, when there is little water demand. Then, the tap
typically runs for an hour or more.;    Water mystery;    Just how much water
runs through softeners has caught some people by surprise.;    Two months ago,
Dave Mendoza tried to add up how much water he and his wife used each day.
They counted the toilet flushes, the showers, the dishwasher, the two weekly
loads of laundry.;    "It didn't add up. Our water bill said we were using
hundreds of gallons more than we thought," said Mendoza, who lives in San
Jose. "Then a neighbor told us it was our water softener.";    Mendoza
discovered the 7-year-old system used 50 gallons every other day. The Mendozas
have since shut it off.;    "The water doesn't taste as good," he said, "but
we're saving $30 a month on our water bill.";    Water softener manufacturers
are quick to defend their products.;    'Health is more important';  "People
look at it this way: The family's health is more important than the fine for
using too much water," said Mari Lynn Johnson, manager of Eco Water Servisoft
in San Jose, which rents 6,000 softeners and sells about 1,200 each year.
"It's not as bad as they make it sound.";    Water officials and consumer
advocates reply that, while the softeners may improve taste, they aren't
designed to remove harmful contaminants.;    "Actually, they send too much
salt to the sewage treatment plants," said Pat Ferraro, a water board member.
"The salt will eventually become as important an issue as how much water they
use." An average water softener uses six pounds of salt each regeneration
cycle.;    To keep water-watching customers from turning away from water
softeners, some companies have come up with plans to clean the resin beads at
water plants, so people don't have to use their home water allotments to flush
the purifiers.;    Installs flow restricters;  Johnson said her company
installs water flow restricters such as low-flow shower heads to make up for
the water used to clean the systems that it sells.;    "We dread having people
shut everything off because they are wasting water," said Pam Workman of Rayne
Water Conditioning Systems, which has 14,000 customers in the San Jose area.
"There are alternatives.";    In response to the drought, Rayne has developed
a water softener that uses only 12 gallons per regeneration flush. But few
other companies have followed suit.;    The Santa Clara Valley Water District
advises people with water softeners to shut them off for the duration of the
drought. If they can't stomach the water, the district is requesting that
people try to reduce the timing of their softener flushing cycles to once a
week or less.;     THE PROCESS; This is how a water softener works:;
(box)Mineral-rich "hard" water flows through a tank filled with resin beads,
which remove the minerals and other particles.; (box)The particle-free "soft"
water flows directly to outlets in the home or business.; (box)As the resin
beads remove the minerals, they slowly get saturated with "hard" material.
They must be cleaned every few days so they can continue to grip onto
particles. This is done by running saltwater through the resin.; (box)After
the saltwater cleanses the beads, it runs down the drain.;  HOW MUCH DO THEY
FLUSH?; Here is about how much water selected automatic water softening
systems use each time they clean the resin filters after 1,000 gallons of
water have been purified. The frequency of flushing varies with household
water use but is generally every one to three days.; Type of softener

<DESCRIPT>  DISEASE; CAUSE; RESEARCH  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Charles Gerba knows exactly where his research will put him: in front of a
toilet, head down in the bowl.;    He's investigated airplane toilets -- "I
almost swallowed my equipment." He's explored gas station toilets -- "They
were so awful, I almost lost my scientific curiosity." But his career is built
on the toilets in people's homes.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SECRET AGENT OF DISEASE LURKS IN THE BATHROOM,
SCIENTIST SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, is the man
who can tell you in great detail what happens to your bathroom every time you
flush.;    "A very fine aerosol spray is ejected," he says, enthusiastically,
between sips of coffee. "You don't see it, or feel it, but it fills the room.
So, if your toothbrushes are out, you may end up brushing your teeth with
material you thought had gone down the toilet.";    As part of his research,
Gerba, who keeps his toothbrush in the medicine cabinet, visited a series of
residential bathrooms and placed glass dishes throughout them. He filled the
dishes with a thin gel on which bacteria and viruses grow. Then he flushed the
toilet. The dishes were soon blooming with micro-organisms.;    "We repeated
the experiment by putting a virus that mice are susceptible to in the toilet
bowls and putting caged mice in the bathrooms," Gerba said. "They all became
ill with that virus after we flushed the toilet. Except for those above six
feet. In both cases, the spray clearly did not reach above six feet.";    His
interest is in public health. Gerba says he suspects that illnesses such as
colds and influenza could be drastically reduced if people understood what
germ factories exist in their homes. In fact, one study of more than 200 homes
found that 91 percent contained micro-organisms that cause skin and eye
infections, pneumonia and meningitis. Eighty percent contained bacteria that
may cause intestinal illness.;    During a recent visit to Sacramento, Gerba
said an increasing number of scientists are coming to believe that the
presence of viruses and bacteria on household surfaces, such as bathroom and
kitchen counter tops, may play a major role in the spread of disease.;   
Recent studies even suggest that touching a contaminated surface is much more
likely to bring on a cold than being exposed to a sneeze. One U.S. Army
experiment involved keeping soldiers inside a barracks. Those with colds could
not touch surfaces used by healthy people. Even though the group shared the
same air -- filled with sneezes and coughs -- none of the healthy soldiers
came down with a cold.;    Gerba recommends that bathrooms and kitchens be
disinfected weekly, using a chemical disinfectant.;    "Wiping with a rag just
isn't enough," Gerba said. "All you do is spread the germs out in a thin layer
of water, which is exactly where they like to live anyway."  </TEXT>

tolerates heat, withstands wear and tear, is disease-resistant, out-competes
weeds. Aerate in spring so water penetrates. Apply pre-emergent herbicide. Use
slow- release fertilizer lightly to encourage root development and keep lawn
healthy but not fast growing. Mow to height of 2 inches. Water weekly early in
the morning to a depth of 4 to 6 inches. To prevent runoff, water 15 minutes,
wait an hour, water 15 minutes more. Consider letting lawn die but leave the
dead turf as mulch.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  Despite recent soaking rains, there will again be water rationing this summer.
Gardeners will have to stretch their available water to keep all or part of
what's in their yards alive. This guide is intended to help gardeners get the
most out of every drop. The garden shown includes plants, shrubs and trees
likely to be found locally. The watering scheme is based on having 1,400
gallons per week -- an average calculated by the San Jose Water Co. based on
1990 use in this area -- available for irrigation. By using graywater and
cutting down on indoor use by installing low-flow toilets or taking fewer
showers, gardeners can make their water go even further.;

ENHANCING SOIL'S WATER-RETENTIVENESS; Mulching: (Includes diagram of compost
levels); Critical in a drought because it helps prevent evaporation and keeps
the soil cool. Before putting down mulch, cultivate soil and remove weeds.
Established trees and shrubs can be mulched with a 2- to 4-inch layer; smaller
plants, annuals, perennials, bulbs, 2 inches. Leave no bare ground. Use
organic mulches such as hay, compost, peat moss, leaves, redwood soil
conditioner, small bark chips, bark fiber or grass clippings that will
decompose and enrich the soil. If you use compost as a mulch, be sure it is
completely rotted.; ...; Polymers:; Water-absorbing gels that expand to many
times their size, then release excess water slowly into the soil. They seem to
work best when used in containers and raised beds for flowers and vegetables
but can be used with other plantings. Polymers are fairly expensive but can
last many years in the soil. On the flip side, their lasting quality concerns
environmentalists. Some gardeners won't touch polymers because they're
synthetics.; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;
Dispersing graywater: (includes drawing in color); Cut off the top of a
plastic milk carton or coffee can. Punch holes in it and bury in ground by
plant. Fill with graywater. Water will slowly drip into root zone.;
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; SETTING
PRIORITIES; Know your yard. What kind of plants and trees do you have? How
well established are they? How healthy are they? How do they respond to
graywater? What's expendable? There's a world of difference between a
30-year-old redwood or healthly, bearing fruit tree and annuals and ground
cover that can be replaced in one growing season.; ...; Purely personal
choices:; (box) If you take one less shower per week, you will save enough
water for an azalea bush for a week.; (box) If you don't wash your car, you
will save the amount of water a redwood tree needs in a day.; (box) If you use
graywater to flush your toilet, you will save enough after 7 flushes to
irrigate a 100 square feet of raised bed garden for a week; after 14 flushes,
100 square feet of lawn for a week.; ...; How to tell when to water:; (box)
When a plant changes color fropm bright green to dull gray-green and visibly
wilts.; (box) When moisture meter reads in the "dry" range.; (box) If you step
on the lawn and can see your footprint, it needs watering.; ...; How much
water to use(*); (box) Lawn: 100 square feet of lawn needs about 70 gallons of
water per week. (A 20-foot by 20-foot requires 280 gallons per week.) Water
every 5-7 days.; (box) Raised vegetable beds: 100 square feet, mulched, using
drip irrigation, need about 37 gallons of water per week, or about half as
much as the same amount of lawn. May need to be watered twice a week. DO NOT
use graywater on vegetables.; (box) Boxwood hedge: If healthy and established,
a 30-foot hedge containing 5-7 plants needs 30-35 gallons of water per week.
It can probably get by with one 15-to-20-minute watering per month using an
"ooze tube" (porous hose). Graywater OK.; (box) Camellia or rhododendron:
Medium-size bushes need 5-10 gallons per day. Azaleas need about half that
much. Water frequency depends on shallowness of roots; shallower roots need to
be watered more often.; (box) Apricot or orange tree: Need 70-210 gallons per
week. Water monthly. Graywater OK.; (*) Water needs are based on amounts
plants must have to survive in hot, dry conditions.  </TEXT>

MILLIONS OF GALLONS WASTED  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article.
Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The water-loving culprits aren't gremlins. They are automatic water
softening systems. And water officials estimate that they are responsible for
wasting at least a half-million gallons every night in homes throughout the
Santa Clara Valley, enough in one night to supply three average families for a
year.;    There are tens of thousands of automatic water softeners being used
throughout the South Bay: Not the little charcoal faucet attachments, but the
big tanks that sit in garages and laundry rooms. Most are in homes. But many
offices and restaurants also use the devices, which remove calcium, magnesium
and other particles from hard water to make it taste better and to keep it
from leaving ugly deposits in sinks and tubs.;    But that is a luxury that
officials at the Santa Clara Valley Water District say they can no longer
afford.;    "We'll be asking people to turn them off this year," said Teddy
Morse of the Santa Clara Valley Water District. "The water . . . won't taste
the same. But (the softeners) use an awful lot of water.";    Just how much?
Thirty-five to 120 gallons every time the systems need to be flushed. In most
homes, it's every three days. In some homes, restaurants and offices, it's
every night.;    The request to abandon water softeners comes just when water
will be tasting its worst because more of it will be pumped from underground
wells.;    The large amounts of water are used when the softeners "regenerate"
-- using a saltwater solution to clean the resin bead filters that collect the
bad-tasting particles. This cleaning process is automatic, set by a timer for
the wee hours of the morning, when there is little water demand. Then, the tap
typically runs for an hour or more.;    Just how much water runs through
softeners has caught some people by surprise.;    Two months ago, Dave Mendoza
tried to add up how much water he and his wife used each day. They counted the
toilet flushes, the showers, the dishwasher, the two weekly loads of laundry.;
   "It didn't add up. Our water bill said we were using hundreds of gallons
more than we thought," said Mendoza, who lives in San Jose. "Then a neighbor
told us it was our water softener.";    Mendoza discovered the 7-year-old
system used 50 gallons every other day. The Mendozas have since shut it off.; 
  "The water doesn't taste as good," he said, "but we're saving $30 a month on
our water bill.";    Water softener manufacturers are quick to defend their
products.;    "People look at it this way: The family's health is more
important than the fine for using too much water," said Mari Lynn Johnson,
manager of Eco Water Servisoft in San Jose, which rents 6,000 softeners and
sells about 1,200 each year. "It's not as bad as they make it sound.";   
Water officials and consumer advocates reply that, while the softeners may
improve taste, they aren't designed to remove harmful contaminants.;   
"Actually, they send too much salt to the sewage treatment plants," said Pat
Ferraro, a water board member. "The salt will eventually become as important
an issue as how much water they use." An average water softener uses six
pounds of salt each regeneration cycle.;    To keep water-watching customers
from turning away from water softeners, some companies have come up with plans
to clean the resin beads at water plants, so people don't have to use their
home water allotments to flush the purifiers.;    Johnson said her company
installs water flow restricters such as low-flow shower heads to make up for
the water used to clean the systems that it sells.;    "We dread having people
shut everything off because they are wasting water," said Pam Workman of Rayne
Water Conditioning Systems, which has 14,000 customers in the San Jose area.
"There are alternatives.";    In response to the drought, Rayne has developed
a water softener that uses only 12 gallons per regeneration flush. But few
other companies have followed suit.;    The Santa Clara Valley Water District
advises people with water softeners to shut them off for the duration of the
drought. If they can't stomach the water, the district is requesting that
people try to reduce the timing of their softener flushing cycles to once a
week or less.;     How much do they flush?; Here is about how much water
selected automatic softening systems use each time they clean the resin
filters after 1,000 gallons of water have been purified. The frequency of
flushing varies with household water use but is generally every one to three
days.; Type of softener         Minutes water runs    Avg. gallons; ...;

<LEADPARA>  It was an odd scene: Environmentalist Dorothy Green, founding president of
Heal the Bay, was saying Angelenos have "gone overboard" in water
conservation.;   "There's no need to have brown lawns; there's no need not to
flush the toilet when you need to," Green said from her seat on the city's
Department of Water and Power commission. An irate customer had been fuming
over a proposal to raise water rates, after consumers have endured months of
humiliation as they tell out-of-town guests not to flush.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DROP IN WATER USE DRIVES PRICES UP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Like water agencies throughout the state, the DWP is losing money: It is
selling less water to water-saving customers, causing a drop in revenues,
while the cost of providing that water is growing.;   Santa Barbara, which
last year regaled the world with images of residents painting their lawns
green after watering was prohibited, now is dropping most of its conservation
restrictions. The new rules will allow people to buy more water and enable the
city to cover the costs of providing the new water residents have demanded.;  
Projected revenue loss; In Los Angeles, Department of Water and Power
officials say the problem is dire because a mandatory rationing plan called
for 15 percent cuts, but customers instead saved 30 percent. The department
now faces a projected revenue loss of at least $70 million in its $300 million
budget. Meanwhile, the costs of maintaining DWP's system remain the same, and
some costs have increased.;   A toilet retrofit program has been so successful
-- there have been 115,000 orders for the $100-per-water-wasting-toilet rebate
since spring 1990 -- that the program is $8.5 million over its original $2
million budget and probably will end in October.;   The cost of meeting new
water quality standards also has risen.;   If rates don't rise considerably,
water department officials say, projects to expand reclamation and recycling
will be delayed. The agency also would lose its AA bond rating, they say.;  
"If we can't issue debt, we literally shut down," said Mike Gage, DWP
commission president. The agency still would have water, he said, but it would
have to pay tens of millions of dollars in higher interest and it would lose
the water-saving benefits of projects put on hold.;   'Everyone screamed';  
The Santa Clara Valley Water District has faced similar problems. Earlier this
year, the district was in danger of losing its AA bond rating and raised its
water prices by about 50 percent. "When that hit, everyone screamed," said
board member Pat Ferraro.;   Although the financial outlook has improved,
Ferraro said he still worries about the district's ability to finance an
extensive water reuse project he'd like to see.;   And the increase hasn't
been enough to cover some water-saving programs the board wants to start,
Ferraro said. For instance, although the district hired a conservation
manager, it has postponed a toilet rebate program.;   And then there's Santa
Barbara, which at one point imposed 45 percent rationing while officials
scrambled to find more water. That scramble yielded emergency water from the
state and a desalination plant. Along with "March miracle" rains, the new
water sources have convinced city officials they can meet 80 percent of normal
demand for three years even if the drought continues.;   But the new water
sources cost a lot of money, leaving a potential deficit of at least $1
million in the city's water budget.;   People can 'start landscaping';  
Deputy City Administrator Sandra Lizarraga is diplomatic in describing the
motivation for a proposal to roll back rationing: "We're letting people know
they can abandon their hardship practices, and they can start landscaping, but
we're also promoting wise use of water.";   Bob Bronfen, vice chairman of the
city's water commission, is blunt: "Hopefully, people will use more water.";  
Bronfen, who paid $500 for water one month last year, said he approved the new
rules reluctantly, "because I think what we really want in the long run is for
people to use less water. . . . But right now, we have to balance the
budget.";   Los Angeles never faced the kind of Draconian rationing imposed in
Santa Barbara. But with the unexpected 30 percent conservation, the Department
of Water and Power now is seeking an 11 percent rate increase and a hike in a
temporary drought surcharge, from about a penny per 83 gallons to as much as a
penny per 37 gallons.;   'The state's broke too';   "It's inevitable that when
you get substantial conservation savings you lose revenue, and you have to
make it up somehow," said Marc Reisner, author of "Cadillac Desert," a highly
acclaimed book about Western water policy.;   "I don't have an answer. You
can't look to the state. The state's broke too.";   But raising rates after
people conserve twice as much as they are asked to "makes people very
cynical," Reisner said.;   Some city council members here say the DWP should
look to its own budget for cuts to make up the loss, but Commissioner Green
says the department has cut what it can.;   "It's really the horns of a
dilemma," she said. "I don't want to cut that toilet program. But it's chewing
up our budget.";   Said Mary Nichols, the third environmentalist on the
five-member DWP board: "We're not saying, 'Use more water.' We're saying you
don't have to suffer. . . . If people are so afraid of paying a penalty that
they're not flushing toilets when they should, and not washing their hands
when they should, and spreading diseases, that's their problem -- it's not
something we're telling them to do.";   New revenue plan considered; The
problem of plummeting revenues is widespread enough that the state Public
Utilities Commission, which regulates private companies such as the San Jose
Water Co., is studying whether to develop a new revenue plan for companies
howling over their losses.;   The San Jose Water Co. has gotten approval
several times in recent years to raise its rates, according to Sharon Whaley,
a spokeswoman for the company. But the increases covered only increased costs
of buying water, she said. The company was compensated for lost revenue from
decreased sales only once, when the PUC decided last year that the company
could keep conservation penalty money it had collected.;   Even if the drought
ends, water officials say, the state is facing more rate increases to cover
the growing costs of developing new water sources and of meeting tougher
quality standards. In Southern California, the Metropolitan Water District
expects to nearly triple its water prices over the next decade to help cover a
planned $6 billion expansion.;   Excess capacity; "You can see a continued
increase in costs," said MWD general manager Carl Boronkay. "Water was cheap,
still is cheap." Because the Metropolitan Water District's system was built
big to meet needs for several decades, he said, the excess capacity of the
early years fed bad water-use habits. Eventually, conservation was inevitable,
he said, "and the time is here."  </TEXT>

   California Storms Ease Water Shortage,
   But Struggle Against Drought Continues

   Heavy storms pounding California this month have eased
some of its water woes, but they amount to just a drop in the
bucket in the state's continuing struggle to cope with five
years of drought.
   Since the beginning of March, storms roaring down from the
Gulf of Alaska have inundated many parched sectors of the
state. The storms have dumped as much as five inches of rain
and five feet of snow in 24-hour spurts on some parched
areas. More big storms are expected to arrive this weekend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rains are welcome relief from several months of nearly
bone-dry weather, the worst stretch of a drought that has
gripped California since about 1986. The drought threatens to
cost the California economy -- the world's eighth-largest --
billions of dollars this year. In the longer term, dry times
have raised questions about California's water system and its
capacity to keep up with the state's torrid growth.
   The storms have damped the water panic that swept
California in recent weeks, as reservoirs disappeared and
cities all over the state adopted or proposed Draconian
rationing systems. Gibraltar Reservoir, a small lake near
Santa Barbara, has water in it for the first time since it
ran dry over a year ago and may soon begin supplying the
community with water once more. Orange Cove, a dusty little
farm town in the San Joaquin Valley where residents were
facing rationing that would have limited them to 10 gallons
of water per household a day -- enough to flush a toilet 1.5
times -- now will probably get plenty of water this year.
State officials estimate that the storms have added one
million acre feet of runoff to shriveled lakes and rivers. An
acre foot is 326,000 gallons.
   But even with the downpours, rainfall remains at only
about 50% of normal levels for the year. Most of the state's
major reservoirs are still pitifully low. For example, rains
have swollen Shasta Lake, a big federally operated dam and
reservoir system on the Sacramento River, by 300,000 acre
feet since late February. It now holds 1.8 million acre feet.
Its capacity is 4.8 million acre feet. Hetch Hetchy
reservoir, San Francisco's main water source, is currently at
12% of capacity; last year at this time, it stood at 25% of
capacity.
   "The situation has gone from god-awful to pretty
terrible," observes Alan Jones, a spokesman for the state
Department of Water Resources.
   The rains have taken away much of the pressure on
California's new governor, Pete Wilson, to declare a state of
emergency that would have enabled him to transfer water from
farm users to thirsty cities, regardless of water rights.
That is a relief to the governor; such transfers would have
been politically explosive. Farmers use about 80% of
California's water.
   But state water agencies and the federal Bureau of
Reclamation, which control how much water is released from
behind state and federally financed dams in the state, say
they expect to hoard almost all of the storms' runoff to
refill reservoirs that have dropped to record lows. That's
bad news for thirsty cities and farm areas, which had hoped
that the storms might mean more deliveries from the state and
federal systems. Earlier this year, the state cut its planned
deliveries to cities by 90% and eliminated planned
agricultural shipments; the bureau, a big farm supplier, has
cut most of its farm shipments by 75%.
   The rains may mean some scaling back of recently enacted
rationing plans in areas that don't rely heavily on state and
federal water projects, but in most cities, water officials
expect to keep tough conservation measures in place. In San
Francisco, for example, water department officials say the
storms have given them enough water to proceed with a plan to
impose a 45% rationing plan as of April 1; if it hadn't
rained, they might have had to propose even stricter limits.
The San Francisco plan is one of the state's toughest: If
customers exceed their limit twice in a row, the city
installs a device that automatically restricts water flow. If
customers go over the limit three consecutive times, the city
shuts off their water completely.
   Some water officials fear the rains may complicate the
fight against drought. The wet weather may erode the sense of
urgency they hoped would compel people to skimp on showers,
toilet flushing and lawn watering. "A lot of people may ask
themselves why they have to put up with this Draconian water
rationing when their feet are getting soaked as they walk
down the street," said Cheryl Davis, manager of customer
relations at the San Francisco Water Department, adding,
"We're concerned they won't take it as seriously as they
should."

testing to determine long-term performance and reliability. 
</P>
<P>
Until more testing is done, we can't be sure which are the best. If you do see 
a water- or energy-saving device you think might work, consider these buyer 
tips: 
</P>
<P>
First, take your time. Don't be high-pressured into buying because of a 
one-time special price. Reputable sales people will give you time to make up 
your mind. 
</P>
<P>
Then, look at your present costs. Estimate how much of your water and sewer 
bill is due to toilet flushing. Note that toilet flushing uses more water than 
any other tap in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have estimated the cost, find out the pay-back. How long will it take 
you to get your money back after you purchase the product? Will the product 
last that long? Do you plan to be in the same house that long? 
</P>
<P>
Become educated about the water-saving device. Find out about the different 
types of devices available, their cost, and their advantages and drawbacks. 
Free information should be available through libraries. You might also try 
contacting competing firms to see if they carry the same product. Estimates 
from those firms can be very useful. 
</P>
<P>
Look closely at claims. What kinds of tests are the claims based on? Was the 
testing done by an independent, recognized testing laboratory? 
</P>
<P>
Check out the business you are dealing with. It's a good idea to get estimates 
from different companies for the water-saving device you are considering. Price 
should not be the only factor in making the decision. Is this a product you can 
install yourself, or will it require a plumber? 
</P>
<P>
Contact the Better Business Bureau to find out how long the firm has been in 
business. Ask also about its record. 
</P>
<P>
Solar Pool Heater Is Inexpensive, Practical 
</P>
<P>
Q: We spent $200 a month heating our swimming pool last year with natural gas. 
Could we reduce costs by using a solar pool heater? How expensive, how 
complicated, and how practical is it? 
</P>
<P>
A: They can be inexpensive, simple and very practical. Solar pool heaters let 
you dive into spring earlier and stroke deeper into fall. 
</P>
<P>
The season in the sun can stretch from three months to as many as six. Your 
energy savings will pay for the equipment and installation in just a few 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Solar pool heaters need a large area for the solar collectors, on average, 75% 
of the surface area of the pool. A 20x30-foot pool needs 450 square feet of 
south-facing collectors. In many cases, the pump that filters the pool water 
can be used to circulate water through the collectors. 
</P>
<P>
An automatic controller turns the pump on and off as it senses heating supply 
and demand. Some installers are willing to reduce costs slightly if handy 
homeowners donate semi-skilled labor. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, a good pool cover saves money and time by keeping heat in and 
debris out. 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerator Consumes a Lot of Electricity 
</P>
<P>
Q: We went away on vacation for a month and unplugged our electric appliances 
to lower our electric bills. We also switched off the hot water heater. The 
only appliance we left plugged in was the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Our electric bill still seemed high for that month. Can the refrigerator be 
using that much electricity? It's only two years old. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your refrigerator is the third greatest consumer of energy in the home. The 
thermostat setting can make a big difference in how much electricity it uses. 
Thermostats on refrigerators are often inaccurate. Manufacturers put arbitrary 
numbers, like one through six, rather than temperatures on the dial. 
</P>
<P>
To determine what setting to use, you'll need to find out the actual 
temperature inside the refrigerator. Put a thermometer inside the refrigerator 
compartment and look at the reading in an hour or two. Adjust the thermostat 
until you get a setting between 35-38F. 
</P>
<P>
If the freezer compartment has a separate thermostat, set it between 0-5F. 
Stand-alone freezers should be set at 0F. 
</P>
<P>
When you check the temperature inside your refrigerator, take it in several 
places. Varying temperatures may mean you need to defrost the freezer 
compartment or vacuum the dust from the coils on the back or bottom of the 
appliance. 
</P>
<P>
Dust on the coils makes the unit use more energy. If the heat can't be 
dispersed easily, the compressor has to work longer for the same benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some other energy-saving tips: 
</P>
<P>
Locate the refrigerator/freezer away from the stove, dishwasher or direct 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Leave four inches around the condenser coils (usually located in the back of 
the unit) for air to circulate. 
</P>
<P>
Replace leaky or broken door seals. 
</P>
<P>
Use "power saver" or "energy miser" switches unless excessive moisture buildup 
on outside surface occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Reports magazine found a 5F colder setting increased the electrical 
consumption by as much as 30%. Models with the largest freezers had the biggest 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Homeowners Foundation (AHF), disputes often arise 
between homeowners and home-improvement contractors. 
</P>
<P>
They usually concern issues that were not discussed clearly at the time of 
hire. 
</P>
<P>
To help reduce misunderstandings -- and legal problems -- the AHF has developed 
a model contract. It alerts all parties to the areas most often resulting in 
disputes, if not addressed in advance. 
</P>
<P>
You can obtain a copy of the Model Owner-Vendor Contract ($5.95). Send a check 
or money order payable to American Homeowners Foundation to the foundation, at 
1724 S. Quincy St., Arlington, VA 22204. Additional copies are $1.95. 
Professionals can buy a set of 20 contracts for $24.95.

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Jose Luis Villegas -- Mercury News; Some 2,000 tons of old
water-hogging toilets are piled up at the city Recycling Center in Palo Alto,
awaiting crushing for later use as a component of road base. The old toilets
were replaced by new ultra low-flow models that use only 1.6 gallons -- or
less -- per flush through a rebate program sponsored by the city of Palo Alto.
Response was overwhelming to the city's offer of rebates of up to $75 per
toilet to residents and businesses. In all, about 400 toilets in single-family
homes will be replaced through the pilot program, said the city's Monica
Villasenor, and there's already a waiting list of 400 in case more rebates are
offered. Applications still are being accepted to replace toilets in
businesses and multifamily dwellings.  </CAPTION>

<HEAD>Amtrak Pleads Innocent in Sewage-Dumping Charge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amtrak pleaded innocent today to charges
stemming from its practice of flushing passenger-car toilets and
sewage holding tanks into Florida waterways as trains go over
bridges.
   Assistant State Attorney Paul Meredith said the federal railroad
agency submitted its pleas to Circuit Judge Robert Perry by
facsimile machine.
   The plea was entered after Amtrak rejected a settlement offer
from district state Attorney John Tanner, who promised to drop three
charges of commercial dumping if Amtrak would stop all flushing
while its trains cross trestles over creeks and rivers.
   The company said it can't do that because it would set a
precedent. Federal law permits the railway to dump its sewage on its
right-of-way, and this overrides state and local regulations, Amtrak
contends.
   Amtrak has threatened to suspend service in Florida if Tanner
presses his case but Tanner said Amtrak was bluffing.
   Amtrak has come under fire in several Western states as well as
Florida for the sewage dumping.
   But the Putnam County case may be the first to go before a
criminal judge. Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black has said the only
other pending cases are two civil lawsuits in Oregon. There have
been ``concerns and inquiries'' raised in other states, he said.
   ``They run the risk of losing passenger train service,'' said
Black. ``That is something the various jurisdictions must consider.''
   Agreeing to Tanner's plea bargain would make Amtrak a target for
similar demands from anyone else wanting to stop dumping in any body
of water in Florida, Black said.
   ``With the myriad waterways in Florida, it would be an impossible
situation,'' he said.
   Amtrak's 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the
contents of 30-gallon holding tanks when the trains are traveling at
least 35 mph.
   The company hopes eventually to replace much of its fleet with
new cars that would have holding tanks for all toilets. Black said
it would cost $147 million to install those tanks on the current
fleet.

<LEADPARA>  Standing on the pristine beach at Carmel River State Park, I have the eerie
feeling of knowing that a tortured drama is being played out behind a placid
surface reality.;     Two middle-age women with easels and watercolors stare
out over a stunning landscape drenched in a rich, late-afternoon light.
Against a backdrop of soft green hills, the Carmel River meanders through a
golden marsh before entering a lagoon banked by glowing white sand. The sand
is the problem. When rains are normal, the Carmel swells into a river mighty
enough to punch through the sandbar and empty itself into the Pacific. But
when the rains don't come, the river grows weak and expires just a hundred
yards from its destination.  </LEADPARA>

Drought Years 5
One in a series of reports on how the drought is affecting this state.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     On the ocean side of the sandbar, steelhead heavy with eggs and sperm
gather for their historical migration up the Carmel to their freshwater
spawning grounds.;    If the river doesn't open, the steelhead, unlike salmon,
can reabsorb their eggs and sperm and return the following year. But the
Carmel has been closed for the past three years, so the steelhead indigenous
to the river are running out of time. If the stream stays closed another year
or so, says marine biologist Dean Marston, the Carmel River run of steelhead
could be lost entirely.;    The same drama is being played out at the nearby
Salinas and Pajaro rivers, as well as at up to 30 other streams up and down
the California coast.;    While their paintings reflect only the tranquillity
of the scene, the two women on the Carmel beach are well aware of the drought.
Blue Butler said she has had a water-efficient toilet installed and uses wash
water to keep her roses alive.;    Eileen Gardner, who had to apply for an
extra allotment of water when her grandson recently visited, described herself
as a conservationist who saves water not as a response to the current
emergency but "as a way of life.";    (hbox);    SANTA BARBARA -- If fish seem
helpless against the drought, consider the arsenal of weapons available to
Robert Almy, manager of the Santa Barbara County Water Agency.;    His first
line of defense is a sophisticated cloud-seeding program, which, alas, has
been of no use because there are no clouds to seed. So Almy must rely on his
next best weapon: a 3-foot "rain stick" made by Diaguita Indians in northern
Chile. When he turns the hollow stick upside down, pebbles pour over thistles
inserted along its sides, creating the patter of heavy rain.;    "It works as
well as anything," he says with a shrug and a sheepish grin.;    If there were
a capital of the drought, it could be here. Santa Barbara arguably has been
hurt more by the drought than any community so far. Because the county has no
access to state or federal water projects, it has had to rely largely on two
reservoirs. Now one of those is bone dry, and the other has, at best, a
one-year supply of water.;    Through voluntary but pressured conservation,
Santa Barbara has cut water use 45 percent without actual rationing.;    A key
element of the conservation program is a steeply ascending rate structure in
which per-unit water costs increase 800 percent for heavy users. Another
element is a force of "drought cops" who patrol the town in white vans,
dispensing tips on how to save water and issuing $250 citations to those who
squander it.;    The city gives away low-flow shower heads and provides $80
rebates on low-flow toilets, which cost about $110 and use 1.6 gallons of
water per flush rather than the seven gallons used by normal toilets. City
spokeswoman Lisa Weeks said 14,000 toilets already have been replaced.;    On
the drawing boards is a huge desalination plant that would -- at a high cost
-- provide much of the city's water needs. Until that is built, there seems
little the city can do but hope Almy figures out how to use that rain stick.  </TEXT>

   Pittsburgh braced for a long-term water crisis
Monday as a slow-moving fuel spill snaked down the Allegheny River,
threatening supplies to as many as 1 million people.
   ``I think it's very possible the worst of this is yet to come,''
said the city's public safety director, Glenn Cannon. ``There's no
end to it.''
   A hospital served meals on paper plates, supermarkets sold out
of bottled water, schools closed and a steel plant trucked in water
to flush its toilets.
   A landslide late Friday severed an underground 10-inch-wide
pipeline near Freeport, 35 miles north of Pittsburgh. The pipe
spilled between 75,000 and 300,000 gallons of gasoline, diesel fuel
and kerosene into the river.
   Like tumbling dominoes, water companies along the Allegheny were
forced to close the intakes of their water treatment plants one by
one as the 20-mile-long spill oozed toward Pittsburgh, reaching the
city early Monday evening. Some were able to reopen Monday as the
spill became more diluted and the water could be treated with
filters.
   The Pittsburgh Water Department, which serves 450,000 people,
still was drawing water from the river and boosting its reservoirs
Monday afternoon but was preparing to close its intakes at any
moment.
   If the spill ``should move suddenly, we'll have to shut the
plant,'' said Mayor Sophie Masloff.
   Pittsburgh gets only part of its water from the Allegheny, and
had enough reserves to last three to five days, said Cannon. ``The
long-term impact could be devastating,'' he said.
   Up to 20,000 residents served by the Harrison Township Water
Authority have been without water since Saturday and depended on
National Guard portable water tanks set up to provide drinking and
cooking water.
   Orders to conserve water were issued to at least 400,000 other
people served by various other water authorities northeast of
Pittsburgh.
   At least nine school districts closed Monday, idling more than
21,000 students, and many businesses were affected by the spill.
   State emergency officials trucked in water to replenish a
45,000-gallon reservoir at Allegheny Valley Hospital, which draws
its water from the river. The hospital used paper plates and cups
to serve meals to its 225 patients, closed its laundry and was
sending dirty linens to another hospital.
   Drinking water was trucked in for the 2,600 employees of the
Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp. specialty steel plant in nearby
Brackenridge, and some was used to flush toilets, said company
spokesman Bert Delano.
   At Marshall's Amoco station in Natrona Heights about 30 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh, the taps and the car wash went dry Sunday
afternoon, said attendant Laurie Maycock.
   ``Nothing happens when you turn the tap on,'' she said. ``But
it's not so bad. It's raining, so no one wants to wash their car
anyway.''
   Like many supermarkets in the area, the Shop'N Save in Natrona
Heights quickly sold out of 150 cases of bottled water Monday
morning.
   ``That's the thing about water,'' said manager Bill Rossey.
``You don't miss it until it's gone.''
   The thick, gel-like spill, estimated to be 5 to 21 feet deep,
moved almost imperceptibly at times. At its fastest, it moved half
a mile an hour.
   ``It's almost as if it stops and takes a rest somewhere,'' said
John Kaus of the Allegheny County Emergency Management Agency.
   Booms stretched across the river were having little effect, and
recovered less than 10,000 gallons because most of the fuel was
well below the surface, Kaus said.
   About 100 workers from Buckeye Pipeline Co. and two contractors
worked Monday to clean up the leak, said Roy Haase Jr. of Buckeye
Pipeline. Below the source of the leak, crews built a dam on Knapp
Run Creek to collect fuel flowing from the oil-soaked soil.
   The landslide prevented workers from reaching the broken
pipeline, but the danger of an explosion has been minimized by rain
and wind, Haase said.
   Officials said some fish and other aquatic life were killed, but
said it was too early to determine the extent of environmental
damage.

   A group of California's biggest urban water suppliers
agreed to implement conservation measures that will ease, but
by no means quench, the drought-plagued state's huge thirst.
   The suppliers include the agencies that provide water to
about 80% of California's 30 million people, including
inhabitants of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Under the
agreement, the agencies will promote or demand such
water-saving steps as indoor and outdoor water audits,
water-efficient plumbing fixtures such as low-flow shower
heads and low-flush toilets, leak-detection programs and
landscaping water conservation ordinances.

   California is heading into its sixth year of withering
drought. The accord's backers, including Gov. Pete Wilson's
administration, hailed it as an important drought-fighting
measure that will save as much as one million acre feet of
water each year. (An acre foot is 326,000 gallons.)
   However, that savings would be a small drop in a rather
large bucket: California sops up 34 million acre feet of
water each year. Moreover, urban and industrial users consume
only about 15% of California's water; the rest is guzzled by
agriculture. The state and various federal agencies and
officials are grappling with proposals that would reduce
farmers' disproportionate share of water usage, but farmers
are resisting them.
   Barring deluges, agriculture's heavy water usage and the
state's relentless population growth assures that California
will continue to struggle with water shortages, no matter how
much urban water suppliers conserve.

<HEAD>Water Would Be Shipped by Tanker Under Proposal for Dry Coast
Region</HEAD>

   Huge oil tankers steaming along the
Pacific coast from Alaska could be joined next year by ships
carrying water to drought-stricken Southern California, city
officials said Friday.
   Water has become so scarce in Santa Barbara that it's a crime
for a homeowner to hose down his lawn. The gives away low-flow
shower heads and offers $80 each to people who switch from
big-flush to small-flush toilets.
   The water tanker idea is one of three being considered by the
city to ease the drought, said city spokesman Pete Ramsdell.
   The city is negotiating with three companies on a proposal to
import thousands of gallons from Canada. Another idea is to
construct a $50 million desalination plant that would turn sea
water into drinking water, said Ramsdell.
   The city staff will recommend to the City Council on July 31
which idea is worth pursuing further, Ramsdell said.
   Santa Barbara is not connected to either Northern California or
Colorado River supplies and must rely entirely on local sources for
water. Thus it has been the Southern California city hardest hit by
the region's 4-year-old drought.
   City officials made it clear earlier this year they would listen
to just about anyone with an idea on how to get them more water.
   That's where the water tanker idea came in, Ramsdell said.
Proposals rom two Canadian companies and a Santa Barbara firm are
currently being studied.
   Officials of the local company, Sun Belt Water Inc., met with
city officials Friday, said Richard Schuller, the company's
president.
   The company has proposed using tankers to bring in 14,000
acre-feet of water per trip from British Columbia's Toba Inlet.
   Sun Belt's partner in the deal, British Columbia-based water
bottler Snowcap Ltd., is one of several companies already licensed
by the Canadian province to export fresh water.
   Ramsdell said the city, which used about 16,000 acre-feet of
water a year before the drought, wants to import at least 5,000
acre-feet a year of water.
   Schuller, noting his company proposed bringing in far more than
that, said the rest could be sold to other water users in Santa
Barbara County.
   Schuller said his company made an initial bid of $2,700 per
acre-foot. The costs would cover installing terminals in Canada and
California for drawing and unloading the water, he said.
   ``We would own the facilities and operate the ships,'' he said.
