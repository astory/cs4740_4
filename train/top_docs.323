   Actor Robert Duvall has prepared himself for
roles by hanging out with bums on the Bowery, riding horses with
the Texas Rangers and tramping through a Louisiana swamp with an
alligator hunter.
   He's not sure if it was all worth it.
   ``You could do all the research in the world _ sometimes it pays
off, sometimes it doesn't,'' Duvall says in the March issue of
Smart magazine. ``Sometimes you don't have time. You got to be a
human being up there. That's the most important thing.''
   Duvall, who won an Oscar for ``Tender Mercies'' and starred in
``The Godfather'' and ``The Great Santini,'' says he's a stickler
for detail in his characters and in films in general.
   ``When actors start acting bigger than life, bigger than the
people they play, then they're in trouble,'' Duvall said. ``For
example, I can't even talk about `Gone With the Wind.' You don't
see people in the South like that. It's a joke.''

   Two queens, Elizabeth II and Beatrix, are Europe's
wealthiest women, although the English monarch with an estimated
personal fortune of $8.9 billion far outranks her Dutch
counterpart, a magazine said Sunday.
   Britian's Queen Elizabeth is the fourth richest person and the
richest woman in the world, reported Harpers and Queen magazine.
She has a jewelery collection including 25 crowns and tiaras,
racing horses, a valuable art collection and thousands of acres of
land and mineral rights worldwide.
   Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands weighed in at an estimated $4.7
billion.
   Johanna Quandt, who owns 66 percent of the West German
automotive company BMW, is Europe's third richest woman, the
magazine said. It estimated Ms. Quandt's fortune at $3.5 billion.
   Another German, Grete Schickedanz, owner of Quelle, Europe's
largest mail order company, is Europe's fourth wealthiest woman at
$2 billion, the magazine said.
   Athina Roussel, the 5-year-old daughter of the late shipping
heiress Christina Onassis and French pharmaceutical heir Thierry
Roussel, is No. 7 on the list, although Harpers and Queen said she
will not take control of her $840 million fortune until her 18th
birthday, in 2003.
   Forbes' list of the world's richest people published in October
listed Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who made his money in land,
railroads and resorts, as the world's richest individual worth
about $15 billion.
   The Sultan of Brunei and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia have been
reported by Fortune magazine to have more money at their personal
disposal because of the oil riches of their countries. Estimates of
the sultan's wealth have ranged up to $30 billion and Fahd's is
said to be in the $18 billion range.

   Comedian Milton Berle is selling his
longtime home here because it contains too many memories of his
late wife.
   ``I didn't have to sell the house,'' Berle said. ``But there are
too many memories there, you know, after being married 36 years.''
   The 81-year-old comic is negotiating to lease a penthouse on
Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles for $12,000 a month. The house
sold for more than $3 million cash to the owners of a mortgage
company.
   The 60-year-old home went on the block in October following the
death of Berle's wife, Ruth, in April. They had lived in the house
for 19 years.
   Berle had asked $3.65 million, but apparently the property needs
work.
   ``It has a lot of character but needs updating, and that's what
the buyers plan to do,'' said Yaffa Lerner, who sold the house.

   Pulitzer Prize winning author James
Michener has bought a summer home in Brunswick, and plans to move
there late this spring, a real estate broker says.
   ``He wanted to have access to a college library for research and
where it would be cool in the summer,'' said Brunswick broker
Deborah Morton.
   Michener, who has written such books as ``Hawaii,'' ``Alaska,''
``Caribbean'' and ``Space,'' began house hunting last fall and
found a condominium unit, but the deal was not closed until
Thursday, Ms. Morton said. She would not disclose the price.
   The 82-year-old author is known for his historical novels, which
combine history, geography and cultures of different regions. While
researching his books, Michener often moves to the area he is
writing about.

   Journalist Tony Brown told a
predominantly black audience that American blacks are crippled by a
self-imposed ``psychological slavery'' that keeps them from
achieving success.
   Brown said blacks are held captive by a myth: ``If white America
doesn't provide an opportunity for them, they won't have one.''
   ``You are psychologically dependent on someone else,'' Brown
told about 500 people at the annual fund-raising dinner of the
state chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People on Saturday night.
   Brown, host of the black affairs television series ``Tony
Brown's Journal,'' said the civil rights movement has brought
changes in laws that were needed to give blacks an equal footing.
   But it takes more than legislation to reverse a 200-year-old
mind-set of inferiority that plagues many in the black community,
Brown said. He urged blacks to take pride in their African identity
and not wait for others to help them reach their economic and
social goals.
   ``If we want to be equal, let's be equal,'' he said. ``We don't
need anybody to give us freedom.''
   Brown also writes a column that appears in 150 black newspapers,
publishes a quarterly magazine, and produces documentary films.

<LEADPARA>  Queen Elizabeth II, one of the world's richest women, pays no income tax. A
large majority of Britons think that's wrong, by one poll, and legislator
Simon Hughes is trying to do something about it.;    Hughes planned to present
a bill in the House of Commons today proposing that the queen pay income taxes
levied on all of her considerable assets, the exact value of which are kept
secret.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Liberal Democrat's bill apparently stands no chance of becoming law
because both the Conservative government and the leadership of the opposition
Labor Party oppose it. They don't want to upset the monarchy or its
supporters.;    But the bill was expected to test parliamentary opinion on an
issue that has attracted much media attention.;    Conservative legislator
Anthony Beaumont-Dark, Labor legislator Brian Wilson and Hughes called in an
Independent Television program last week for the queen to pay taxes.;    The
rest of the royal family pays taxes.;    An opinion poll published by The
Independent on Sunday some weeks ago said 79 percent of 1,090 Britons
questioned in February thought the queen should be taxed. The newspaper gave
no margin of error.;    Hughes estimates the Treasury could raise $11.2
million a year if the queen's income were taxed. He told the British
Broadcasting Corp. in a radio program Tuesday: "It is completely unfair that
the richest woman in Britain should be exempt.";    Buckingham Palace
officials say the queen's fortune, which includes jewel and art collections,
race horses and real estate, is a private matter. Media estimates of its worth
vary widely.;    The British magazine Harpers and Queen in February named her
as the world's richest woman with assets of $10.5 billion. Fortune magazine
estimated the value of her investments alone at the end of the 1980s at $3.5
billion.;    But the Independent said today it was a myth that she has
billions invested. It said palace officials were content with estimates
valuing her investments at $192 million.;    A survey by the Independent today
said that elsewhere in Europe, the Spanish, Swedish, Belgian and Dutch royal
families all pay tax on their private fortunes. It said only the Norwegian and
Danish monarchies do not pay taxes, but they are among the royal families on
the continent with the fewest holdings.;    The queen's defenders say she
already contributes to the Exchequer through her Crown Estates, which include
farmland and London real estate, officially valued at nearly $3.8 billion last
year.  </TEXT>

   The world has 32 new billionaires this year,
according to a list compiled by Fortune magazine, including indicted
junk-bond chieftan Michael R. Milken and a Taiwanese tycoon with
holdings in insurance, hotels and soy sauce companies.
   Meanwhile, the same five individuals or families who topped last
year's list also lead the 1989 ranking, the magazine reports in its
Sept. 11 edition, due on newsstands today.
   The list swelled to 157 members this year with the addition of 32
members, although five others fell off the ranking. The list
includes individuals and nuclear families with net worth Fortune
estimates at $1 billion or more.
   Taiwanese investor Tsai Wan-Lin, 64, joined the list at the No. 6
spot. The former poor farmer saw his 65 percent stake in Cathay Life
Insurance in Taipei skyrocket in value and his net worth increase to
$9 billion as the Taiwan stock market took off, Fortune said.
   Milken, 43, who faces trial on federal charges that he violated
securities laws, joined the list at No. 125, with an estimated
fortune of $1.2 billion.
   The Sultan of Brunei, who presides over the small oil-rich nation
near the South China Sea, is still the world's wealthiest man with
an estimated fortune of $25 billion, the magazine stated.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and his family are next with $18
billion, followed by Forrest E. Mars Sr. and the Mars candy-bar
clan, who are estimated to be worth $12.5 billion.
   Ranked fourth after the Mars family was the world's richest
woman, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, who is worth an estimated $10.9
billion compared with $8.7 billion last year, Fortune reported.
   Fifth on the list were New York-based publishing magnates Samuel
I. Newhouse Jr. and Donald E. Newhouse, worth an estimated $10
billion.
   Wal-Mart Stores mogul Sam Moore Walton, of Bentonville, Ark., was
seventh with $8.9 billion; the Reichmann brothers _ Albert, Paul and
Ralph _ whose Ontario-based Olympia &amp; York is the largest owner of
New York City commercial real estate, are eighth with $8.4 billion;
British real estate tycoon Gerald Grosvenor is ninth with $6.9
billion; and Kenneth Roy Thomson, who controls Canada's Thomson
Newspapers Ltd., was ranked No. 10 with estimated wealth of $6.9
billion.
   Among other newcomers are Carl C. Icahn, the takeover strategist
who also is chairman and chief stockholder of Trans World Airlines
Inc. and worth an estimated $1.2 billion; Turner Broadcasting System
Chairman Ted Turner, $1.3 billion; Kirk Kerkorian, helped by the
sale this year of MGM-UA Communications Co., $1.1 billion; and
Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon Inc., $3.2 billion.
   Of those on the list, there are 58 in the United States, 54 in
Europe, 23 in Asia, including 11 Japanese, and 22 others.

   If you wondered why oil is worth fighting for,
take a look at Fortune magazine's latest ranking of the world's
billionaires.
   The two richest people on the face of the earth are oil barons,
the magazine reported Tuesday.
   Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, oil-rich leader of the tiny
Pacific sultanate of Brunei, retained Fortune's top title for the
fourth straight year with an estimated worth of $25 billion,
unchanged from 1989.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and clan, a focus of the Persian Gulf
crisis, ranked second with assets worth $18 billion, also unchanged
from last year.
   Fortune spokeswoman Emma Dockendorff said those estimates were
based partly on oil prices in mid-July, when one barrel of crude
fetched about $18.
   Prices have since surged to about $28 a barrel following Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the U.S. move to protect neighboring
Saudi Arabia. That price jump would make the sultan and the king
potentially even wealthier.
   The ranks of Fortune's richest _ bankrolled by assets ranging
from oil to sneakers to ball bearings _ swelled by 25 names this
year to 182 individuals and families, controlling a combined empire
worth $471.3 billion.
   That's up about 7 percent from last year and enough to erase the
U.S. budget deficit, trade deficit and a good chunk of the savings
&amp; loan bailout tab.
   Fortune released the fourth annual ranking in its Sept. 10
issue. It said the average entrant's wealth was only slightly
higher compared with last year after adjusting for inflation.
   But the average fortune was still worth about $2.6 billion,
which if invested in 7.5 percent U.S. Treasury bills would earn
$534,000 a day.
   ``True, you shouldn't feel too sorry for folks who have their
own islands and castles, use Reniors for wallpaper and control, in
the aggregate, $471.3 billion,'' Fortune said.
   As competitor Forbes magazine did in its annual list released
last month, Fortune ditched the Sultan of New York, Donald J.
Trump, whose real estate and casino empire is bogged down in debt.
The magazine had estimated his holdings at $1.7 billion last year.
   Fortune placed Trump in a separate category of fallen tycoons,
who also included troubled takeover strategist James Goldsmith and
convicted financier Michael Milken.
   Ranked third on Fortune's list was the reclusive Mars family of
the United States, whose holdings include Mars Inc. candy bars,
Uncle Ben's Rice and Kal-Kan pet food, worth $12.5 billion.
   Fourth was Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, the wealthiest woman,
with an untaxed personal fortune of $11.7 billion in riches ranging
from 267,000 acres of Royal real estate to racehorses, crown jewels
and a vast stock portfolio.
   Fifth was the Newhouse family of the United States, owners of a
large media empire, worth $11.5 billion; sixth was the Reichmann
family of Canada, with extensive real estate holdings valued at
$11.1 billion; tied for seventh were Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, Japan's
richest industrialist, and Arkansas retailing mogul Sam Walton,
both valued at $7.3 billion; eighth was John W. Kluge of the United
States, owner of media giant Metromedia Inc., valued at $7.0
billion; ninth was Tsai Wan-lin and family of Taiwan, owners of a
construction and insurance empire worth $6.5 billion; 10th was the
Thomson family, owners of Canada's biggest newspaper chain, at $6.2
billion.
   American newcomers included the Stephens family of Arkansas,
owners of investment banking, energy and real estate holdings worth
$1.7 billion; the Parfet family of Kalamazoo, Mich., owners of a
large stake in the Upjohn Co. drugmaker, worth $1.5 billion; and
Philip Knight, head of the Nike Inc. athletic footwear maker, $1.3
billion.
   Foreign newcomers included Alicia and Esther Koplovitz of Spain,
owners of a $2.2 billion construction and banking fortune; Hiroshi
Termachi, owner of a $1.8 billion Japanese ball bearing business;
and John Spyros Latsis, European head of a Saudi Arabian shipping
and oil-refinery network worth $1.8 billion.
   The magazine based estimates of net worth on what it called
``published information or appraisals of asset values.'' To
qualify, each prospect needed a net worth of $1 billion or more
after subtracting debt.
   Fortune said the United States remained home to the greatest
number of billionaires at 58. Twenty were from the Persian Gulf, 15
from West Germany, nine from Italy, and eight in Japan, down from
12 last year.

$10.7 billion. New York cosmetics queen Estee Lauder and
family are second, with $5.2 billion.

<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II, whose personal fortune is a
closely guarded secret, is Britain's richest person worth an
estimated $5.87 billion, according to a list of the nation's 200
richest people.
   The list was front-page news in London on Thursday, with racy
tabloid headlines ranging from ``Filthy Rich'' in the Sun to
``Millionaires Galore'' in the Daily Mail.
   Money Magazine, which complied the list, said the
second-wealthiest Briton as 92-year-old Sir John Moores, founder of
the Littlewoods soccer pools empire, a weekly game for small-time
gamblers based on soccer results. It estimated his fortune at $2.99
billion.
   It listed the third-wealthiest Briton as supermarket chain owner
Garfield Weston, 60, chairman of Associated British Foods, with an
estimated personal fortune at $2.64 billion.
   In fourth place is the 36-year-old Duke of Westminster. His
inherited holdings include large chunks of highly desireable real
estate in central London, huge tracts of farmland and sweeping
acres of remote northern moorland. The magazine said his personal
fortune was about $2.46 billion.
   Money Magazine says Britain has seven billionaires, 18 families
and individuals worth more than $440 million each, and 20,000
millionaires as measured in pounds.
   The magazine's estimate of the 61-year-old queen's wealth makes
her the world's eighth-richest individual. It said the world's
richest person is the Sultan of Brunei, with an estimated fortune
equivalent to $24.64 billion.
   The Guinness Book of Records lists the richest person in the
United States as Sam Moore Walton, founder of Wal-Mart discount
stores in Bentonville, Ark., whose personal wealth was estimated in
mid-1987 at $4.5 billion ``and rising.''
   Money Magazine said financier Sir James Goldsmith _ fifth in its
list of Britain's wealthiest 200 with an estimated $1.76 billion _
was the only British billionaire to have made all his money since
the end of World War II in 1945.
   The youngest person in the top 200 is 31-year-old Sophie Mirman,
with an estimated $52.8 million. She and her husband, Richard Ross,
created the popular Sock Shop chain.
   Among the 12 women in the top 200 list are ``Dynasty'' star Joan
Collins and her sister, Jackie Collins, the author of a string of
best-selling raunchy novels. It said they are worth an estimated
$26.4 million between them.
   Editor Sue Thomas said it took six months to compile the list,
``consulting public sources of information and talking extensively
to analysts in the City,'' London's financial district.
   ``The people we did not talk to were the 200 themselves because
we wanted to keep the list under wraps until the last possible
minute. Many of the super-rich are very secretive,'' she said.
   Asked how it estimated the queen's wealth in view of the secrecy
maintained by her London bankers, Coutts and Co., Mrs. Thomas said:
``We found out as much as we could about the different headings
under which her wealth falls _ her castles and other properties,
her land holdings, her vast share portfolio, her stamp collection,
her art collection, her jewelry collection and so forth and we
talked to a lot of people with information.
   ``We arrived at what we estimate to be a minimum net worth for
all the people on our list.''
   It said 53 of the 200 fortunes stemmed from property. Five
percent of those listed came from abroad and only 15 percent belong
to the British aristocracy. The self-made rich outnumbered those
who inherited their wealth by 2-1.

'ROYAL WATCHER' KEEPS TABS ON ALL THE WINDSOR RICHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Queen of England is worth well over 2,000 times her weight in gold. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly. 
</P>
<P>
In mere money, the 126-pound monarch, almost certainly the world's richest 
woman at any weight, possesses somewhere between $1.72 billion and $2.04 
billion. And -- here's the good part -- it's all tax free. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a good chunk of the royal private fortune derives from gifts, some 
dating back to the days of Queen Victoria, of jewels, land and hefty sums of 
cash from maharajahs, sheiks, sultans and subjects who show no signs of turning 
off the tap to the sovereign -- or her family. 
</P>
<P>
These estimates are made by Andrew Morton, professional "royal watcher," who 
traced the British royal family's private holdings -- in precious gems, 
estates, art, investments, race horses, automobiles, even a stamp collection -- 
to come up with what he claims is the best guess yet of how rich the royal 
family really is. 
</P>
<P>
Of course estimates of the royal riches are cranked out regularly, in what 
amounts to a mini-industry. Last September, Fortune magazine put the queen's 
worth at $10.9 billion. Other estimates have varied wildly over the years from 
a few paltry millions to as much as $26 billion, all of which Morton maintains 
are skewed by questionable motive or bad information. 
</P>
<P>
"There is this huge wall of secrecy surrounding anything to do with the royal 
family," Morton said in an interview in Los Angeles. "Everybody thinks they 
know everything about the Windsors. They know nothing. The often used image is 
that the Windsors live in a goldfish bowl. If it's a goldfish bowl, it's one 
that's been blacked out." 
</P>
<P>
Morton has laid out his stalking of the royal finances in a new book published 
simultaneously here and in Great Britain, where it was excerpted in a national 
newspaper and is due to be serialized in other publications. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs Is the Kingdom: The Wealth of the British Royal Family" is studded with 
the usual royal tidbits: a Canadian air force jet being dispatched to return 
Prince Charles' "beloved" crocodile shoehorn left behind on a visit to 
Winnipeg, the queen diverting her yacht so that she could mail a letter, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
But the core of the book is a cold-eyed banker's assessment of the origins and 
disposition of the private wealth that supports the House of Windsor. One 
chapter traces the development of the family's finances from Queen Victoria to 
the present, including deductions based on the limited evidence available about 
the current queen's stock portfolio, apparently brimming with mining and 
electronic issues and estimated to be worth $595 million to $680 million by 
Morton. 
</P>
<P>
"I hired somebody for two months who was a proper stocks and shares expert to 
look into this thing because their (the royal family's) stocks and shares are 
disguised by something called the Bank of England nominee accounts, which were 
set up by the government in order specifically to shield the queen's 
investments from investigation," Morton explained. 
</P>
<P>
The book's appendix includes an inventory of "known" royal jewels, estimates of 
land values and income from estates and other holdings, including a shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The inventory of Queen Elizabeth's private jewelry -- as opposed to the crown 
jewels and other property held in public trust -- includes a tiara last seen in 
public in 1911 with an estimated value of $600,000 and a 94.4-carat diamond 
valued at $9.5 million. The assessment made for Morton puts the total value of 
the diamonds, emeralds, rubies, pearls and sapphires at $60.6 million to $71 
million. It is a conservative estimate and does not include the market value -- 
up to 10 times or more of assessed worth -- that would be added because of 
their royal ownership, according to Morton. 
</P>
<P>
During his investigation, Morton said he bumped into a lot of obstacles -- laws 
that shroud royal investments in secrecy, uncooperative sources close to the 
royal family and the family's own fierce protection of its privacy. For 
example, since the time of Queen Victoria, royal financial advisers have taken 
"the secrets that they have to the grave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morton is the author of seven books about the royal family, a former newspaper 
correspondent who covered the royal beat and now proprietor of Palace Press, an 
independent news agency specializing in news and features about the royal 
family. But even for him, Morton admitted, much of royal life is unknown 
territory. Not only that, but the royals are protected by a "global myth 
machine" that further obscures the difference between royal image and reality, 
Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
"The royal family, like the best actors, put on a very good display for the 
public but in private they are very different people," he continued. "They're 
not everything that the public thinks. For example, the royal family today 
lives very much the way Queen Victoria did. Prince Charles, this man who is 
described as 'everyman, the crusading prince,' still goes grouse shooting with 
kings, dines with billionaires and millionaires in exactly the same way that 
Edward VII did a hundred years ago." 
</P>
<P>
One instance of royal obfuscation occurred in 1986 when a sapphire and diamond 
ensemble was omitted from the list of official gifts made to the Prince and 
Princess of Wales by the Sultan of Oman, Morton said. The ensemble, estimated 
to be worth $1.7 million and designated as a private gift, was only admitted to 
exist a year later when the Princess happened to wear them in public, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Morton theorized that this royal reluctance "rightly shows the embarrassment 
they feel" about receiving such lavish gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Like the monarchy itself, the giving of gifts to the royal family is an 
enduring anachronism, Morton said. "I find the psychological and sociological 
aspects of it just fascinating," he said. "Why give to the richest woman in the 
world? . . . In a sense it shows that we're not really that far off from 
primitive tribes, that we live in a global village and that we still look to 
the equivalent of the squire on the hill." 
</P>
<P>
Morton contends, however, that the royal family will not always be able to 
protect its private wealth and enjoy unique privileges. 
</P>
<P>
In his book he notes, "The Windsors have shrewdly used the shield of their 
public duties to construct an armor of legal concessions, ranging from their 
wills to their shares, to deflect the arrows of outrageous inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a question of fine judgment for the royal family -- and ultimately 
Parliament -- about how long their legal and tax advantages, secured by dint of 
their public role, can coexist alongside their increasingly vocal demands to be 
left a lone and treated as ordinary people. Ironically the very success of the 
Windsor dynasty may prove to be its undoing."

<HEAD>Magazine Says Mars Candy Bar Family Richest in America</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mars candy-bar clan is worth $12.5 billion,
surpassing the Newhouse publishing dynasty as the richest family in
America, Fortune magazine reports.
   If Fortune's estimate is correct, the worth of the Marses could
buy about 25 billion regular-size Snickers bars, which if laid end
to end would circle the planet Mars nearly 32 times.
   The magazine's calculation is more than any previous estimate of
the wealth of the secretive family, which shuns publicity about
itself and its candy bar company, maker of Snickers and M&amp;Ms.
   ``Mars's assets are often underestimated because the company is
as loose with information as its McLean, Va., neighbor, the CIA,''
Fortune said Wednesday in an advance press release about its 1988
Billionaires List, to be carried in the Sept. 12 issue available on
newsstands next Monday.
   The magazine said it based the estimate of the Marses' wealth on
what comparable food concerns have sold for recently.
   ``Thus, Forrest Mars and his three children, Forrest Jr., John
and Jacqueline, overtake the Newhouse publishing magnates as the
richest Americans,'' Fortune said.
   Still, the Marses rank No. 3 on Fortune's worldwide list. The
richest remains the Sultan of Brunei, whose oil wealth makes him
worth $25 billion. Next is King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and family,
worth $18 billion.
   Fourth is Britain's Queen Elizabeth II with $8.7 billion; next
is the Newhouses, whose communications holdings are worth $8
billion; in sixth place is retail king Sam Walton, founder of
Wal-Mart stores, and family, worth $7.4 billion; seventh is
Canada's Reichmann family, with $6.3 billion in assets that range
from swank New York real estate to interests in railroads and
utilities.
   Eighth is Kenneth Irving and family, a Canadian clan that owns
400 companies worth $6.2 billion; ninth is Kenneth Thomson and
family, Canadian owners of a publishing, retailing, energy and real
estate empire worth $6 billion; and in 10th place is Gerald
Grosvenor and family, British land barons worth $5.4 billion.
   Of the 129 individuals and nuclear families that comprise this
year's list, there are 51 in the United States, 38 in Europe, 19 in
Asia _ including 12 Japanese _ 13 Arabs and eight others, Fortune
said.

<LEADPARA>  Is she or isn't she the world's richest woman? And should she or shouldn't she
pay taxes on her income, just like everyone else? Those brash questions about
Queen Elizabeth II were raised in Parliament this week by Liberal Party Member
of Parliament Simon Hughes, in a move that reflected the opinion of a majority
of citizens.;    More than 70 percent of the British, polls show, believe her
income should be subject to taxes. Or as Hughes put it, "When so many people
in my (London) constituency are scraping along and asked to contribute tax on
very low incomes, it seems grossly unfair that the person with the highest
income escapes. And there's no reason a modern constitutional monarch
shouldn't pay taxes."  </LEADPARA>

ESTIMATES PLACE MONARCH'S WEALTH AT $7.4

<TEXT>     The queen's personal net worth has long been a matter of considerable
speculation and argument, since, unlike U.S. heads of state, she is not
required to make public the amount of her wealth and she has not volunteered
the information. Estimates range on the high side -- Fortune magazine
estimates it at $7.4 billion, with an annual income of perhaps $3 million a
day; Buckingham Palace snorts that such a sum is "grossly exaggerated." There
also is a more modest estimate that her income is $35 million annually.;   
Over the years, researchers have tried to estimate the queen's personal
capital and income. Those assets are different from the institutions of the
monarchy, including the crown jewels in the Tower of London and the official
residences of Buckingham Castle, Windsor Castle, and Holyrood Castle.;    As
far as current official income goes, she receives from the British government
-- in what is called the Civil List -- 7.9 million pounds, or about $12.5
million. That sum is much more than her royal household expenses, giving her a
comfortable surplus this year. (Her employees, incidentally, pay taxes on
their salaries.);    But the queen has other major resources: Whatever money
she inherited from her father, King George VI; a vault full of precious jewels
-- crowns, tiaras, diamonds, rubies, emeralds; Faberge eggs; and the royal art
collection with 900 Leonardo Da Vinci drawings, 26 Van Dycks and works by
other masters. There is also one of the world's most valuable stamp
collections.;    Further, she owns hundreds of thousands of prime agricultural
acres, as well as valuable property in central London. Then there are Balmoral
and Sandringham castles with 64,000 acres between them. Not to be forgotten
are the royal stud farms and stables.;    The queen's major source of income
may be her private investments, which have accrued tax-free over a long
period. In 1971, to quiet speculation, the palace let it be known that her
investment portfolio in stock shares did not exceed 50 million pounds.;   
Taking an even lower figure of 35 million pounds, Andrew Morton, author of
"Theirs Is the Kingdom: The Wealth of the Windsors," consulted experts who
estimated that, if reasonably wisely invested, the portfolio would be worth
600 million pounds today. He estimates the queen's personal wealth at 1.2
billion pounds.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II, believed to be the world's
richest woman, grumbles about the price she has to pay for her
clothes and is happier wearing a pair of comfortable old shoes,
according to her favorite couturier.
   Sir Hardy Amies says in the May 23 issue of the Woman's Own
weekly that the queen is not a ``clothes person.''
   The designer, who will be 81 in July, is Dressmaker by
Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen, a title granted by Buckingham
Palace.
   ``She grumbles about our prices, drops hints and things, but she
has been told ... that those are the prices,'' Amies said.
   He said the queen often ignores his advice.
   ``She doesn't care, basically. She listens to our advice, then
goes off and wears shabby shoes because they're comfortable.
   ``In my opinion that is perfectly all right. It's only the hoi
polloi who criticize,'' he said.
   Princess Anne, the queen's daughter, ``won't pay our prices and
she's happy with the way she dresses,'' said Amies.

the blushing, virginal, newlywed-to-be in the Charles Shyer-Nancy Myers remake
of the MGM classic, "Father of the Bride." (This team did "Baby Boom" and
"Private Benjamin.") Then Mother Nature stepped in. Cates became pregnant, but
her agents thought she could play the part before this became evident. The
producers didn't agree. So Cates is now out of the movie and her replacement
is still being sought.;    From what I hear, blushing, virginal young things
are hard to find in Hollywood. Reps for the film have even gone to England to
look, with no success. It seems most young actresses these days dress and look
so sophisticated, so polished, so "tough" if you will, that even the truly
virginal among them seem to have been "through the mill.";    According to
Sandollar producer Howard Rosenman, this remake will be a straight update of
the 1950 original. Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are to play the Spencer
Tracy-Joan Bennett roles. Martin Short will be the supercilious "wedding
coordinator." And whatever sweet young thing takes over from Cates will have
the burdensome knowledge that she is doing a role Elizabeth Taylor made
famous.;    Actually, in 1950, Taylor was a virginal young thing.  </TEXT>

   A Japanese developer again topped a list of the
world's richest people, but the annual tally has one conspicuous
deletion this year: Donald J. Trump.
   Despite the financial troubles of the New York developer, the
United States continues to contain the world's largest number of
billionaires _ 62 _ according to estimates by Forbes magazine. In
addition, there are 37 U.S. families with fortunes over $1 billion,
Forbes says in its July 23 issue.
   Forbes, in estimates released Monday, says the world's
wealthiest person for the fourth straight year was Yoshiaki
Tsutsumi of Japan, whose railroad and real estate empire includes
golf courses, ski resorts and hotels. Forbes estimated his net
worth at $16 billion, up about $1 billion from last year.
   That estimate was far greater than that of rival business
magazine Fortune, which put Tsutsumi's net worth at $3.1 billion
last September.
   Fortune said the world's richest person is the Sultan of Brunei,
at $25 billion. Forbes excludes heads of state from consideration.
   Following the 56-year-old Tsutsumi on the Forbes list was
Japanese developer Taikichiro Mori, a former economics professor
who now owns 78 office buildings. Forbes put Mori's net worth at
$14.6 billion.
   Ranked third was the family of Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart,
the third-largest U.S.retail chain. Forbes estimates that the
Waltons, who also were third-ranked last year, are worth $13.3
billion, up from $8.7 billion in 1989.
   America's du Pont family was fourth, with a net worth estimated
at $10 billion. They were followed by Hans and Gad Rausing, two
Swedish brothers who control a packaging empire worth $9.6 billion.
   Kitaro Watanabe, a Japanese real estate owner, was sixth at $9.2
billion. He was followed by Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of
the Olympia &amp; York real estate company, at $9 billion.
   Kenkichi Nakajima and his family, founder of Japan's largest
maker of pachinko machines, a gambling game similar to pinball,
were eighth at $8.4 billion.
   South Korea's Shin Kyuk-ho, who owns a candy and real estate
empire, was ninth at $7 billion to $8 billion; and Forrest E. Mars
and family of the United States, of Mars candy fame, were 10th at
an estimated $6 billion.
   Other American families with net worth exceeding $3 billion
included the Newhouse, Hearst and Cox families, which derive their
fortunes from publishing and broadcasting; the Bass family of
Texas; the Mellon family of banking fame; the Dorrance family,
whose wealth comes from Campbell Soup Co.; and Bill Gates, founder
of the computer software company Microsoft Corp.
   John Werner Kluge remained the richest American individual,
according to Forbes. Kluge, founder of the media company
Metromedia, has an estimated net worth of $5.2 billion, placing him
in a tie for 12th place on the worldwide list with the Newhouses.
   As for Trump, Forbes put his net worth last year at $1.7
billion, but it dropped sharply this year as the value of his real
estate and airline empire plummeted. In April, the magazine said he
was worth about a half a billion dollars. Some sources peg it even
lower.
   Forbes says one trend it noticed in compiling this year's list
was the number of wealthy Germans. The magazine identified 38 West
German billionaire families _ far more per capita than in Japan or
the United States.
   The list includes 40 Japanese and 99 American individuals or
families with a net worth over $1 billion.
   Forbes says it identified 271 billionaire individuals or
families worldwide, up from 226 last year. The compilation is based
on recent stock valuations, comparable real estate valuations and
currency exchange rates, among other factors.
   The magazine says it excludes from consideration royal families
and heads of state because their wealth ``derives more from
political heritage than from economic effort.''
   But it doesn't exclude drug dealers. Among the billionaires it
lists are Colombia's Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the head of the
Medellin cocaine cartel, at about $3 billion, and Colombia's Ochoa
family, at about $2 billion.

Born in Peru to Italian parents and educated in the United States, Gabriella De 
Ferrari has written her first novel in her third language. Though trained as a 
diplomat, she became director of Boston's Museum of Contemporary Art, then 
curator of the renowned Fogg Museum. All three national cultures and both 
professional disciplines figure significantly in "A Cloud on Sand," which 
begins in a small Italian coastal village, moves on to a provincial South 
American city with a sizeable Italian population, and is suffused throughout 
with an artistic sensibility to landscape, color and form. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the book is written in the English taught to an adult instead of 
the language naturally acquired by a child lends the prose a formal and 
somewhat dated quality perfectly suited to a story set abroad in the period 
from 1920 to the end of World War II. There's a lushness here, a sense of 
hyper-reality and an expansiveness of character that contrasts strongly with 
our contemporary home-grown pragmatism. The frame of reference is never taken 
for granted, but generously supplied by a variety of sensory images, so that 
the reader not only visualizes the exotic settings, but perceives the 
particular sounds, tastes and textures. At first the structure seems somewhat 
arbitrary and obscure. A woman named Marta, unidentified until the end of the 
novel, is asking questions of Antonia, eliciting the detailed answers that 
become the novel proper. After a brief prologue that takes place on a ship 
leaving Buenos Aires for the fictional town of Pica, in the country of Yayaku 
adjoining Chile, we're transported back to Antonia's girlhood in a small 
fishing village on the Italian Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
The time is the 1930s, and Artemisia is generally by-passed by foreign 
travelers eager to get from Genoa to Florence. Artemisia has few attractions, 
though it does boast a grand white stone villa set squarely in the midst of the 
crumbling medieval streets. This is Antonia's home, built as her father's 
capitulation to the wishes of her mother, Dora. After their wedding, Antonia's 
father had taken his capricious peasant bride to Argentina, where he was one of 
the newly prosperous Italian settlers. After one look at Buenos Aires, Dora 
refused to disembark, returning to Italy on the boat that brought her. Bowing 
to her indomitable will, her husband built the grand villa in Artemisia, 
visiting his family twice a year. In his long absences, Dora conducted herself 
as a single woman, taking a succession of casual lovers but soon settling upon 
the gentle and devoted Count Mora. He would be her protector for the rest of 
her days, acting in loco parentis for Antonia and her brother Marco, mitigating 
Dora's often baleful influence upon the children. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Antonia falls in love and marries an Italian businessman living in 
Yayaku. Her character strengthened by the count's lofty ethical principles, 
Antonia remains in the remote outpost in which she finds herself, though she is 
still enough her mother's daughter to insist on living according to her own 
instincts and desires, not caring if she outrages Pica's tightly-knit and 
conservative Italian community. She becomes a strong and capable woman, a wife 
perhaps more adored than adoring, but essentially content with her 
extraordinary existence. 
</P>
<P>
De Ferrari gives us a spacious gallery of domestic interiors and landscape 
studies, re-creating the curious atmosphere of a European colony two continents 
away from its source; trapped in a time warp even more alienating than mere 
geographical distance. Against these rich, dense backgrounds, her characters 
grow in strength and vitality, welcoming us into a mysterious, vanished world.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- The Gallery:
   MoMA Gets Former CBS CEO's Art Trove
   ----
   By Jack Flam

<LP>
   New York -- The late William S. Paley, founder and
longtime chairman of CBS, was widely considered to be about
as tough as they come. But he was also an enthusiastic
collector of modern paintings and an avid supporter of the
Museum of Modern Art -- and in those areas of his life he
seems to have given rein to his gentler and more generous
impulses. "The William S. Paley Collection," in which the
more than 80 works that he recently bequeathed to MoMA are
being shown together publicly for the first time, provides a
double reason for celebration.
   The first reason is that this extraordinary collection
contains a number of important and beautiful works that will
complement and fill out the museum's own permanent collection
in significant ways. The second is that Mr. Paley had the
generosity, good sense and good taste to allow the museum to
display his collection as it sees fit. Unlike a number of
other major collectors, who insist that their collections be
exhibited intact regardless of the best interests of the
institutions that receive them, and who even bargain with
museums on that basis, Mr. Paley made his bequest with no
strings attached. This kind of generosity reaffirms the
viability of MoMA's admirable policy of not dividing its
permanent collections into little monuments to big egos, by
refusing to accept collections that come with the proviso
that they must be displayed separately forever and for all
time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But then again, Mr. Paley was a very particular kind of
collector who had a very special relationship to MoMA. He
became a trustee of the museum in 1937, when it was only
eight years old, and he served on its board for many years
before he went on to become president in 1968, and eventually
chairman, during the museum's crucial years of expansion
between 1972 and 1985. When he died in 1990, he was chairman
emeritus.
   Moreover, although he put together an exceptional
collection, Mr. Paley was not a collector in the usual sense.
He began to buy modern pictures in 1935, at a time when doing
so was not particularly fashionable, and he bought them by
following his own tastes and enthusiasms rather than by
pursuing some ideal "wellrounded" or "comprehensive"
collection. He once stated his rule of thumb for collecting
as "Don't buy it unless you can't live without it." And
indeed, most of the pictures in his collection seem to
reflect the more passionate preoccupations of the man who
acquired them. They tend to be richly painted and rather
intimate in scale and feeling-contemplative rather than
dramatic, and sensuous rather than showy. In the fullest
sense, his collection was part of his private, rather than
his public life. He shunned publicity related to it, was
reluctant to lend works from it, and got most of his ego
gratification in places other than the art world.
   William Rubin, director emeritus of MoMA's Department of
Painting and Sculpture, has installed the Paley collection
with great sensitivity to its particular strengths. The works
are thoughtfully arranged in a setting that is at once
spacious but intimate, and that is as attentive to the rich
physical presence of the pictures as to the ideas and
historical lessons implicit in them. As a result, little gems
like Renoir's delightful "Strawberries" or Manet's tiny but
electric rendering of "Two Roses on a Tablecloth" come across
as vividly as the larger and historically more important
pictures, such as Derain's brilliantly colored "Bridge Over
the Riou" of 1906, which is a significant addition to the
museum's fauve collection.
   The tone of the exhibition is nicely set by the first work
you see, Gauguin's beautifully painted "The Seed of the
Areoi." In it, a nude Tahitian woman holds in her hand a
flowering seed, a potent symbol of her own sensuality and
procreative force, which is further reinforced by the
resonant colors and rich visual textures of the picture as a
whole. As in many other paintings in the show, the
wonderfully fresh surface offers a further delight to the
eye. Similarly, the haunting poetry of Picasso's famous "Boy
Leading a Horse" of 1905-06 is wonderfully intensified by its
matte surface, which emphasizes the picture's seductive
combination of austere idealization and insistent
physicality. In Picasso's lessknown but almost equally
impressive "Nude With Joined Hands" of 1906, the fresh,
shimmering pinks of the background envelop the woman's body
in an incandescent glow.
   Both Picasso and Matisse considered Cezanne to be a god of
painting, and the master of Aix might well be considered
MoMA's household deity. It is thus especially gratifying to
see the museum finally acquire a self-portrait by Cezanne,
bearded and sporting a rather jaunty straw hat. The museum's
already fine Cezanne collection will also be markedly
enhanced by the addition of a grand and richly painted
L'Estaque landscape and of a powerfully composed and
vigorously painted still life.
   Although MoMA has one of the best Matisse collections in
the world, it has been surprisingly weak in works from the
socalled Nice Period, from 1918 to 1930. The Paley collection
includes four Matisses from this period. A small 1918
landscape, which has the freshness of a colored drawing, and
a charming little 1923 "Woman With Anemones" are fairly
typical of Matisse's somewhat low-key work during this
period. But the two others are among the most impressive
pictures Matisse did during the 1920s. The vibrant "Odalisque
With a Tambourine" of 1926 is painted with an extraordinary
combination of virtuosity and abandon, while the enigmatic
"Woman With a Veil" of 1927 combines the ambition and
pictorial complexity of Matisse's earlier, more abstract
works with the directness and sensuality that he cultivated
at Nice.
   From such heights, Mr. Paley's collecting trailed off
after World War II, and his holdings in more recent American
art are distinctly less significant than those in earlier
French art. Nonetheless, there are some pleasant surprises.
Chief among these is the unexpectedly painterly "Homage to
the Square in Green Frame" by Joseph Albers, which is one of
that rather chilly artist's least impersonal works. Even in
the cool world of geometrical abstraction, Mr. Paley was able
to find at least a tremor of sensuality.
   "The William S. Paley Collection" is accompanied by a
thorough and informative catalog written by William Rubin and
Matthew Armstrong. The exhibition will be on view at MoMA
through April 7. After that, it will travel to Indianapolis,
Seattle, Los Angeles, San Diego, Baltimore and New Orleans
before it returns to New York to be integrated into the
museum's permanent collections in the spring of 1994.

FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Brazil - the beautiful and the damned /
Christina Lamb describes trillionaire life in the country with the biggest
gap between rich and poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL is perhaps the only country in the world where the entire working
populace are millionaires. Unfortunately, most are also poor. With a million
cruzeiros now worth Dollars 25, to be seriously rich in Brazil one must have
a good few trillion stashed away.
And plenty such people exist. Forget the Brazil of economic crises, growing
slums, ailing Indians and Dollars 2,000 per capita income. Instead, welcome
to the country which is second only to the US in purchase of private jets
and where high society is so flourishing that the Association of Columnists
boasts more than 500 working members and even the Journal of Commerce has a
large gossip column.
Wealth is flaunted. At one favourite hangout, Leopoldos, in Sao Paulo,
diners watch images of themselves and other customers projected on to a
giant videoscreen, enabling close scrutiny of who is wearing what and
flirting with whom. In tropical Rio, fur wraps are de rigueur for true
socialites.
These are the authentic beautiful and the damned. 'Beautiful' because in the
world capital of plastic surgery, nobody with money is allowed to retain
nature's imperfections. Nose jobs, face lifts, bottom tucks, cellulite
removal, breast implants - the decision is not if but when the next cut
should come. Ivo Pitanguy is Brazil's high priest of plastic surgery;
fittingly, he has become a member of the serious rich himself, owning an
island south of Rio.
'Damned' because Brazil has the world's biggest income gap between rich and
poor - a contrast particularly obvious in Rio, where luxury apartments rub
shoulders with sprawling slums. Already the crime rate is so high that even
the only-slightly-rich live behind bars protected by armies of security
guards and drive bullet-proof cars. Sometimes, sipping cocktails on their
penthouse terraces, rich Brazilians look at the lights of the surrounding
slums and wonder how long before the masses swarm upon them, demanding
justice.
Meantime, they are having a ball. 'The Brazilian elite are like a bunch of
people having a wild champagne party on a boat which is heading towards the
edge of Niagara Falls,' says a World Bank official.
The day starts late for Brazil's seriously rich. For the women it begins
with exercises or a jog along the beach, followed by a light lunch at a
restaurant such as Antiquarius to discuss the events of the previous night.
Then it is a trip to the hair salon, perhaps tea at the Copacabana Palace,
then home to prepare for a party or dinner at one of Rio's classy French
restaurants - Le Bec Fin, Claude Troisgros or Le Meridien. For the younger
set, preferred hangouts are Banana cafe or Gattopardos, followed by dancing
at Hippopotamus.
Weekends are spent messing about on boats, jetskis and microlites in the
coastal resorts of Angra dos Reis or Buzios, or horse-riding in the
mountains of Petropolis. There are also frequent trips to the requisite
fazenda in the country, and to Miami, New York and Paris where rich
Brazilians descend on fashion houses like Chanel and Balenciaga, practising
the French that it is so chic to speak at home.
Although Brazil's security problems have caused a few of the rich to flee
permanently, most return. According to Jeff Thomas, a leading society
writer: 'They love to see their names in the papers; abroad, they are not
celebrities.'
There is nothing like being rich in a developing country. Even the
moderately well-off can maintain armies of servants, including
white-uniformed nannies to walk the baby and handlers to exercise the dog.
And while strict import laws meant that, until recently, some trappings of
wealth, such as cell phones and smart cars, were unobtainable, even for the
richest, they could still live like kings.
Behind the high brick walls surrounding the estate of 'Baby' Monteiro de
Carvalho, one of Rio's most favoured sons, you encounter mansion after
mansion (one for each of his children) on the long drive until finally
reaching the colonnaded main house, which is like something out of a de
Mille movie.
Brazilian governments have seemed exclusively interested in improving the
lot of the rich, preferring to spend money on subsidies and incentives for
large industry and agriculture rather than social welfare. Monopolies have
been protected, land reform carefully skirted.
The coffee and sugar barons of the past have been replaced by
industrialists, media moguls and bankers, the latter scooping profits from
the soaring inflation rate. Owners of construction companies have also grown
rich from huge development projects at inflated costs which are responsible
for much of the Third World's largest foreign debt.
Proving that crime pays in Brazil, the serious rich also include a fair
number of organised crime bosses, plus corrupt politicians and officials.
Former president Fernando Collor and his frontman, P C Farias, transformed
from a used car salesman to a multi-millionaire, have not let disgrace
interfere with their lifestyles. Orestes Quercia, who recently resigned as
head of Brazil's largest political party, is alleged to have built a fortune
of as much as Dollars 1bn during stints as governor of Sao Paulo.
In spite of Brazil's social apartheid, the serious rich do not let
themselves be troubled by such things as conscience. You will rarely catch
the rich wives of Rio dirtying their hands in good works. As one society
woman told me: 'The poor are always robbing us, my dear, so why should we
give them money ?'

CHILLING GROUND OF 'SECRET RAPTURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rapture seems an unlikely term with which to associate the majority of the 
venal, weak, self-centered characters in David Hare's "The Secret Rapture" at 
South Coast Repertory. The word is not used in the scuba diving sense, as in 
rapture of the deep, although spiritual euphoria is part of the mystery Hare 
attempts to evoke. As he explains it, "The 'secret rapture' is that moment at 
which a nun expects to be united with Christ. In other words, it's death." 
</P>
<P>
If that sends a shiver through you, it should. A kind of chill stalks "The 
Secret Rapture" from the moment light slices through blackout as a woman 
nervously opens a door and is startled to find her sister sitting in the dark 
room. Their father has died; his body is on the bed. Lives will be changed, not 
by the event of death, which is only a trigger, but by the forces of 
interpersonal and public politics that will rush in to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
Hare has not made a secret of his fascination with how larger societal forces 
shape our private ends. He tackled that notion in "Plenty," a psychological 
dissection of post-World War II England seen through the collapse of one woman. 
In "Rapture," he has taken the fallout of Thatcherism and created an unlikely 
morality play through the secular canonization of another. 
</P>
<P>
Of the sisters mentioned earlier, Marion (Bairbre Dowling) is a junior minister 
in a hidebound conservative government while Isobel (Caroline Goodall) is an 
artist. They have only one thing in common: their late father's widow, 
Katherine (Libby Boone), a much younger woman, alcoholic and incapable of 
coping responsibly. She becomes their unequally shared responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Isobel loves, lives and works with Irwin (Simon Templeman), another artist with 
whom she ekes out a contented living. She is interior, tender, idealistic. 
Marion is exterior, self-righteous and, by her own eventual admission, 
incapable of feeling ("I don't have the right equipment"). She is married to 
Tom (Hal Landon Jr.), a born milquetoast and born-again Baptist who heads 
something called Christians in Business. 
</P>
<P>
The road to destruction is subtle, even if Hare's play isn't always. First 
Marion allows Katherine to inflict herself on Isobel. Later Marion and Tom in a 
"Christian" desire to "help," bedevil Isobel's and Irwin's life with 
self-serving temptations that alter chemistries and wreak ultimate chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The play, which achieves this with uneven success, ends with a tortured 
epiphany that won't bear repeating. "Secret Rapture" is not about plot or 
cause, but about effect. It's about the malice of weakness and the 
powerlessness of strength. It's about currents and resistance, humanity and 
honor. In short, it is dangerous, difficult stuff. After such plays as 
"Speed-the-Plow," "Serious Money," "Glengarry Glen Ross," "Palladium Is Moving" 
and even "Other People's Money," "The Secret Rapture" is, as Hare himself 
recognizes, an attempt "to buck the trend. Unfashionably," says he, "I have a 
heroine." 
</P>
<P>
And then some. Under David Emmes' spare and precise direction, the production 
at SCR is a part of Orange County's ongoing Festival of Britain. The design 
team and the cast are a hands-across-the-sea mixer, with the excellent Goodall 
and Templeman hailing from England, along with set designer Robert Jones, whose 
supply of ever-changing, meticulously detailed locales would seem to defy the 
logistics of storage and wing space. 
</P>
<P>
Boone is a vibrant manic-depressive as Katherine, and Dowling's Marion is 
shrill and obnoxious enough in her tailored suits to conjure up the inevitable 
associations. Elizabeth Dennehy provides some entertaining man-eating moments 
as her shallow assistant Rhonda, while Landon's apologetic piety and limpness 
seem a loaded act of perpetual self-erasure. But the play pivots around the 
complex Isobel and, only because he is so inextricably the instrument of her 
fate, around Irwin. Templeman manages to embody weakness with plenty of 
presence, while Goodall's generous and inviting Isobel thoroughly eludes 
self-pity. 
</P>
<P>
This is a play destined to arouse polemics, but it is curious to recall that it 
did so earlier this year for the wrong reasons, when Hare challenged New York 
Times critic Frank Rich to a duel of words after Rich reacted negatively to the 
New York production Hare had directed. Rich declined, but the furor persisted 
-- unfortunately so. The play deserves to be talked about not for its Rich 
review, but for the richness of its content.

<HEAD>Royal Family Gets Pay Increase of 4.6 Percent, Below Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II and her family got a pay
increase in Tuesday's annual budget of 4.6 percent, which was lower
than inflation but still means they will cost the taxpayers $10.6
million.
   The increase of 273,000 pounds ($466,800) brought the total to
6,195,300 pounds ($10,594,000), and was too much for some Labor
Party legislators whatever its relation to the cost of living.
   ``For the royal family, it looks as though Christmas has come
early,'' Labor member Max Madden said in the House of Commons.
   An increase of 4.6 percent for the Civil List, as the royal
allowances are known, compares with annual inflation of 7.5 percent,
up from 3.3 percent a year ago.
   Members of the royal family are paid for carrying out such
official duties as receiving ambassadors, presenting awards, opening
hospitals, visiting the armed forces and making foreign tours.
   Most of the money goes to salaries for the 350 royal household
staff, from private secretaries to coachmen, gardeners and window
cleaners at Buckingham Palace and the other royal residences.
   Queen Elizabeth, rich in in her own right, will receive 4.65
million pounds ($7.96 million) in the 1989-90 fiscal year, up from
4.55 million pounds.
   Her 88-year-old mother, Queen Mother Elizabeth, will get 404,000
pounds ($691,000), and Prince Philip, her husband, will be paid
225,300 pounds ($385,000).
   The queen's youngest son Prince Edward, 25, who quit the Royal
Marines and now works as a production assistant for a theater
company run by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, does not get a raise.
He has received 20,000 pounds ($34,200) a year since 1982.
   Prince Charles, heir to the throne, and his wife Diana are not on
the list because he is Prince of Wales and lives on income from the
Duchy of Cornwall estates. That amounted to 1.4 million pounds ($2.4
million) last year.
   The largest percentage raise was for the queen's second son,
Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a naval lieutenant on a destroyer. His
state allowance rises from 86,500 pounds ($148,000) to 155,400
pounds (nearly $266,000), or more than 79 percent. He also will get
21,000 pounds (nearly $36,000) in service pay plus allowances.
   Andrew has been accused of taking too much leave and not handling
enough royal duties to justify his allowance.
   Madden called the raise a ``monster increase'' that would ``amaze
and astonish'' most people, who he said would not find much benefit
for themselves in the budget.
   Andrew's raise will pay for his office at Buckingham Palace,
established in 1986 when he married Sarah Ferguson, now Duchess of
York. Their staff includes a private secretary, a full-time
lady-in-waiting, up to four clerks, a chauffeur and a dresser to
look after the duchess's clothes.
   Labor legislator Chris Mullin said the royal family should pay
tax on their state grants and claimed the queen could afford it
because she is ``one of the richest people in the world.''
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said
she pays the equivalent of 80 percent tax on the income from her
estates and invested wealth, double the top rate of her richest
subjects.
   ``The queen is the most heavily taxed person in Britain,'' he
said, and estimated royal revenues at 50 million pounds ($85.5
million) a year, of which the queen would retain 10 million pounds
($17.1 million).
   ``That is the same as being taxed at 80 percent,'' Brooks-Baker
said.
   In the time of King George III in the 18th century, he said,
monarchs found they could not live on their income and agreed to
surrender all revenues in return for the Civil List, a sum
Parliament deemed sufficient for their needs.
   Each monarch since has opted for the Civil List at the start of a
new reign, but because today's royal revenues are much greater than
before, the queen has been allowed to keep a portion, Brooks-Baker
said.

<HEAD>Tsutsumi Heads Forbes List of Billionaires for Second Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yoshiaki Tsutsumi is a bit poorer than he was
last year _ make that less wealthy _ but the Japanese railroad
magnate still ranks as the world's richest person, according to
Forbes magazine.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal
net worth of at least $18.9 billion, making him the world's richest
person for the second straight year, Forbes said Thursday.
   The magazine, in a report on the richest people outside the
United States, estimated Tsutsumi's fortune at approximately $20
billion last fall in its first survey of the world's richest people.
   The story appears in the magazine's July 25 issue.
   The designation for Tsutsumi again puts Forbes at odds with
Fortune magazine. In its compilation of the world's billionaires
last October, Fortune estimated Tsutsumi's holdings in railroads,
hotels and golf clubs were worth a far smaller _ but still
substantial _ $2.5 billion.
   The second richest person on Forbes' list is also Japanese.
Taikichiro Mori, a former economics professor who owns 68 office
buildings in Tokyo, is worth $18 billion, the magazine estimated.
In the previous survey, Mori's fortune was put at $15 billion.
   Following the two Japanese are the Reichmann brothers of Canada,
who have built a $9 billion fortune in real estate, Forbes said.
   Shin Kyuk-ho, a South Korean with interests in candy making,
hotels and real estate, is ranked No. 4 ($8 billion-plus), and
Kenneth Cole Irving, a Canadian with interests in oil distribution,
paper and land, is No. 5 ($8 billion).
   The survey identifies 119 non-American individuals or families
around the world whose personal net assets are worth more than $1
billion, up from 90 in the previous list.
   The United States still accounts for more billionaires than any
other country, Forbes noted. The magazine said at least 47 American
individuals and 20 U.S. families are worth more than $1 billion,
compared with 32 individuals and families in second-place Japan and
16 in third-ranked West Germany.
   The leading American billionaire is Sam Walton, the head of
major retailer Wal-Mart Stores, who ranks seventh worldwide with a
net worth of $6.5 billion, Forbes estimates.
   Not all the fortunes listed in Forbes' list were amassed in a
respectable way.
   Three of them belong to people the magazine identified as
Colombian drug dealers, two individuals and one family, who are all
part of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Two of the Colombian cocaine fortunes, those of Pablo Escobar
Gaviria and the Ochoa family, are each more than $2 billion, Forbes
said. It estimated the third, amassed by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
at between $1.3 billion and $3 billion.

   Six of the 10 richest people in the world are
Japanese but the United States still leads the world in the total
number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes
magazine.
   For the third straight year, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list
of private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much
as it had been 12 months earlier.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net
worth of at least $15 billion _ nearly $4 billion less than
estimated last summer due mainly to a rise in the value of the
dollar against other major currencies, Forbes said Sunday.
   The estimate was far greater than the $2.8 billion that Fortune
magazine placed as Tsutsumi's worth in its September 1988 ranking of
those it considered the world's richest people.
   In last year's list, Forbes estimated Tsutsumi's net worth as
$18.9 billion.
   The magazine reports in its July 24 issue that Tsutsumi edged out
second-ranked Taikichiro Mori by less than $1 billion.
   Mori, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings
in Tokyo, has an estimated net worth of $14.2 billion. In last
year's survey, Forbes placed Mori's worth at about $18 billion.
   The third-richest on the list was American Sam Moore Walton,
founder of the third-largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. Walton and his family are worth an estimated $8.7
billion, up from Forbes' 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.
   After the Waltons came Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of the
Olympia &amp; York real estate empire, with a combined net worth of
about $8 billion.
   The rest of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and
industries, according to Forbes, were: Shin Kyuk-ho, South Korea,
candy, real estate, $8 billion; Hirotomo Takei and family, Japan,
publishing, real estate, $7.8 billion; Kitaro Watanabe, Japan, real
estate, hotels, $7 billion-plus; Haruhiko Yoshimoto and family,
Japan, real estate, $7 billion; Hans and Gad Rausing, Sweden,
liquids packaging, $7 billion; and Eitaro Itoyama, Japan, land, $6.6
billion.
   Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the
world with personal assets worth more than $1 billion.
   The United States was the country with the most billionaires,
with 55 individuals qualifying for that title. Japan ranked second,
with 41, and West Germany was third with 20.
   American also accounted for the most billionaires in the 1988
survey, 47, followed by Japan's 32 and West Germany's 16.
   Among the richest of the world's rich are people who didn't
necessarily come by their money in an honest way.
   Colombia's cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away
piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit
margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years.
   Three of them made Forbes ``World Billionaires'' list, including
Pablo Escobar Gaviria, leader of the notorious Medellin cocaine
cartel, with an estimated personal net worth of $3 billion. The
other cocaine kingpins on the list were the Ochoa family, worth more
than $2 billion, and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, with more than $1
billion.
   In compiling its list, Forbes does not consider royal families
and heads of state ``because their wealth derives more from
political heritage than from economic effort _ theirs are feudal
fortunes, not capitalistic ones.''
   The magazine also excludes dictators, such as Cuba's Fidel Castro
or North Korea's Kim Il Sung.

   Six of the 10 richest people in the world are
Japanese but the United States still leads the world in the total

   For the third year running, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list of
private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much as

   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net

CHANEL A WOMAN OF HER OWN BY AXEL MADSEN (HENRY HOLT: $19.95; 364 PP.; 
0-8050-0961-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rose-Marie Turk, Turk is a fashion writer for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few fashion designers have left a legacy as permanent, as rich or as imitated 
as that of Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel. Her creations -- exquisite little black 
dresses, collarless jackets trimmed with gold buttons and braid, black-tipped 
spectator pumps, quilted handbags, the understated floral notes of Chanel No. 5 
-- remain benchmarks of superb, elegant taste. 
</P>
<P>
Dark, thin, pretty Gabrielle Chanel rose from nowhere to become the reigning 
priestess of streamlined high-fashion for almost 60 years. 329) But for all her 
fame and fortune, her string of impressive lovers and her powerful influence on 
style, she died a lonely woman -- determined to take to the grave as much of 
her story as she could. 
</P>
<P>
"She made up things," Axel Madsen says immediately. "She reinvented her 
childhood. . . . After she became rich, she paid off her brothers to pretend 
they didn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, she was ashamed of her initial poverty and the fact that her 
parents, itinerant market peddlers, were unmarried when she was born. During 
her life she would claim she was raised by old-maid aunts. But in reality, 
after her mother died and her father disappeared, 12-year-old Chanel and her 
two sisters were placed in an orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
When she was 21, working as a seamstress and residing in the military town of 
Moulins, Chanel met Etienne Balsan, a rich bachelor with a passion for 
racehorses. She spent six years as mistress of his estate, Royallieu, where she 
learned to ride, to mix with society and to set herself apart. Instead of 
wearing ready-made millinery, she bought straw boaters, intended for 
schoolboys, and trimmed them with ribbons and lace. Soon she was making hats 
for other women in her circle. 
</P>
<P>
At Royallieu, she was introduced to Arthur (Boy) Capel, a wealthy Englishman 
who became the love of her life. After they ran off to Paris together, Chanel 
opened the millinery shop of her dreams -- thanks to Balsan (a truly good 
sport), who lent her an apartment for the venture, and to Capel, who helped 
finance it. 
</P>
<P>
Next came a boutique on Rue Cambon, the street where Chanel Inc. can be found 
today, followed by another in Deauville. There, Madsen says, "she invented 
sports clothes" and became the first designer to turn wool jersey -- considered 
too lifeless for anything but underwear -- into chic sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
Step by step, her professional life soared. But long-lasting love eluded her. 
(She would always maintain she had never wanted to marry and lose her 
independence.) Boy Capel wed an English aristocrat and died in an automobile 
accident while in France and planning to see Chanel one more time. The Duke of 
Westminster, her lover for 10 years, also left her for an English aristocrat -- 
one who could bear him a child, which Chanel could not. Her friends gossiped 
that she would marry Paul Iribe, but the artist and set designer collapsed and 
died on her tennis court in the middle of a game. 
</P>
<P>
Chanel's whole life was a tough game of chance in which she won more often than 
she lost. For years, the deal she struck with Pierre and Paul Wertheimer for 
Chanel No. 5 was the bane of her existence, but it eventually proved a godsend: 
The Wertheimers bankrolled her return to fashion in 1954 after a 15-year 
absence. The French spurned the collection, calling it passe, but when it 
received rave reviews in America, Chanel's career was reborn. Even her alleged 
collaboration with the Nazis during World War II was swept under the carpet 
because she supposedly knew too many British secrets to go on trial. Her 
suspected collaboration was tied to a wartime romance with German diplomat Hans 
Gunther von Dincklage ("Spatz" to his friends) and her insistance on living at 
the Ritz Hotel along with the occupying Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Her escapades and her pals -- such as Colette, Cocteau, Diaghilev and 
Stravinsky -- were never short on glamour and intrigue. Yet Madsen paints a 
dull, confusing picture. On page after page, the reader finds little more than 
a jumbled band of colorless stick figures, borrowed heavily from previous 
biographers, such as Paul Morand. 
</P>
<P>
If, as Madsen often repeats, Chanel was determined to remain a mystery; if she 
sent away in abject confusion even those to whom she chose to tell some of her 
story, why does he try his hand nearly 20 years after her death? With nothing 
fresh to contribute, he has woven an awkward, ill-fitting tale of a woman who 
devoted her life to magnificently constructed garments -- and to secrecy.

   A spokesman for Prince Turki bin Abdul
Aziz of Saudi Arabia would like you to know the prince is a fairly
regular guy.
   Even if he owns several homes and palaces, has a staff of 4,000
and belongs to the second-richest family in the world.
   With an entourage of nearly 100 people and a tractor-trailer
filled with luggage, that's a tough sell when you pull into a hotel
_ as the royal family did here four weeks ago _ at a cost of about
$10,000 a day.
   Fact and fantasy quickly become blurred.
   Take, for example, the story of a Cambridge police officer on
the special security detail who said that Turki ordered the air
conditioning turned off on the two floors he took over on arriving
at the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square.
   ``They like to keep it like it is in their country. All the cops
working up there are dying,'' said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``A kid told us they even had a space
heater up there.''
   For Mustapha Aziz, the prince's political adviser and spokesman,
the reaction is typical to princes from oil-rich nations such as
Saudi Arabia, under scrutiny since American and other troops were
sent there following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``No, the air-conditioning is not off,'' Aziz said. ``That kind
of stereotype is too much.
   ``Everyone thinks we are coming here with many wives, that kind
of thing. It does not apply to this family. ... He is out of that
picture of greedy princes.''
   Still, the 53-year-old prince's penchant for frequent travel and
long stays at expensive hotels is unusual.
   The youngest of King Fahd's six brothers, Turki has no business
dealings, lives off his inheritance and does largely philanthropic
work. He travels with a staff of 60 to 100, including seven cooks.
The costs of about 40 to 50 rooms at the Charles to house workers
and set up offices with facsimile machines, telephones and a
satellite dish may exceed $10,000.
   Aziz said that is not a big entourage for a member of the Fahd
family, which is worth $18 billion and is the second richest-family
in the world, according to Fortune magazine. ``We have three full
shifts,'' he said.
   Another police officer said the prince, who has his own security
detail, also hired two dozen Cambridge officers at $200 per day.
   ``That's for each man,'' said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``And he's got about eight Harvard cops and
some other guys.''
   The officer said when the prince's 11-year-old son wanted to
play video games one day, he was escorted to an arcade by four
police officers.
   ``The kid had $300 in quarters with him,'' he added.
   Aziz could not confirm or deny those reports. Nor could he hide
his irritation.
   ``The prince does not like to show off. He gives hundreds of
donations every month, but he refuses to be identified as the man
who gave it. His is not the Trump style,'' said Aziz.
   Aziz said that had the Iraqi invasion not occurred, few would
have known he was in town to discuss contributions to Harvard and
have his three children get medical checkups.
   At a recent news conference to discuss events in the Mideast,
the prince was affable but unassuming. But the breakfast he offered
for reporters was certainly one befitting a prince.
   There was cheese _ brie, camembert, saga blue and port salut; a
dozen fruits; six fruit juices; smoked salmon with caviar; petit
filet mignon; Belgium waffles; poached eggs on pumpernickel muffin
with basil hollandaise; two preparation stations for egg dishes,
and a full Mideast menu.
   Waiters presented a long-stemmed red rose to each woman in
attendance. And it was all set off by 750 orchids.
   Like her husband, Princess Hend wore Western clothes.
   She made headlines years ago when she got in a melee with police
checking out reports of mistreatment of workers at the prince's
home in Florida. That's the house where the family created a stir
with a lavish birthday party for his son that included a cake
topped off with live flamingos.
   At one point in the news conference, the princess, whose English
is good, interrupted to say the translator had mangled the exchange
between a reporter and the prince. He tried again.
   ``Her royal highness is the type who likes to speak her mind.
Everyone in the media try to harm this image,'' said Aziz. ``She is
the type of woman for our future.''

<TEXT>
   On a continent where kings were once
revered as gods, Asia's half-dozen surviving monarchies include a
diverse clutch of modernizing kings and a sultan who wields absolute
power.
   King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, the world's longest reigning
monarch following the death Jan. 7 of Japan's Emperor Hirohito, has
initiated several thousand rural projects and spends much of each
year in the countryside personally helping peasants to design
irrigation canals, improve crops and combat disease.
   Aside from Thailand and Japan, monarchs also reign in Nepal and
Bhutan in the Himalayias, Brunei on Borneo, and Malaysia in
Southeast Asia.
   Unlike his remote predecessors in Nepal, Harvard-educated King
Birendra criss-crosses his mountainous nation and has set a goal of
fulfilling the basic needs of an impoverished populace by the year
2000.
   In the kingdom of Bhutan, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk pores over
economic development plans and almost daily deals with petitions
submitted by subjects.
   Hirohito, whose funeral will be held Feb. 24, is widely credited
with having helped Japan's postwar economic miracle by preserving
national unity and traditional virtues through his symbolic role.
But the late emperor, who renounced his divinity after Japan's
defeat in World War II, spent most of his 62 years on the
Chrysanthemum Throne behind the walls of Tokyo's Imperial Palace.
   His son and successor, Emperor Akihito, 55, broke with tradition
by marrying a commoner and has travelled with his family by train,
thrown out the first ball at baseball games and mixed with his
fellow Japanese at numerous public functions.
   Though he is expected to breach some of the barriers between
emperor and subjects, Akihito is unlikely to interact as intimately
with his subjects and their daily problems as do the other Asian
royals _ nor wield anywhere near as much tangible power.
   The most powerful and richest of the continent's five remaining
hereditary monarchs is Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, an absolute
ruler who resides in a 1,788-room palace and keeps some of his 200
horses in air-conditioned stables. Fortune magazine in the United
States last year named him the world's richest man, with assets
estimated at $25 billion.
   Besides being head of state, he is also prime minister and
defense minister and has included two of his brothers in the Cabinet
to help rule over the oil-rich nation about the size of Maryland on
the north coast of Borneo island.
   Brunei's sultan harkens back to days when the pomp, pageantry and
proclamations of hundreds of bluebloods _ kings, princes, sultans,
maharajahs, newabs and nizams _ were as vital a part of Asia as its
rice fields.
   But by mid-century, royal ranks had been thinned by communist
revolutions, independence struggles and the spread of Western
democracy. Other crowns have toppled in more recent times.
   The last emperor of China abdicated in 1912. Communists ended
imperial rule in Vietnam at the end of World War II. India's
independence from Great Britain in 1947 sounded the knell for
myriads of royals. Cambodia's kingdom ended amidst war and chaos in
1970, though Prince Norodom Sihanouk, formerly the king, is still
active as an exiled guerrilla faction leader. The last king of
Afghanistan, Mohammad Zaher Shah, was toppled in 1973 and is exiled
in Italy but recently offered to help in a transitional government
in his country.
   Today, there remain but five Asian hereditary kingdoms and
Malaysia, where every five years one of the country's sultans is
elected a constitutional monarch.
   Nine of Malaysia's 13 states have sultans who are constitutional
heads of the state governments. They have no political power. Every
five years these sultans meet to elect by secret ballot one of
themselves to be the national king. By tacit agreement each state
gets a turn at having its sultan king sooner or later. At the
national level the king is the constitutional head of state but
political power rests with prime minister.
   The present king of Malaysia is Sultan Mahmood Iskandar from
Jahore state. His term expires this year.
   Today's Asian monarchies have deep roots and their forseeable
futures appear secure.
   Akihito is 125th in a line of emperors said to stretch back 2,600
years in Japan. Though historians regard the first 14 emperors as
figures of myth, the Japanese imperial line is still the world's
oldest hereditary monarchy, and current public opinion polls favor
its continuation.
   Bhumibol, probably the most respected man in Thailand, is heir to
750 years of monarchy.
   Bolkiah is Brunei's 29th ruler while Nepal and Bhutan both have
centuries-old royal traditions.
   Although a constitutional monarch, the 61-year-old Thai king is
regarded as semi-divine by some and widely viewed as having held the
country together in wake of the coups and abortive power grabs that
have marked recent decades. He openly intervened to stop a serious
student-led uprising in 1973 and has in other moments of national
crisis played a decisive behind-the-scenes role.
   Named king in 1946 and crowned four years later, when he was a
jazz-loving teen-ager, Bhumibol was initially viewed as someone to
be used by military strongmen. Instead, he gradually reversed the
decline in prestige of the throne, largely by by-passing the elite
to work for the mass of have-nots in the countryside.
   Nepal's Birendra, 43, likewise has sought links with the rural
poor, making frequent trips to remote areas to hand out relief
supplies and sound out the problems of villagers. But knowledgable
sources in Nepal and neighboring India say much of the effort is
negated by corruption within the royal family and its retainers _ an
open secret in Katmandu, the capital.
   Birendra has initiated some political reforms during his 16-year
rule but there are quiet critics of both the monarchy and limited
democratic rights. The king himself, seen as a reincarnation of the
Hindu god Vishnu, by law cannot be criticized.
   In Bhutan, the publicity-shy, 33-year-old King Jigme Singye
Wangchuk has continued his father's attempts at political evolution
and improvement in the lives of his 1.4 million, largely illiterate
people.
   ``Development is important but preserving our culture and our
values is equally important,'' Jigme Singye has said.
   Bhutan was only opened up from its medieval seclusion by his
reform-minded father.
   International aid agencies have been welcomed to Bhutan but mass
tourism has not. Tourism is seen as a destroyer of the old ways
upheld by the king, who always wears the traditional, robe-like
``kho'' _ even while playing basketball _ and is married to four
sisters of noble line, another time-honored custom.
   Brunei's politics are said to be among the most sterile in Asia
but the tiny state's 227,000 people have yet to show significant
signs of discontent. Under the 42-year-old sultan, the country
continues to prosper from its oil and natural gas reserves. Medical
care and education are free and the per capita annual income of
$21,000 is among the highest in the world.
   The sultan, who has snapped up hotels, companies and other
investments around the world, moves freely among his subjects and is
credited with a number of civic improvements.

   The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations is in town for it 22nd meeting and the streets are
bedecked with bunting, so why do the decorations feature the number
43 instead of 22?
   Because the bunting isn't for the delegates; it's for the sultan,
who turns 43 on July 15.
   The sultan, who has 37 words in his name and title, is worth $30
billion and takes very good care of the 241,000 people over whom he
has absolute sway.
   He is Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan and Yang
Di-Pertuan Negeri Brunei Awang Muda Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'issaddin
Waddaulah Ibni Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan
Awang Muda Omar Ali Aifuddin Saifuddin Sa'adul Khairi Waddin.
   Most people just call him Sir Hassanal Bolkiah.
   His sultanate, 2,226 square miles on the north coast of Borneo,
sits on a huge pool of oil and natural gas.
   The Guinness Book of World Records says Sir Hassanal is the
world's richest individual becauwe oil income and foreign currency
reserves totaling almost $30 billion are ``effectively at his
disposal.''
   Fortune magazine confirmed his enormous wealth and said King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia was second with $18 billion.
   Secular, religious and military power rest with the sultan, a
hereditary ruler who is head of state, prime minister, defense
minister and commander of the armed forces.
   One of his brothers is in charge of foreign affairs and another
heads the Finance Ministry of this former British protectorate,
which became fully independent five years ago.
   As well as being the richest person in the world, Sir Hassanal
lives with his relatives in the world's biggest palace _ a complex
of buildings built with 38 types of marble on a 300-acre hill near
the Brunei River.
   In case friends decide to stay over, it has 1,778 rooms and 257
toilets. There are 564 chandeliers, 18 elevators, 44 staircases and
a banquet hall that seats 4,000.
   His majesty's polo ponies have air-conditioned quarters.
   More than 2,000 workers completed the Istana (palace) Nurul Imam
for independence in 1984 and the sultan never said how much it cost.
Guesses at the time started at $250 million, but suppliers who know
what went into it _ including 22-carat gold tiles on interior arches
_ say at least $600 million.
   The sultan has two wives. He was married first to Her Majesty the
Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha and then to Her Royal Highness
Pengiran Isteri Hajjah Mariam. He has three sons and six daughters.
Saleha, the sultan's first cousin, resides in the Nurul Imam.
   Mariam (born Mariam Bell) keeps house in a smaller and newer
palace, Nurulizza, 14 miles from the capital. Their marriage caused
a rift between the sultan and his father, Sir Omar, because she was
a commoner and part Japanese. Japan occupied Brunei during World War
II. The sultan met Mariam when she was a hostess on the Royal Brunei
Airlines.
   The royal family, in power for 29 generations, ensures continued
support for autocracy by providing subsidized food, fuel, housing
and free education and medical care. There is no personal income tax.
   Shortly after independence, Sir Hassanal was quoted as saying his
subjects enjoyed ``a good life. Why should they want more?''
   Bruneians seem content. The happiest probably are the civil
servants, who make up 46 percent of the work force of 85,000. Along
with standard benefits, they get free pensions and interest-free
loans to buy cars and houses.
   Traffic jams are common in Brunei, which has one car for every
2.3 people.
   Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, the foreign minister, told reporters
covering the conference: ``The people seem to be very happy with the
way we are running things. The people accept it.''
   They certainly are spared worries that trouble the foreigners
here assembled. There is no national debt, no trade deficit, no
balance of payments problem and the budget always shows a surplus.
Oil and natural gas account for 99 percent of exports.
   Sir Hassanal was attending Sandhurst Military College in Britain
when his father abdicated in 1967 and he was summoned home at age 21
to take the throne.
   Sultan Omar continued to run things from behind the scenes for
another 15 years, however, and the polo-playing young potentate took
the opportunity to build an international reputation as a playboy.
   Brunei's last flirtation with an elected parliament was in 1962,
when it was still a British protectorate.
   The Parti Rakyat Brunei, since outlawed, won all 16 seats on the
Legislative Council. Sultan Omar refused to convene the council and
an uprising ensued.
   Britain crushed the rebellion and a state of emergency declared
at the time remains in force.

<HEAD>Obscure Royal Relative Claims His Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hitherto unknown relative of Queen Elizabeth II
has placed one foot out of obscurity, claiming his father was the
product of an illicit love affair between a dashing aristocrat and
a lady-in-waiting, a blueblood chronicler says.
   The relative is a 49-year-old engineer whose first name is
Anthony. He lives with his wife and two teen-age children in a
modest three-bedroom house in a suburb of Manchester in northern
England. But that's all he wants the public to know.
   Anthony says he is the queen's second cousin, once removed, and
according to Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's
Peerage, ``he is her closest illegitimate documented relative.''
   Brooks-Baker said Anthony's grandfather was Charles Bowes-Lyon,
a first cousin of the queen's mother, Queen Mother Elizabeth.
   ``Anthony wants his family to be included in Burke's Peerage
along with his noble ancestors,'' Brooks-Baker said. ``He wants his
children to be received by the Bowes-Lyon family.''
   He stepped forward when Burke's Peerage, known as the blueblood
bible, announced a year ago that it intended to begin listing the
illegitimate offspring of nobility and royalty in future editions.
   Burke's Peerage authenticated Anthony's royal links through his
birth certificate, letters and photographs, but respected his wish
to remain anonymous.
   Anthony feared public recognition might destroy his family's
quiet lifestyle and has asked to be listed as ``The Unknown
Royal,'' Brooks-Baker said.
   Britain's tabloid newspapers have offered him up to $85,000 for
exclusive rights to his story, but Anthony has refused,
Brooks-Baker said.
   ``He has refused all monies,'' Brooks-Baker said. ``He is an
unbelievably shy man and is far from rich, but he has no problems
financially.''
   In 1908, Bowes-Lyon, a second lieutenant in the British army,
``fell passionately in love with this attractive woman who was a
sort of companion to his aunt'' at the family's stately home,
Ridley Hall, in northeast England, Brooks-Baker said.
   A year later, they had a child and asked permission to marry,
``but a marriage between somebody of that station and a
lady-in-waiting was really out of the question,'' he said.
   Bowes-Lyon was sent to Canada for three years ``to recover from
this great love,'' and the mother and child went to live at her
family's home in Cheshire in northwest England, he said.
   The child, Charles, was registered as a Lindsay, the
lieutenant's mother's maiden surname.
   Brooks-Baker said Bowes-Lyon's love for the woman never faded,
and that he possibly planned to marry her. But World War I
intervened, and he was killed in battle in France on Oct. 23, 1914.
   Illegitimate children ``cannot claim their full share of an
inheritance'' but the Bowes-Lyon family ``looked after the child,''
Brooks-Baker said.
   They paid for his schooling and, when he turned 18, sent his
mother 600 pounds (then about $2,700) in Canadian railway stocks to
help him set up in business.
   ``That is one of the best examples I know of the aristocratic
tradition of accepting illegitimacy in an understanding and
Christian way,'' Brooks-Baker said.
   Charles later married and had a son, Anthony. He ended up a
shopkeeper in the English Midlands, where he died in 1976.
   Brooks-Baker said the Bowes-Lyon family gathered Friday to
discuss Anthony's claim to his past and ``there's no question about
anyone denying it.''

FT  27 NOV 92 / Queen will start to pay income tax from April: Decision seen
as move towards a smaller, European-style monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEEN ELIZABETH II has heralded the most sweeping reform of the British
monarchy since her accession 40 years ago by agreeing to pay income tax and
to support financially all but three members of her family.
Her decision amounts to a move towards a smaller continental European-style
monarchy. It was announced by Mr John Major just two days after the Queen
hinted that she recognised public dissatisfaction over the cost - and
behaviour - of her family. The prime minister said the move came at her
initiative.
The Queen is said to be the richest woman in the world with investments
alone estimated at Pounds 50m. From next April she will pay tax on her
private income at the 40 per cent top rate. She will probably also pay
inheritance and capital gains tax - but under arrangements still to be
decided because normally her wealth could be wiped out on her death.
Discussions are taking place between the Treasury, the Inland Revenue and
the Royal Household before a fuller statement early next year. The Prince of
Wales is likely to pay more tax on income from the Duchy of Cornwall. After
escaping paying the poll tax, the Queen will pay the council tax on her
Sandringham and Balmoral homes.
From next year only the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh
will be paid incomes out of the 'civil list' voted by parliament. At present
the Queen receives Pounds 7.9m, the Queen Mother Pounds 643,000 and the Duke
of Edinburgh Pounds 359,000 from the civil list.
The salaries drawn by five other members of the royal family will be
reimbursed to the public purse. Buckingham Palace said the five - the
Queen's three younger children, her sister Princess Margaret, and her
90-year-old aunt Princess Alice - will go on performing public duties.
Although the Inland Revenue will keep details of royal finances secret, as
for any taxpayer, and even though taxes were paid by Queen Victoria, George
V and Edward VII, the move marks a watershed for the monarchy.
It was seen at Westminster as an attempt to restore the monarchy's
reputation after, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis dominated by
rumours about royal marriages and rows over its extravagance. The political
debate over who should pay to restore the fire-damaged Windsor Castle may
have led to the changes being announced.
Moreover, the Queen, in whose name the Inland Revenue collects taxes has
become liable herself. Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West, said she could
have created an extra 25 jobs for tax inspectors at the Inland Revenue's
high-security unit in Cardiff.
The announcement came in pre-scripted exchanges in the Commons between Mr
Major and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who had been briefed on Tuesday.
Mr Smith asked the prime minister if, 'in view of the evident public
concern', he had had discussions with the Queen about her finances.
Mr Major replied that 'affection and respect' for the monarch were
widespread and the sovereign was not liable to pay tax on her personal
income. 'But Her Majesty some months ago, before the summer recess,
indicated to me that she wished consideration to be given to changing these
arrangements.'
The Queen will not be taxed on sums voted by MPs to cover costs of items
such as royal flights and trains, which totalled Pounds 57m last year. But
she will pay tax on private income from the Duchy of Lancaster. The Prince
of Wales already pays tax on his private income and voluntarily contributes
25 per cent of income from the Duchy of Cornwall.

   British actress Jane Seymour says she found
much to admire in Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee who became
the duchess of Windsor, the woman the English loved to hate.
   ``She was the woman who stole their king,'' says Seymour, who
portrays Simpson in the CBS movie, ``The Woman He Loved.''
   ``They hated her. She was a naive American who didn't understand
the monarchy or how it worked or what it stood for. She thought
David could make her his queen.''
   Instead, David, already King Edward VIII but not yet crowned,
was forced to abdicate in 1936 to marry Wallis. They became the
duke and duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in
exile.
   The two-hour movie, which CBS will televise on Sunday, also
stars Anthony Andrews as David, Olivia de Havilland as Wallis' Aunt
Bessie, Julie Harris as her mother, Lucy Gutteridge as another
woman who saw herself as David's queen, Robert Hardy as Winston
Churchill and Phyllis Calvert as Queen Mary.
   ``I've never heard anyone say a good word about her,'' Seymour
says. ``Other than that, she gave great dinner parties. But I liked
her. She had a sense of humor, a straightforwardness. She was
definitely attentive to her husband and, although she was no
beauty, she had style and elegance. I certainly wouldn't trust her
with my husband.
   ``It's boring to play a perfect person. But to play a woman who
was not liked and to find something about her that is likeable is
fascinating.''
   Seymour says she saw David as a weak man who never really wanted
to be king. Wallis Simpson fulfilled some of his needs.
   ``Rumor has it that Wallis learned to do sexual tricks when she
lived in China,'' she says. ``The king had a few problems in that
area and she fixed them.''
   When Wallis first met David, he was the prince of Wales and she
was married to American businessman Ernest Simpson. The flirtation
turned to romance, and Simpson's marriage to divorce. Her plan was
to marry David and become queen, but the British prime minister and
royal family forbade his marriage as king to a twice-divorced woman.
   ``The Woman He Loved'' takes a different and less political
approach than the British-made miniseries ``Edward and Mrs.
Simpson,'' which ran on PBS several years ago.
   English newspapers became heavily involved with the making of
``The Woman He Loved'' and Seymour says one paper seemed to give
royal status to her role-playing. The Times published Seymour's
picture as the duchess at David's funeral. It went on the Court
Circular Page, a serious chronicle of royal events.
   ``I tried to play her in various shades of gray,'' Seymour says.
``I play her the way I believe she was thinking at the time. She
was manipulating things. She had a great plan and it didn't work. I
purposely don't play her sympathetically.''
   Parts of the movie were filmed in western England, where Seymour
owns a 15th-century estate outside the old Roman spa city of Bath.
She stayed at her home, St. Catherine's Court, during that time.
   Seymour divides her time between England, where she is still a
citizen, and this country, where she has lived for the past 10
years. She and her husband, American businessman David Flynn, have
two children, Katie, 5, born here, and Sean, 2, born in England.
   She works mostly in American television and films, having shed
her English accent in order to play American roles.
   Seymour was on her way to Spain to play opera star Maria Callas
in the ABC miniseries ``Onassis: The Richest Man in the World.''
The four-hour miniseries, which tells of the romance between Callas
and Greek magnate Aristotle Onassis (Raul Julia), will be televised
in early May.
   She has already completed her role as Natalie Jastrow Henry in
``War and Remembrance,'' the 30-hour miniseries being readied for
ABC next season. So far she has starred in 10 American miniseries.
   ``This seems to be my `duchess and diva' period,'' she says with
a laugh. ``I seem to be getting some great roles now. It's very
exciting. I'm like a chameleon, changing the way I look, the way I
sound, the kind of roles I play.''
   She took over the role played by Ali MacGraw in ``The Winds of
War,'' the first of author Herman Wouk's two massive novels on
World War II.
   For her role as Maria Callas she had to learn to sing several
arias. She also worked with dialect coach Robert Easton for her
roles as Wallis Simpson and Maria Callas.
   Next, she goes to London for a role in the CBS miniseries ``Jack
the Ripper.'' She plays the romantic interest to Michael Caine, who
stars as Scotland Yard Inspector Frederick Abberline. Armand
Assante also stars as an American actor playing ``Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde'' on the London stage at the time of Jack the Ripper's
reign of terror.

   A man ranked the wealthiest
in the world runs this tiny oil-rich Moslem kingdom, and diplomats
report little dissent from people unencumbered by income taxes,
medical payments or tuition fees.
   King Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah rules the enclave on the
northeastern tip of Borneo from his 1,788-room palace. Earlier this
month, Fortune magazine called him the richest man in the world,
worth $25 billion.
   Citizens of this southeast Asian nation do not appear to object
to the king's rule because he spreads some of the money around.
   ``They (the people) are well looked after, with free education,
medical treatment, cheap housing, good pensions and any one doing
well in his studies can easily get a university education abroad at
the government's expense,'' said one diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He said there are no beggars, and about half the workforce is
employed by the government. The per capita income is estimated at
about $18,000, one of the highest in the world, according to
bankers and diplomats.
   All the money comes from oil and gas, which Brunei exports
mainly to Japan.
   A Brunei government official said recently that 1986 exports
amounted to $2.03 billion _ 99 percent of it oil and gas. Imports
for the same year totaled $785 million in cars, foodstuffs and
other goods.
   The nation, about the size of Delaware, covers just 2,226 square
miles, much of which is not suitable for cultivation, an
agricultural officer said.
   Without daily newspapers, the nation's 227,000 people get their
news mainly through state-run radio, Television Brunei and some
government publications.
   An official in the Planning Unit said Malays form the majority
of Brunei's population, but there are also about 60,000 Chinese and
other non-Malays.
   About 87,000 people are employed and of these 28,000 are foreign
workers, including foreign maids, doctors, lawyers, engineers,
accountants and others.
   Brunei has no elected Parliament and Sultan Bolkiah rules the
nation with the help of a Cabinet comprising two of his brothers
and about seven other people.
   The 41-year-old monarch, who studied in neighboring Malaysia
before a stint at the British Military Academy in Sandhurst,
England, in 1966, was crowned the 29th King of Brunei in 1967 by
his father Sir Omar Ali Saifuddin, who abdicated in favor of his
son.
   The king loves polo and has about 200 Argentine polo ponies,
some of which are kept in air-conditioned stables. He has two wives
and six children.
   In the 14th and 15th century, Brunei was a large empire
stretching from the northern Philippines to most parts of Borneo,
but when the colonialists came Brunei shrank. Brunei became a
British protectorate in 1906 and won its independence on Dec. 31,
1983.
   The country has no income tax, gasoline is cheap and there are
no major taxes on cars, which are imported from Japan and
elsewhere. Diplomats estimate foreign reserves at $20 billion.
   The King has powers to detain and hold without trial anyone
deemed to be a threat to the security of the nation. On July 14,
the government released 34 such detainees, leaving just six still
in custody.
   Diplomats say there appears to be no long-term threat to
Brunei's economy as the 120,000 barrels of oil being pumped daily
is expected to last ``well into the next century''.
   Brunei is officially known as Brunei Darusalam.
   Darusalam means abode of peace ``and there is indeed peace
here'' said a diplomat, who added ``they could have added
prosperity to it.''

JAPAN'S TSUTSUMI STILL TOPS FORBES' RICHEST LIST

Six of the 10 richest people in the world are Japanese but the United States 
still leads the world in the total number of billionaires, according to 
estimates compiled by Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
For the third straight year, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list of private 
billionaires even though his wealth wasn't reported to be quite as great as had 
been estimated 12 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net worth of at 
least $15 billion -- nearly $4 billion less than estimated last summer due 
mainly to a rise in the value of the dollar against other major currencies, 
Forbes said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The estimate was far greater than the $2.8 billion that Fortune magazine had 
reported as Tsutsumi's worth in its September, 1988, ranking of those whom it 
considered to be the world's richest people. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's list, Forbes estimated Tsutsumi's net worth at $18.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine reports in its July 24 issue that Tsutsumi edged out second-ranked 
Taikichiro Mori by less than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Mori, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings in Tokyo, has 
an estimated net worth of $14.2 billion. In last year's survey, Forbes placed 
Mori's worth at about $18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walton No. 3 
</P>
<P>
The third-richest on the list was American Sam Moore Walton, founder of the 
third-largest retail operation in the United States, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
Walton and his family are worth an estimated $8.7 billion, up from Forbes' 1988 
estimate of $6.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
After the Waltons came Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of the Olympia &amp; 
York real estate empire, with a combined net worth of about $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and 
industries, according to Forbes, were: Shin Kyuk-ho, South Korea, candy, real 
estate, $8 billion; Hirotomo Takei and family, Japan, publishing, real estate, 
$7.8 billion; Kitaro Watanabe, Japan, real estate, hotels, $7 billion-plus; 
Haruhiko Yoshimoto and family, Japan, real estate, $7 billion; Hans and Gad 
Rausing, Sweden, liquids packaging, $7 billion; and Eitaro Itoyama, Japan, 
land, $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the world with 
personal assets worth in excess of $1 billion.

<HL> Sultan of Brunei to Pay $200 Million
For Beverly Hills Hotel, Sources Say

   The Sultan of Brunei, one of the world's wealthiest men, has agreed to buy the legendary Beverly Hills Hotel from oil tycoon Marvin Davis for more than $200 million, hotel sources said. 

   Mr. Davis purchased the Beverly Hills Hotel, also known as the Pink Palace for its distinctive coloring and its star-studded clientele, from the family of Ivan F. Boesky and others for about $135 million last December. 
The sale followed Mr. Boesky's $100 million settlement of insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

   The hotel sources said Mr. Davis and the Sultan of Brunei have agreed on a price, and the transaction is expected to close sometime next week. 

   Mr. Davis couldn't be reached, and spokesmen for him declined to comment. 

   The purchase of the posh hotel was the jewel in Mr. Davis's growing block of Los Angeles real estate and restored some of the glamour the investor gave up by selling Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. to Rupert Murdoch. 
Mr. Davis also said, after he bought the hotel, that the purchase had personal meaning, because he spent his honeymoon in the hotel and once lived in one of its bungalows. 

   Since the purchase of the hotel, Mr. Davis has frequently presided over breakfasts in the hotel's Polo Lounge, a popular breakfast locale for the entertainment industry. 

   Hotel sources also said they understood the sultan was reportedly a losing bidder in the December sale of the hotel but persisted in trying to buy the hotel from Mr. Davis. 
"The guy finally came back with a price that was so far and away unbelievable that (Mr. Davis) just had to say OK," said one hotel source, adding, "Marvin has a deep personal attachment to the place." 

   Another factor in Mr. Davis's decision to sell the 75-year-old hotel was his discovery that renovation costs would be higher than originally estimated, according to the source. 
Michael Ullman, the hotel's general manager, has said the hotel was planning "substantial renovations" and even the addition of a nightclub. 
Many of the hotel's competitors, including the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, are being renovated. 

   A price-tag for the hotel of more than $200 million wouldn't make a very big dent in the net worth of the sultan. 
In its current issue, Fortune magazine pronounced him the world's richest man, estimating his personal net worth at $25 billion or more. 
The sultan, who rules Brunei, a tiny country on the oil-rich island of Borneo, lives in a 1,788-room palace and owns more than 200 polo ponies, according to the story. 

   The sultan couldn't be reached for comment. 

   The hotel wouldn't be the sultan's first. 
He snapped up London's elegant Dorchester Hotel 2 1/2 years ago for a price that wasn't disclosed from Regent International Hotels of Hong Kong. 
A hotel spokeswoman at the time said the price paid was "certainly in excess" of the $52 million that Regent had paid for the Hyde Park property less than a year earlier. 

   The sultan entered the national spotlight earlier this year when the congressional investigation into the Iran-Contra affair revealed that he had contributed $10 million to the Contra rebels at the request of the Reagan administration. 
That contribution was eventually returned to the Sultan after it was deposited in the wrong Swiss bank account.

<HEAD>Biggest Fortune is Built On Milk Carton</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Ax:son-Johnson is cq in 20th graf</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweden's biggest private fortune was
built on a better milk carton, according to a new survey of wealth
in a country that discourages high incomes.
   The survey, published Wednesday by Affarsvarlden (Business
World), showed the four wealthiest families have left Sweden and
relocated their companies abroad to avoid a tax system designed to
equalize personal income.
   However, the magazine said its list of multimillionaires has
grown from 26 to 163 since its first survey six years ago.
   Thirty-one families were listed as having assets worth more than
one billion kronor. Three families would qualify as billionaires in
dollars. A dollar is worth just under six krona.
   The wealthiest family is headed by Hans and Gad Rausing, the
sons of Ruben Rousing who began producing milk cartons in 1952, and
in 1963 gave the world a flat-topped carton that can be packed and
shipped like bricks.
   Tetra Pak, the company at the base of the family fortune, has
its head office in Switzerland. The Rousing brothers, said the
magazine, are worth up to 30 billion kronor, or $5 billion.
   Second on the list is the family of Ingvar Kamprad who founded
IKEA, a chain store selling cheap do-it-yourself furniture and
accessories.
   Peter Wallenberg, head of Sweden's best known industrial family,
ranked 64th on the list. One distant relative was Raoul Wallenberg,
the diplomat who saved 100.000 Hungarian Jews from Nazi
extermination camps during World War II. He was arrested by the
Soviet army during final days of the war and disappeared.
   King Carl XVI Gustaf just squeezed onto the list in 158th place
with estimated assets of about 100 million kronor, or $16.6 million.
   Sweden's newest billionaire is Per Arwidsson, 35, who took a
small loan from a bank eight years ago and parlayed it into a
fortune on the stock market, the magazine said. He was 31st on the
list.
   Senior Editor Bjorn Franzon said the list was difficult to
compile fairly. ``We tried to evaluate the market value of the
family holdings in listed companies,'' he told the Associated Press.
   ``The situation is a little tricky. We are talking about family
equity because we don't care if the owner has transferred some or
all of his shares to one son or five sons ... for tax purposes,''
said Franzon.
   Most Swedes pay about half their wages in taxes, and the
marginal tax rate on top income brackets goes up to 75 percent.
Inheritance tax can amount to 100 percent, and even more, of an
estate.
   Franzon said the magazine's first survey of the super-rich was
in 1982 when the Social Democrats, who ran Sweden for 50 years,
were returned to power after six years of non-socialist government.
   The quantum leap in the length of the list was only partly due
to the government's economic policy, he said.
   That policy encourages business profits while heavily taxing
private income. Employee benefits and tax-financed government
welfare programs give Swedish workers one of the world's highest
standards of living.
   The growing number of millionaires could be attributed to a real
estate and stock market boom, despite the crash last October, and
by inflation, which pushed up the nominal value of the companies,
Franzon said.
   He acknowledged his earlier list was not as accurate as it
should have been.
   ``I'm a little ashamed to say that our journalism also is
better. We have better resources ... and a better understanding of
the companies,'' he said.
   ``We have 40 or 50 people on the list this time who should have
been on before, but it wasn't possible to find them,'' the editor
added.
   Antonia Ax:son-Johnson, 45, is the only woman listed as head of
a wealthy family, with assets of up to 2.4 billion kronor, or $400
million. She spells her name in a disappearing form of Swedish
abreviation, but the company she inherited is known as
Axelson-Johnson AB, a trading and investment firm which last month
Sweden's largest department store chain to its holdings.
   Franzon said the list is still incomplete, and the magazine has
more to learn. ``My guess is that an accurate list should have many
more real estate people,'' he said.
   Affarsvarlden, a weekly first published in 1901, has a
circulation of 25,000.

   Queen Elizabeth II joined 400th anniversary
celebrations Tuesday of the first Welsh-language Bible, a
translation ordered by her namesake, Elizabeth I.
   The queen participated in a bilingual service at Westminster
Abbey in honor of the 1588 translation as well as an upcoming Bible
which has taken Welsh scholars 26 years to complete.
   She accepted a copy of the 1588 Bible and thanked God ``for the
blessing that his book has been for the Welsh people,'' as 1,500
Welsh and English dignitaries looked on.
   Welsh is still taught in schools in Wales but the number of
native speakers has declined to 64 percent in Welsh-speaking areas
this year from 71.3 percent in 1981, a recent survey has found.
   Wales was brought under English rule in 1282 by King Edward I and
united with England in 1536.

   Former star skier Erika Hess and her
husband are expecting a baby next month, a Swiss magazine reported
Tuesday.
   ``Maybe it will be a Christmas baby,'' Hess, 26, was quoted as
telling Schweizer Illustrierte magazine. The baby is expected Dec.
22 to Dec. 25, she said.
   The magazine featured pictures of Hess and her husband, Jacques
Reymond, outdoors near their home in the Jura Mountains and a photo
of the mother-to-be sitting on a rocking chair indoors, knitting a
sweater for the baby.
   Hess retired from skiing in 1987, after 10 years of competition
during which she won two overall World Cup championships. She
crowned her career with two gold medals in the 1987 Alpine World
Championship.
   Last May she married Reymond, 38, a former trainer for the Swiss
women's ski team.

   The teen-age brother of pop music star
Madonna has been charged with aggravated assault for allegedly
biting a youth's nose at a party.
   Mario Gerard Ciccone, 19, who has been charged with assault in
four separate incidents this year, pleaded innocent Monday.
   The charge stemmed from an Aug. 8 house party at which a
16-year-old boy said he was bitten after allegedly flirting with
Ciccone's girlfriend. The youth received treatment after the wound
became infected.
   Last month, Ciccone was cleared of assault for allegedly slamming
a door in the face of a police officer investigating a loud party.
He faces two other, unrelated assault charges.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Despatches: Dinner for 5,750 please, James - Brunei / Kieran
Cooke sups with a sultan but finds the six-hour wait tedious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WHEN THE richest man in the world issues a dinner invitation, it is best to
be punctual. The sultan of Brunei, estimated to be worth a cool Dollars 37bn
(Pounds 20.7bn) at the last count, was throwing a little anniversary bash
marking his 25 years on the throne.
Dinner was at 7.30. At 5.30, a few select members of the international media
arrived at the palace gates. The sultan is known to be a bit of a stickler
when it comes to dress. Slept-in suits were brushed down. Scuffed shoes were
given a quick wipe. Stained ties were adjusted. The man from Russian TV
looked in need of a snort of vodka.
It was going to be a cosy affair. Just us, the sultan, a sprinkling of Malay
royalty, a layer of heads of state, a few prime ministers added as garnish.
Plus a few thousand other dignitaries, even a few ordinary people. A mere
5,750 altogether, all seated in the same room.
You either hide your wealth or flaunt it. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, 29th
sultan and absolute ruler of Brunei, is not afraid of spending a bob or two.
His palace is described as the biggest in the world. There are nearly 2,000
rooms. There is a throne room that can seat 2,000. Marble covers more than
12 acres of wall. Carpets as lush as newly-fallen snow. Chandeliers that
weigh a ton apiece. Gold that hurts the eyes. Nearly 300 lavatories.
The meal was running late. No one can raise a fork until the sultan gives
the word. We waited. The dining room was a cross between Versailles and high
season at Butlins.
'G'day,' said an Australian waiter, one of more than 700 catering staff
flown in for the occasion. 'Not a bad little party, eh?'
In the kitchens, chefs sweltered and tempers frayed. Plates of prawns
collided with sides of mutton. The meat for the meal was flown in from
Australia where the sultan's ranch is twice the size of Brunei itself.
More waiting. A few of the down top table guests sloped in. Prince Edward -
representing his mother, Britain's Queen Elizabeth - sat in the corner by
the royal serving hatch. A Thai prince smiled serenely at the ceiling. A
Malay princess adjusted a troublesome tiara.
The sultan, still only in his mid-40s, has two wives and 10 children. And a
great deal else besides. Two palaces in Brunei plus a hotel in Singapore and
another which he bought, then sold, to the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), a
secretive organisation that handles an estimated Dollars 35bn of the
country's international investments.
The sultan has a mansion in Malaysia. He owns the Beverly Hills hotel in the
US, plus another couple of houses in Tinseltown.
His father was something of an anglophile who even had a special Winston
Churchill museum built in Brunei. That has been closed but the present
sultan - who spent time at Sandhurst, England's military college for
officers - still maintains strong British links.
He bought the Dorchester hotel in London but sold it recently to the BIA.
There are various flats and houses dotted round the British capital. The
sultan's main residence is a country house situated on the flight path to
Heathrow airport.
The sultan is partial to planes. He bought his own 747 recently and has a
couple of other jets in Brunei. Then there are the automobiles: estimates of
the number of his Rolls-Royces vary between 135 and 157. Plus a whole
starting grid of sports cars.
Dinner was getting very late. There were ugly mutterings from the
international press. No alcohol allowed in this increasingly Islamic state.
Diplomats, dressed in their full regalia, perspired quietly; their wives
glowed.
The sultan loves polo. He flies in whole teams to play special tournaments.
His horses are said to have air-conditioned stables.
Britain has a battalion of Gurkhas stationed in Brunei. The sultan has his
own Gurkha battalion, made up of retired soldiers who now form the palace
guard. Any mutinous sounds from the waiting diners and the kukris might be
out.
Army chaps were the only ones to maintain stiff upper lips throughout the
long wait. They would not even taste a tumbler of water until the sultan -
always referred-to among expatriates as 'HRH' - had first lifted a glass.
It was 9.45 pm when the sultan finally arrived. The whole family was in
attendance. The sultan doubles up as prime minister and minister of defence.
A brother is foreign minister, another is minister of finance.
Sultan, princes, princesses and prime ministers sat down, stock still. Not a
word was spoken. Just the sound of a thousand camera shutters clicking.
The press were ordered back to table. The sultan had given the word. Food
was fallen on. The Russian fantasised about the cold of a Moscow winter.
'And then you drink - like that,' he said, knocking back a pineapple juice.
We rose. 'Tut, tut,' said the army. Dammit all, everyone has to wait till
HRH has finished. We escaped through the kitchens.
'You people have no bloody decorum,' said the Australian waiter, smiling. We
agreed. Six hours of dinner was enough, even if it was with the richest man
in the world.

BEST-SELLING AUTHOR BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD LIVES THE GLAMOROUS LIFESTYLE OF 
HER CHARACTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH VENANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing her well-stocked closet, Barbara Taylor Bradford is caught in a small, 
pleasurable dilemma: What to wear for the evening's dinner party -- the 
elegantly tailored dress designed by a Paris couturier, or the flirtatious 
red-skirted ensemble by her favorite New York designer? 
</P>
<P>
The multimillion-dollar author is deliberating over this embarrassment of 
riches in the living room of her bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of her latest best seller, her publisher, Random House, has 
flown her here on a VIP publicity trip. Her husband, producer Robert Bradford, 
who has transformed all but one of her novels into television miniseries, has 
jetted out to be by her side. Her personal publicist is on hand. And a press 
packet has been prepared, extolling her books' vital statistics: more than 30 
million copies sold in English-language editions and publication in 34 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
A household word in England, the British author of romance novels is also 
building her name -- and her fortune -- in the United States, where she has 
lived for more than 26 years. In an industry dominated by deep-pocketed 
corporations, Bradford is a guaranteed money-maker with whom publishers are 
making record-setting mega-deals. 
</P>
<P>
Her present book, "The Women in His Life," jumped into the No. 1 slot on 
British best-seller lists mere days behind the novel's June publication date. 
In a review of the book, the British newspaper the Evening Standard, noted, 
"While 'The Women in His Life' lacks the page-turning intensity of, for 
instance, 'A Woman of Substance,' the tightly knit plot is splendidly 
sustained." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing in bookstores last Thursday in the United States, the work is the 
first product of a $10-million three-book contract, engineered by literary 
agent Morton Janklow. Janklow, who represents such authors as Jackie Collins, 
Judith Krantz and Danielle Steele, named his take-it-or-leave-it price to the 
publishers -- "no negotiations," Bradford says. And that was for U.S. and 
Canadian rights only. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the world is mine," Bradford says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The author is sitting on the bungalow's peach brocade couch (her favorite 
color) in a room fresh with flowers. At 57, Bradford is a handsome woman, 
coiffed and dressed with impeccable English order. Living the world-scale 
glamour her novels portray ("I write about places I know"), she unabashedly 
loves clothes, fine antiques, handsome men and expensive hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Her style is chit-chatty (she has a small chipped tooth, a wonderful Romanian 
manicurist and plans to redecorate her kitchen and dining room next year) and 
alternately decisive, in the manner of Margaret Thatcher, whom she much 
admires. Her conversation is heavily referenced with the names of the rich and 
powerful: her friend Hannah Pakula, director Alan Pakula's wife, who wrote 
about Elena Ceausescu in Vanity Fair; Queen Elizabeth's cousin, Lord Lichfield, 
who took her portrait, bedecked in emeralds, for her new novel's dust jacket; 
publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch and his wife, Anna; Spanish singer Julio 
Iglesias and, last but not least, the loyal steed of her world travels, the 
Concorde. (It bore her home from London two years ago when her fluffy white 
bichon frise, Gemmy, became temporarily paralyzed.) 
</P>
<P>
She and and her husband have just returned from a vacation in St. 
Jean-Cap-Ferrat on France's Cote d'Azur, which followed a three-week 
promotional tour through Britain. Relaxed, Bradford is again ready to talk 
about "The Women in His Life." 
</P>
<P>
The set piece of the room's coffee table, the book shimmers in its red jacket, 
with the author's name in "lapis royal blue purple," as Bradford describes it. 
She set out to re-create the colors from the packaging and graphics of Giorgio 
Beverly Hills' perfume Red, she says. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I want it to be packaged like cosmetics,' I told (Random House publisher) 
Joni Evans. 'I want it to have that look that somebody wants to reach for it.' 
Packaging is so important in selling perfume." 
</P>
<P>
But the principal reason that her books sell well is, as she states, "that I'm 
a brand name. When a book comes out, they grab it." 
</P>
<P>
The story now up for grabs is a departure from her panoramic sagas centered on 
strong-willed women, which began with her blockbuster, "A Woman of Substance," 
published in 1979. In "The Women in His Life," Bradford tells the tale of 
Maximilian West as his life sweeps by those of his mother, his nanny, and a 
trio of wives. A beautiful billionaire corporate raider, West is "power 
personified," a man who dashes about a world staged with marble mansions, women 
ready for seduction and corporations ripe for takeover. In a "This Is Your 
Life" ending, West comes to his senses, pleading in a post-epiphanic cri de 
coeur, "No more champagne"; he takes brandy instead. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the book's subject matter accurately reflects the author's 
interests. "I think finance is fascinating," Bradford says. "That's why I made 
'Maxim' a tycoon. Business and money interest me. Not money in the sense of 
something to spend, but as a monetary unit, a tool of industry." 
</P>
<P>
Utilizing historical drama, the book's action progresses from Kristallnacht, 
the first of the Nazi pogroms, on Nov. 9, 1938, to the dismantling of the 
Berlin Wall 51 years later. At its most informative, the novel recounts 
resistance to Hitler in Germany's upper social ranks and West's (shortened from 
Westheim) childhood escape from the country, which is loosely based on 
Bradford's husband's experiences as a German Jew fleeing Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
A supporter of a strong Germany functioning within a European political 
framework, Bradford declares, "They've spent 45 years trying to expiate their 
crime. The Nazis only wanted power for the sake of having power; they didn't 
want it for economics. Germany is going to be the most dominant country in 
Europe, but not necessarily warlike." 
</P>
<P>
With the major exception of a nurturing nanny (Bradford's mother was a nanny 
before she married), the novel is less supportive of women, often depicting 
them as frivolous, (two New York working women are shown as egregious new-rich 
hustlers) and it assumes an ethical allegiance to the monied class. 
</P>
<P>
"The book has no message," Bradford says, adding: "It's a book people can read 
quite easily. I work very hard to make it easy to read, without descending into 
an infantile prose style." 
</P>
<P>
As for literature in general, she says, "You tell me someone who's writing 
literature today and I'll go buy the book." 
</P>
<P>
Examples are given. 
</P>
<P>
"But how many people read them?" she ask. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford's own desire to be a novelist began when she was a child growing up in 
Leeds, in the industrial north of England. The daughter of a machinery 
engineer, she says she was both spoiled and driven to make a success of 
herself. She sold her first short story at the age of 12 and later bypassed 
college to get on with a career as a journalist, working for a year as fashion 
editor of Woman's Own, a popular women's magazine, and interviewing celebrities 
for the large-circulation evening paper, the London Evening News. 
</P>
<P>
After her marriage, she moved to New York in 1964, and for 12 years wrote a 
syndicated newspaper column on interior design. Following four attempts at 
writing suspense novels, she turned to the saga, finding immediate success with 
"A Woman of Substance." In this best seller, Bradford's heroine, Emma Harte, 
rises from poverty in a small Yorkshire town to become the head of an 
international merchandising empire and one of the world's wealthiest women. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford resents press correlations of her frequently termed "rags-to-Vuitton" 
rise with that of Emma Harte. She says she "loathes" a profile published 
recently in the Sunday Times, which mentions "childhood deprivation" and 
describes her father as a "wooden-legged" former soldier. "His leg was made of 
aluminum," Bradford corrects, saying: "I come from an ordinary middle-class 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Like Harte, however, she admits she is a workhorse who starts at sunup and puts 
in 12-hour days in her office, which is decorated like a library, she says. Two 
walls of books contain such favorite novelists as Irwin Shaw and James Clavell, 
as well as Charles Dickens, the Bronte sisters and a biography of Winston 
Churchill. Her typing table is custom-made to blend with her Victorian desk; 
the walls are pale yellow, the carpet fir green, the sofa and ballon curtains 
done in flowered chintz, she says. 
</P>
<P>
She will be returning to their New York apartment ("47th floor overlooking the 
East River"), while her husband is off to Hong Kong to begin filming a TV 
miniseries of "To Be the Best," the last novel in the Harte trilogy. Before 
beginning her next book in the fall, Bradford plans to take the rest of the 
summer off. 
</P>
<P>
There will be time for lunch dates with pals such as Fran Weissler (Broadway 
producer with her husband, Barry, of "Gypsy" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," she 
notes) at restaurants such Le Cirque, the Russian Tea Room, and, she says after 
a second's consideration, "maybe some little place."

   Warplanes rumble overhead. Bombs whistle down and
explode, shaking the floor. Thick smoke wafts over the wreckage and
a woman's screams mingle with the reassuring tones of a Cockney air
raid warden.
   It's ``The Blitz Experience,'' a vivid museum display that gives
post-World War II generations a taste of London under German
bombardment.
   As those who lived through the 1940-42 bombing of London can
attest, ``The Blitz Experience'' is unnerving. The smoke smells
real, the ground really does shake, and the sounds are authentic
wartime recordings.
   ``The Blitz Experience,'' the centerpiece of the Imperial War
Museum's $31 million redevelopment, begins in a brick shelter like
those in which thousands of Britons cowered during air raids.
   For seven minutes, mostly in chilly darkness when the single
storm lantern is blown out, visitors listen to a raid launched in
the fall of 1940.
   ``If you lived in our street you'd have been in here, 12 hours a
night, night after night,'' says the recorded voice of George
Barker, a Cockney grocer who doubled as an air raid warden,
patrolling the streets in a tin hat, and who lost his shop to a bomb.
   There are moments of humor, in tribute to the legendary spirit of
the Londoners under siege, such as Barker remarking that a shop
whose front was blown up ``put out this big sign. Know what it says?
`More open than usual.'''
   Those on the recording sing ``Roll out the Barrel,'' breaking off
as a woman screams when a bomb explodes close by.
   When the all-clear siren sounds, Barker ushers everyone out,
saying: ``Let's see what Jerry's (the Germans) left us.''
   A man named Albert, who disdains the shelter and ``always sleeps
behind the bar,'' groans in the wreckage of his pub but is pulled
out alive.
   The London skyline is red with fire, an unexploded bomb lies
nearby, the firefighters are running out of water.
   ``Our house _ it ain't there,'' a woman says.
   A little boy hunts for his toys. His mother is heard coaxing him
away from the wreckage, promising him new toys.
   ``It's our job to make the terror, the horror and the sacrifice
as real to people who, we hope, will never experience it as those
who did,'' said the museum's director, Alan Borg.
   The Blitz, he said, has been mythologized by nostalgia. ``It
wasn't fun, and one of the aims of our experience is to show that it
must have been a terrifying thing to live through,'' he said.
   ``It's no good being serious and boring about it and saying
`you've got to listen to me!' I've got to get people in and say,
`this is interesting, come and see!' And then hopefully they'll
think about it.''
   Queen Elizabeth II, who served in the wartime Auxiliary
Territorial Service and whose Buckingham Palace home was bombed in
1940, will visit ``The Blitz Experience'' Thursday when she
officially opens the redeveloped museum.
   The museum arose from a government decision in March 1917 to
collect and display material from World War I.
   It is housed _ appropriately, some say _ in the building that was
the 19th century mental hospital known as Bedlam.
   Its extraordinary relics include caltrops, a sabotage instrument
with four spikes used by the ancient Romans and resurrected in World
War I to damage the feet of men and horses.
   Besides little tins labeled ``Queen Mary's Comforts for the
Troops'' from World War I _ needles and cotton, cigarettes and candy
_ there are guns and gas masks, tanks and two-man submarines,
uniforms and medals, fighter planes suspended from the ceiling,
100,000 books and the world's best war art collection of 12,000
paintings and drawings.
   Next year, it plans to open ``The Trench Experience,'' which will
expose visitors to the mud and smells of a World War I fighting
front.

CAROLINE HUNT'S SOURED INVESTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
WEALTH: ONE OF THE NATION'S RICHEST WOMEN HAS LOST A BUNDLE ON STOCK IN FIRST 
EXECUTIVE. NOW HER TRUST IS BIDDING FOR THE LOS ANGELES INSURANCE COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For much of her 66 years, Caroline Rose Hunt, one of the nation's wealthiest 
women, focused her attention on doing good works and raising five children. 
More often than not, she shunned the spotlight that was hers for the asking, 
merely by virtue of being one of the Hunt dynasty of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
It was only in the last decade, when she took an interest in the buying and 
promotion of luxury hotels -- including the Bel-Air Hotel in Los Angeles -- 
that her name began to appear not only in the society columns but also the 
business pages. 
</P>
<P>
Her name has again come to the fore recently with an offer by a unit of the 
Caroline Hunt Trust Estate to purchase controversial First Executive Corp., the 
Los Angeles-based life insurance concern best known for its huge junk bond 
holdings. The offer expired this week without a response from First Executive, 
but another offer is widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive's stock plunged last month after the company announced that it 
would take a $515-million charge against earnings to account for the declining 
value of its junk bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said the bid by the Caroline Trust, as it is known, is an effort 
to bolster public confidence in the struggling company. (One condition of the 
offer was that First Executive's chairman, Fred Carr, would have to resign from 
the company.) Rosewood Financial Inc., one of five corporations within the 
trust, owns almost 10% of First Executive's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
While Caroline Hunt's name is on the trust, executives within Rosewood and 
outside analysts portray her role in setting investment strategy as almost 
negligible. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not a part of making those decisions," said Charles Tusa, a senior vice 
president of Rosewood. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Zimmerman, who was in charge of the trust's hotel management branch 
for 10 years before leaving last year to form his own company, said, "She lets 
her companies run themselves with her people, including family members, in on 
the decision making." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Benteman of Wealth Monitors, a Kansas City, Mo., investment firm that 
tracks the portfolios of the nation's wealthiest people, said Hunt's style when 
it comes to the trust is to keep it at arm's distance. She is not even a member 
of the advisory board that runs it. Her presence is felt, though, by the fact 
that her children are involved in the trust's activities, particularly her 
oldest son, Stephen Sands. 
</P>
<P>
"She surrounds herself with good people," Benteman said. "They are the best 
that money can buy." 
</P>
<P>
But the trust may have "stubbed its toe" by investing so heavily in First 
Executive, Benteman said, and it now appeared to be trying to bail out the 
ailing company by making the purchase offer. (Rosewood originally invested 
about $103 million in First Executive stock, but at current prices the stake is 
worth only about $27.5 million.) 
</P>
<P>
On balance, though, it is difficult to argue with Caroline Hunt's policy of 
letting others manage her fortune, though the downturn in oil and Texas real 
estate is sure to have had a negative effect on the trust. 
</P>
<P>
She is regularly ranked as one of the wealthiest women in the nation. And while 
her brothers -- Nelson Bunker, William Herbert and Lamar -- retain only a 
fraction of what was one of the largest fortunes in the world before their 
adventures in attempting to corner the silver market a decade ago, Caroline 
Hunt remains a perennial entry on any list of America's richest people. Forbes 
magazine last year estimated her worth at $800 million, including the assets of 
the trust. 
</P>
<P>
The second daughter of famed wildcatter H. L. Hunt, she is known as the kind of 
woman who prunes her own trees, cooks her own dinner and enjoys finding a 
bargain when she is shopping for clothes. The author of a book of pumpkin 
recipes, she was once asked by the Dallas Morning News whom she most resembled. 
</P>
<P>
"People say Mary Martin. I say thank you," she replied. A graduate of Mary 
Baldwin College in Virginia, she married a Navy pilot, Lloyd Sands. While he 
was off in World War II, she worked first in her father's Dallas office, then 
as a sales clerk at the Neiman Marcus department store. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had five children before they divorced in 1973 and she married Buddy 
Schoellkopf, who came from a prominent Dallas family. They too were later 
divorced. 
</P>
<P>
The entry into the hotel business began in 1979, when her children bought a 
rundown mansion in Dallas and spent $20 million for a nine-story hotel building 
next to it. Today, the Mansion on Turtle Creek is considered one of Dallas' 
finest. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt had in the past left most of the dealings of the trust to others, but the 
hotel business seemed to attract her interest. The construction of the tony 
Remington Hotel in Houston, the purchase of the Bel-Air and the Hotel Hana-Maui 
in Hawaii followed over the next five years, as did the building of the 
Crescent Court Hotel near downtown Dallas. While the trust handled the 
purchases, Hunt lent her name to the projects as a representative of the trust. 
</P>
<P>
"Business activities and publicizing are two different things," said Tusa. 
"She's been a tremendous help in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the hotel investments of the trust have been pared back by more 
than half. Both the Bel-Air and the Hana-Maui hotels were sold last year for 
staggering profits, and the Remington was disposed of in 1985. There have been 
persistent rumors that the hotels were sold to give the trust a cash infusion 
because of losses in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the real estate market and oil, you have to put that together," 
said Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Life Styles of the Rich and Famous:
Christmas Books: A Holiday Sampler

   The rich are richer than you or me. 
They aren't afraid of looking ostentatious either. 
As unabashed as Marie Antoinette, they let the readers of Town and Country eat lavish slices of their opulent lives in Palm Beach. 
This year, you could read about the very newly arrived and preposterously luxurious life of the designer Carolyne Roehm in the New York Times, New York Magazine and other centers of modern morality without ever coming across the phrase nouveau riche. 
So let's not be stuffy this Yule. 
Let's push our noses against the aquarium glass and watch the big resplendent fish of this and other days glide through their gilded halls, unblushing, acquisitive, "sportif," fur-lined and fun. 
You don't even have to leave your own undistinguished, unphotographable living room to do it. 
Just buy one of these books, or, better yet, give them to friends you want to put politely in their place. 

   ---
   Even if they have a yacht, its unlikely theirs will be as nice as the boats in Jill Bobrow and Dana Jinkins's "The World's Most Extraordinary Yachts" (Norton, 221 pages, $50). 
My favorite is "Nabila," a "self-sufficient island" that belongs to the Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi. 
At 281 feet in length, it isn't quite as big as Queen Elizabeth's Britannia (412 feet), but it has a few features Her Majesty might envy, including a small screening room with 1,500 films and cashmere blankets to snuggle under. 
Mr. Khashoggi can choose from among 280 telephones to conduct business while afloat, and if he should tire of haggling about, say, the price of missile launchers on the international market, he can slope off to the blue suede and gold lame pillows of Nabila's discotheque. 
Not just for show, however, the ship has a crew of 50, its own operating room, and earned a bit of its keep as a set for the James Bond film "Never Say Never Again." 

   ---
   For the landlubbers in your set, the odds-on favorite is "The Majestic World of Arabian Horses" (Abrams, 213 pages, $60) by William L. Pereira Jr., photographs by Martin H. Schreiber. 
Though it comes from a publisher known for art books, this is not just a collection of pretty pictures of graceful descendants of the Godolphin Arabian (1724-1753), pictured here in a posthumous painting done by George Stubbs in 1792. 
The most romantic of all horse breeds is beautiful, but it also has a history. 
After mythic beginnings in Araby, the tale moves to Europe and in particular to Poland, yes Poland, where Czar Alexander I established a stud in 1817 at Janow Podlaski. 
Polish Arabians snorted futile defiance at the advancing Nazi hordes in 1939, as Polish cavalry mounts. 
The stud survived the war much depleted, but it has rebounded and now supplies stock to capitalist fanciers at one of the world's great horseflesh auctions, well attended by rich Americans and conducted in English. 
Hard cash only, no zlotys accepted. 

   ---
   Rich people also like to spend time inside at the table. 
And they can afford to have other people polish their silver collections. 
At least one cannot imagine that the Baron and Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza have the time to look after all the extraordinary pieces that are scattered about the rooms of their Villa Favorita in Lugano, Switzerland, or at Daylesford House in Gloucestershire, England. 
Normally, these intricately sculptural cups and tankards and plates are not shown to the visiting public. 
And most of us will not see them on exhibit next fall in the U.S.S.R. 
So "European Silver: The Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection" (Vendome, 311 pages, $95) by Hannelore Mueller is the place to look if you want to see how a table setting really ought to be. 
Perhaps the greatest of the Thyssen treasures is a rococo traveling service of 53 gilded silver items made in Augsburg around 1750. 
More humble in its fabulous way is a 17th-century "tortoise flask," also from Augsburg. 
A flat silver bottle is the tortoise's body; its shell is the natural shell of a Greek tortoise. 
The learned author remarks accurately on the "alert appearance of the animal with its watchful eyes." 

   ---
   Splendid as this and the rest of the Thyssen holdings are, no collection formed as recently as theirs with a mere German heavy industrial fortune can match the treasures contained in the Topkapi Saray Museum in Istanbul. 
There, in the former palace enclosure of the Ottoman Empire, the ruling sultans amassed everything from rugs to scimitars for six centuries. 
The first two of a projected five volumes have now appeared: "The Topkapi Saray Museum: Costume, Embroideries and other Textiles" and "Manuscripts" (New York Graphic Society, 216 and 280 pages, $150 each volume), translated, expanded and edited by J.M. Rogers of the British Museum from original Turkish texts by various hands. 

   Sumptuous as objects themselves, these books will introduce most Americans to an unsuspected universe of high accomplishment and delicacy. 
In the textile volume, the embroidered court kaftans in a dozen styles have been photographed flat and unoccupied, making excellent color abstractions on the page. 
The Topkapi library has been legendary in Europe since the Renaissance. 
Its illustrated manuscripts come not only from the Near East but from China, and other cultures exotic even in Istanbul. 
The richness of the classical Ottoman manuscript pictures rivals those from India and Medieval Europe. 
They are realistic to the point where the painting of Selim II receiving a bowing ambassador in 1567 (painted in 1581) can bring the now uninhabited rooms of the Topkapi to life for the modern visitor. 

   Future volumes will explore jewelry and metalwork, carpets (Persian and Turkish) and architecture (the harem and other palace buildings). 
But given the price of these books, it might be cheaper to go to the Topkapi itself and wander among the exhibitions, stopping at the parapets to look over the Golden Horn and pretend to be a sultan in the full exercise of unimaginable power. 

   ---
   Not as grand as the Ottomans, but perhaps luckier in the long run, Henriette and Peter Clifford of Frampton Court, Gloucestershire, discovered 300 Victorian flower paintings in their attic in 1982. 
Evidently dismissed as routine amateur work by the Clifford sisters and aunts who made them, they were in fact gorgeous, rare and botanically interesting folk art. 
Collected as "The Frampton Flora" (Prentice Hall, 192 pages, $25) by the British nature writer Richard Mabey, the paintings survey plants in the immediate vicinity of the Clifford house, the Vale of Berkeley, from winsome, leaning yellow common fleabane to a wild raspberry in all stages of development at once, from white flower to heavy hanging red fruit, and with roots exposed. 
The Mabey text is an expert commentary on the science and offers easygoing social and family history as well. 

   The Cliffords epitomize the virtues of the mid-19th-century English countryside. 
They were anything but flashy. 
Their paintings were stitched up in scrapbooks and stowed in the attic almost as soon as they were made, according to Mr. Mabey, who is judging from the remarkable brightness of the colors of the originals. 
The reproductions seem to be more subdued, but they are still most charming, and it is easy to see how this facsimile edition turned into a best seller in England. 

   ---
   For a pure draught of a completely different, hyperurban, very smart life style, try "The Complete Lyrics of Lorenz Hart" (Knopf, 317 pages, $40,), edited by Dorothy Hart and Robert Kimball. 
Mr. Hart was the poet laureate of the Broadway musical in the greatest era of Broadway theater, which reached its commercial zenith in 1926. 
His words and Richard Rodgers's music expressed the spirit of the top drawer in Manhattan, the college-educated cleverness that could take pleasure in the internal rhyming of "Caring too much is such/A juvenile fancy" or the joyfully mixed metaphor of "If my heart gets in your hair, You mustn't kick it around." 

   Hart's sister-in-law and Mr. Kimball, the musical-theater historian who previously devoted himself to Cole Porter, have dredged up all the Hart lyrics that industry could locate. 
They believe many songs are still missing. 
Perhaps this is not a full-blown tragedy, since many in this book are less than galvanic, especially without music to go with them. 
Song lyrics go best with songs, but this is still a bracing gust of the cleaner air of a pristine Manhattan, down whose streets Fred Astaire danced without fear in a spotless tuxedo. 
The nostalgic will also be happy to have the pictures of the Hart shows, including one of Gene Kelly surrounded by showgirls in the original "Pal Joey" of 1940 or another of Dennis King, Vera Zorina, Vivienne Segal and Walter Slezak in "I Married an Angel" (1938). 

   Hart understood all about the surface of wealth, what it could do and what it wasn't. 
In the most glittering language, he serenaded the simple life. 
In the heart of the Depression, he produced "The Lady is a Tramp" (1937). 
"Social circles spin too fast for me," he wrote, "My Hobohemia is the place to be." 
It is the real American note, slick but not phoney: "I go to opera and stay wide awake" or "I go to Coney -- the beach is divine." 
He knew about "life style" before they invented the word. 
But in the end, with all the style a person could hope for, he put the emphasis on the life half: "No dough -- Heigh ho!"

<P>
ALEXANDRA, WHO WILL VISIT ORANGE COUNTY THIS WEEK, IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S MOST 
POPULAR AND ACCESSIBLE ROYALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When she was a child, she liked to turn cartwheels and be called Sandra, and 
her ambition was to be a circus bareback rider. 
</P>
<P>
She did become an accomplished horsewoman, but these days you don't call her 
anything but "your Royal Highness." Because Alexandra Helen Olga Christabel, 
Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra, Hon. Lady Ogilvy, GCVO, has a richer 
royal pedigree than the Queen of England. 
</P>
<P>
When Princess Alexandra arrives in Southern California this week to lend the 
British Royal Family's presence to the Festival of Britain in Orange County, 
residents will get a look at not only the Queen's first -- and favorite -- 
first cousin, but a descendant of King George V, King Edward VII, Queen 
Victoria, King George I of Greece, King Christian IX of Denmark and Czar 
Alexander II of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Though she is unknown to most Americans, Princess Alexandra is considered in 
Britain to be one of the most popular and accessible of the royals. She is just 
outside the orbit of the queen's immediate family, but throughout her adult 
life she has taken on the role of what has come to be known as "professional 
princess," representing Britain and the Royal Family at official engagements at 
home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
She wears the royal mantle lightly, however. 
</P>
<P>
She is "easily one of the most popular of the royals, a woman of unstuffy charm 
and classic beauty, regal in presence but highly accessible," author Ralph G. 
Martin wrote in his book "Charles and Diana." 
</P>
<P>
"When she was Diana's age," Martin wrote, "she was also known as a marvelous 
dancer, a gay conversationalist who loved to laugh, adored children, had a 
craving for sweets and was a ballet addict. Her favorite jazz piece was 'Ain't 
Misbehavin'.' " 
</P>
<P>
However, in her professional role, "she's got an enormous interest in whatever 
she's doing," said Sir Eldon Griffiths, a member of Parliament who lives part 
time in Orange County, lectures at UC Irvine and is the president of the county 
office of the World Affairs Council. "That's the main thing that comes across. 
She does her homework and she's very well briefed. She, in fact, goes at it 
very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's Festival of Britain visit will be the first time she has traveled 
to the county, but her brother, the Duke of Kent, and his wife were made 
honorary citizens during a 1985 visit to dedicate a Laguna Hills housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The princess visited Los Angeles in 1971 in a promotion of British men's wear 
and will return there briefly Oct. 15 and 16 briefly after her Orange County 
visit. Among other things, she will meet with Mayor Tom Bradley, visit Union 
Avenue Elementary School and observe a program for mothers of children born 
with a crack addiction at County Harbor/UCLA Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Mona Mitchell, the princess' private secretary, said from London that Alexandra 
was "delighted" by her last visit to Southern California and "thoroughly enjoys 
travel," although her schedule while on tour is always tightly controlled. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of schedule has become meat and potatoes for most members of the 
Royal Family, said John Houlton, a British vice consul based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They take their profession quite seriously," he said. "We think the princess 
in a sense serves in an ambassadorial role. She's a figurehead that people are 
interested in meeting." 
</P>
<P>
And it is interesting that in a country of people whose ancestors absolutely 
hated King George III, modern British royals are often received with the sort 
of adulation usually reserved for rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
"In California," Griffiths said, "royalty is a rarity, and its scarcity value 
gives it a much higher profile. There's a curiosity that is much more acute 
here than in Britain." 
</P>
<P>
Mere curiosity, however, does not fully explain the liquid looks that members 
of the British Royal family see turned on them when they come here. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it intriguing too, I have to say, that people in the U.S. -- and in 
France too, which is also a republic -- are so intrigued," Houlton said. "I 
think that part of it is that the Royal Family are very much a national symbol 
of something that has endured for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It has an air of majesty and romance to it. They're a symbol of permanence in 
a rather impermanent world these days. I think that's appealing even to 
countries that have no wish to have a monarchy of their own." 
</P>
<P>
Princess Alexandra has felt the glare of celebrity almost all her life. 
</P>
<P>
Born on Christmas Day, 1936 (her fourth name commemorates her birthday), 
Alexandra is one of three children, and the only daughter, of Prince George and 
Princess Marina, Duke and Duchess of Kent. Her birth, said her grandmother, 
Queen Mary, was "the only nice thing to have happened this year" -- the year of 
the abdication of Edward VIII. 
</P>
<P>
She can trace her paternal lineage to Queen Victoria and, on her mother's side, 
to Czar Alexander II of Russia (Queen Elizabeth is descended from royalty only 
on her father's side). 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's father, the son of King George V and Queen Mary, died in 1942 in a 
plane crash on his way to tour Royal Air Force bases in Iceland during World 
War II. The princess was raised at Coppins, her family's country home in the 
Buckinghamshire village of Iver, by her mother, who was a daughter of Prince 
Nicholas of Greece and his wife, the former Grand Duchess Helen of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
Although Alexandra's mother was known as one of the most stylish and glamorous 
royals of her day, she enrolled her daughter as a student at Heathfield, an 
exclusive English girls' boarding school -- making Alexandra the first British 
princess to attend a regular school. 
</P>
<P>
She continued her formal education in the winter of 1953-54, when she attended 
a finishing school in Paris. When she returned to England, she took a nursing 
course at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children in London, where 
she was known simply as Nurse Kent. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1950s, Alexandra had begun to take on more official royal duties, 
but she had also come to be known as an eligible young princess and began to be 
seen more in London social circles. 
</P>
<P>
Confrey Phillips, a English-born pianist who performs regularly at the Westin 
South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa and once played in London hotels and 
nightclubs, remembered that during that time Alexandra was "a very likable 
lady. At that time she was first sort of stepping out. She liked to be with 
friends and have a nice social evening somewhere privately. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had my nightclub in Mayfair (The Colony on Berkeley Square) she'd come 
along with her friends and a couple of times with her husband-to-be, although 
that hadn't been announced at the time. She liked dancing and loved music." 
</P>
<P>
She apparently loved Phillips' music, because Phillips said he and his trio 
were hired to play at Buckingham Palace for the princess' 21st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"There were about 200 people there," Phillips said, "and it was a great 
success, a great party. There was continuous dancing." 
</P>
<P>
The dancing kept up, Phillips said, even when his band took a break. A group of 
Princess Alexandra's friends who were amateur musicians acted as a relief band. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not at all aloof," he said. "She's very relaxed and always has a lovely 
smile and a wonderful soft disposition about her. She's not wet and frumpish, 
like some of these aristocrats can be. She's the least forbidding person you 
could meet." 
</P>
<P>
During the time she knew Phillips, Alexandra also became acquainted with a 
young commoner named Angus Ogilvy. Born in 1928, Ogilvy was the younger son of 
the Earl of Airlie and grandson of Mabell, Countess of Airlie, who was a close 
friend and lady-in-waiting to Alexandra's grandmother, Queen Mary. After an 
eight-year friendship, the princess and Ogilvy were married in Westminster 
Abbey on April 24, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy, by his choice, was not catapulted into the aristocratic stratosphere by 
his marriage. When the Queen offered him an earldom (a common practice when a 
princess marries someone of lesser rank), Ogilvy refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why I should get a peerage just because I married a princess," he 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Queen did confer a knighthood on Ogilvy in 1989, making him a 
Knight Commander in the Royal Victorian Order. 
</P>
<P>
A businessman who is on the boards of directors of several British companies, 
Ogilvy accompanies the princess on many of her trips abroad (he will come with 
her to Orange County) and is properly addressed as Sir Angus. 
</P>
<P>
The Ogilvys have two children, James Robert Bruce, born in 1964 and married to 
Julia Rawlinson, and Marina Victoria Alexandra, born in 1966 and married to 
Paul Mowatt. Neither are titled and are not considered to be royal. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy once underscored the somewhat hybrid nature of his immediate family by 
referring to its members as "mini-royals." 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra's many tours, duties and appearances entitle her to receive money 
from the Civil List, which is an allowance given to members of the Royal Family 
by Parliament to help pay for staff and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the public wrongly assumes that all royals are rich," Martin wrote. 
"Princess Alexandra . . . had no money of her own. Neither did Angus Ogilvy, 
since his older brother inherited both the family title and the family 
fortune." 
</P>
<P>
Griffiths said he believes that the Princess was the first member of the Royal 
Family to drive herself routinely and to ride the Underground rather than be 
chauffeured. (In fact, in 1962, she crashed her Austin Mini into a truck on 
London's Kensington High Street. She later admitted that she had been driving a 
bit too fast.) 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra does have an extensive collection of jewels that have come to her 
through her royal relatives. But the woman wearing the gems, so firmly rooted 
in royal tradition, apparently has little use for any pretense that might be 
attached to them. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the sometimes-stifling pomp associated with royal appearances, 
she has shown a sense of good-humored proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget," she said of the Royal Family in the 1960s, "that nowadays we 
have to compete with Elizabeth Taylor and the Beatles."

<HEAD>Poll Says 82 Percent Of Britons Support Monarchy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four out of five Britons remain firmly royalist but
nearly 60 percent think Queen Elizabeth II should step down to allow
her eldest son Prince Charles to become king, according to an
opinion poll published today.
   The Gallup poll, published in The Daily Telegraph newspaper,
reported 82 percent of those questioned said they were in favor of
the British monarchy, just 14 percent wanted it abolished and the
rest expressed no opinion.
   But 59 percent said they thought the 62-year-old queen should
``retire'' early, allowing 40-year-old Charles to become king.
   Because of the disgrace surrounding the abdication in 1936 of the
queen's uncle King Edward VIII, later the Duke of Windsor, in order
to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, the queen has said she
will never abdicate the throne.
   This could mean a long wait for Charles. His
great-great-grandfather, King Edward VII, had to wait until he was
59 years old before he succeeded to the thone in 1901 on the death
of his mother, Queen Victoria, at age 81.
   Charles, whose concern for the poor, homeless and what he regards
as the uglier aspects of modern architecture have won him widespread
public support, heads the list of most popular royals, according to
the poll. It said 21 percent of those questioned said Charles was
their favorite.
   A 75-minute television documentary made by the prince attacking
many modern buildings as ugly was screened by the British
Broadcasting Corp. on Oct. 28. A newspaper survey at the time said
75 percent of Britons agreed with him.
   In today's poll, 19 percent of respondents said Elizabeth the
Queen Mother, Charles' 88-year-old grandmother, was their favorite;
17 percent favored his 38-year-old sister Princess Anne; 12 percent
liked his 27-year-old wife Princess Diana best; and 11 percent liked
the queen most.
   Despite the overwhelming support for the monarchy, 40 percent of
presondents said they thought the $9.45 million in taxpayers' money
paid last year to support the royals was too much.
   The queen, one of the world's richest people, has a personal
fortune estimated earlier this year by the London business
publication Money Magazine at $6 billion. But she and some other
royals also receive an annual grant of taxpayers' money voted by
Parliament to help them with the cost of their official duties,
upkeep of palaces and other expenses.
   Asked whether they themselves would want to be members of the
royal family, 89 percent of those questioned in the poll said no.
   The poll was based on interviews with 918 people around Britain.
It stated no margin of error.

FT  01 SEP 93 / Britain's rich see their lives as firmly middle class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEALTHY go shopping at Sainsbury, believe themselves to be excluded from
a London or university based upper-class establishment and claim that most
important decisions are taken by men in the family.
The results of a survey of 70 of Britain's richest families published
yesterday at the British Association annual meeting show that many rich
people perceive themselves to be just like everybody else.
Leicester University, which published the findings, interviewed with
Midlands families deriving fortunes from new and old money. The families,
from landed gentry to captains of industry and commerce, each had at least
Pounds 250,000 in liquid assets. Several were worth tens of millions of
pounds.
Professor John Scott, in charge of the project, said that most of those
interviewed believed themselves to be middle class whatever the size of
their fortune.
Many claimed their biggest extravagance was their weekly Sainsbury's
shopping bill or going out for a meal. This was in spite of the fact that
they might own a yacht, jet aircraft or private stables.
Many complained they were excluded from an upper class establishment 'either
because it was London based or because entry depended upon a university
education', said Prof Scott.
Women were less content than men. Only five of the 70 families had women
heading their business activities; in the others, almost all key decisions
were taken by men.
Yet many women had played an important role in founding family fortunes
either through their work or by providing the initial capital. One woman
told the study: 'It was his dream, my money.'
Businessmen, in spite of their natural desire to hand down their wealth,
displayed a surprising lack of concern about passing on their companies to
their children.
Many took the view that the next generation had the right to pursue its own
path and that their businesses might do better under the control of
non-family members, said Prof Scott.
As a result, many owners planned to sell their businesses when they retired
although landed families were determined to keep their estates intact.

   An Indian Lawyer and His Ruby as Big as the Ritz

   Bangalore, India -- The Guinness Book of Records has its
loonies, its freaks of nature and its 5,500-pound hamburgers.
But it also has gemsreal gems, huge gems-and that list is the
most glittering in the book. There's the giant Star of Africa
diamond, Queen Elizabeth's crown jewel, sunk in a high-tech
vault in the Tower of London. And there's a 136-pound
flawless crystal ball on display at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C.
   The two largest star rubies in the world, according to the
Guinness Book, are the Rajaratna and the Indumathi from
India. One of the largest double star sapphires is the
Neelanjali. For years -- possibly centuries -- these three
stones, and a smaller fourth stone, were disguised beneath a
covering of black soot. Then, in 1983, an aging lawyer named
G. Vidyaraj found the black lumps in his parents' house,
attempted to give them away and then, mildly curious, took an
old toothbrush to them. Overnight, he became the owner of one
of the most stupendous gem collections in the world.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The value of these gems is impossible to estimate," says
Mr. Vidyaraj, a tall, lumbering and, these days, ailing man.
"Literally, they're priceless. Some people say I am the
richest person in the world."
   It's one of those amazing fairy tales that seems only
possible in India -- the homeland of Queen Elizabeth's
Kohinoor, another crown jewel -- but one with a bittersweet
ending. Seven years after his find, Mr. Vidyaraj has his
rubies, his sapphire and his three entries in the Guinness
Book. Otherwise, he's gotten nothing. He's reluctant to sell
the gems, wondering if anyone can afford such treasures. He
and his wife live on a stipend sent by his engineer son, who
lives in Washington, D.C. He's bitter that his own country
has shown no interest in the collection. And he constantly
worries about robbers and kidnappers. Threats come through
the mail and by phone; the local police are frequently
dispatched to guard his modest, first-floor rental apartment
in this southern Indian city.
   Mr. Vidyaraj is a distinguished man, with precise,
lawyerly speech, an impeccable double-breasted suit and
starchy, white hair. He is a direct descendant of the
Vijayanagara kings, who controlled much of south India from
the 14th to 16th centuries. History recalls the strongest
king, Krishna Deva Raya (1509-30), as an early advocate of
free trade. He imported velvets and damasks from Aden and
China, horses from Arabia, elephants from Ceylon, gold,
silver -- and precious gems. Presumably, this solves the
essential mystery of Mr. Vidyaraj's gems: They were court
jewels, or the spoils of the Vijayanagara era, which someone
protectively blackened against invasion or plunder. How,
when? Mr. Vidyaraj doesn't have a clue. All he knows is that
his parents inherited the four black lumps, which they kept
in the family "puja", or offering, room. They considered them
sacred, not invaluable.
   "I remember my father worshipping them," says Mr.
Vidyaraj, "and singing songs in praise of Shiva {a major
Hindu god}." His parents died in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1982
he cleaned out the family house and brought the sacred stones
to his cramped apartment here, storing them in a cupboard.
The next year he and his wife tried to donate them to a
temple, but the donation got caught in India's infamous red
tape. Driving home from the temple, he examined the black
lumps for the first time. He wondered aloud whether they
might contain gold. His wife, Indumathi, reacted with horror.
She said it would be sacrilege to melt them down and insisted
they be donated to another temple as soon as possible.
   But Mr. Vidyaraj had different plans. One day, he
dispatched his wife, daughter and the family chauffeur to the
movies. He brought the lumps to the kitchen and went at one
of them with a soapy toothbrush. "Until then I thought it was
metal," he says. "I held it against the light. I saw specks
of red." Underneath the soot was a star ruby weighing 2,805
carats. The second lump was a double star ruby weighing 1,125
carats. The third was a double star sapphire of 2,470 carats
and the fourth lump, though not Guinness Book material, was a
ruby of 650 carats.
   The lawyer-turned-gem-owner took a crash course in
gemology and hauled the stones to a succession of local
jewelers for cleaning and cutting. He was security conscious
from the start, using different cutters for different stones
and never revealing the full extent of his find. He went
public with the smallest ruby, the Vidyaraj, named for
himself, in 1984. The Indumathi, which was named after his
wife, was revealed a few months later. In 1987 he displayed
the big ruby, the Rajaratna, which after cutting, weighed
2,475 carats, and then the sapphire. He had them certified
and made the Guinness Book, which he considers his highest
achievement, or, as he puts it, "this height of eminence. If
I was in another country I'd probably be honored."
   Mr. Vidyaraj has hidden the gems in bank vaults and won't
even disclose if they remain in India. No one is allowed near
them, including journalists. The gems, which are uninsured,
are cut in cabochon shape, producing convex round stones
that, to a layman, lack the visual appeal of the glittering,
faceted gems in jewelry shops. "To an untrained eye, they are
rough stones not meaning anything," says Mr. Vidyaraj. "But
they can't be faceted: These are not ordinary articles of
commerce. For a person well-versed in gemology they are
geological wonders because of their size." Gem experts say
the value of the stones depends largely on their color and
their purity, which need to be assessed. Mr. Vidyaraj
believes they are worth a fortune easily exceeding $500
million. "The person who wants to buy them would have to be
the richest person in the world," he says. "I am just an
ordinary person, maybe below ordinary, out of fashion. And
yet, if my collection is valued . . ."
   Why hasn't Mr. Vidyaraj tried to sell the stones? Because
he's terrified of a "web of intrigue." His wife is a content,
pious woman, he says, totally uninterested in money. He and
his family have lived in the same one-bedroom apartment for
decades. His rent: $5.80 per month. His son supports the
couple and pays Mr. Vidyaraj's medical bills. (Last year, he
almost died of complications from diabetes.) He's spent his
savings getting the gems cut and recognized by the outside
world.
   The government of India once considered issuing postage
stamps honoring Indians in the Guinness Book, but the plan
never came through. This disappointed Mr. Vidyaraj, who sees
his gems as a national treasure. He also considers himself
the top Indian in the Guinness Book. There are quite a few,
most of them holding records for such feats as the longest
after-dinner speech or consumption of the greatest quantity
of glass. "How much publicity does a guy get who grows the
longest fingernails?" Mr. Vidyaraj asks sarcastically
(apparently referring to Shridhar Chillal of Pune, who
stopped cutting his nails in 1952. The Guinness Book reports
that Mr. Chillal is having trouble sleeping with his
14.4-foot nails and is willing to clip and sell them to any
interested party).
   But Mr. Vidyaraj still talks big about his gems, peppering
his conversation with quotes from Shakespeare and Aldous
Huxley. "My intention is to donate this treasure to humanity.
In its humble way, it could help with the scourge of cancer,
AIDS or education. So large is my head, so big is my
thinking]"
   His is a strange and somewhat sad tale, but perhaps not as
unique as it sounds. The Guinness Book relates that the
largest natural intense fancy blue diamond was found in 1904.
It was exhibited in Paris in 1925 and then sold. The buyer
was an Indian maharajah. According to Guinness: "Its current
owners are unknown."

   Charity began at home for Wal-Mart stores
founder Sam Walton, who ended a four-year reign as Forbes
magazine's richest American by sharing his $9 billion fortune with
his four children.
   Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge, with an estimated net
worth of $5.2 billion, climbed into first place on Forbes' annual
list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people.
   The prototypical member of Forbes' ultra-rich was a 63-year-old
male with 3.1 children working on his 1.4th marriage with a net
worth of $672 million last year, more than the gross national
product of Lesotho, Forbes said.
   The compilation contains 346 men and 54 women. Of those, 159
inherited their wealth. Eight states lack a resident on the list.
   Among alma mater represented, Yale educated 22 of the richest,
Harvard 17 and the University of Pennsylvania 12; the 45 with
master's degrees in business had an average net worth of $895
million, while the 10 high-school dropouts had an average of $854
million.
   Overall, Forbes' richest are worth an estimated total of about
$269 billion, up nearly $50 billion from last year, a 22 percent
increase that substantially outpaced last year's 4.4 percent
inflation rate.
   That total wealth would come just short of bailing out te
nation's failed savings and loans over the next 30 years, the cost
of which was estimated by Congress at $285 billion.
   The list, released Monday, appears in the Oct. 23 issue of
Forbes and is based on estimated holdings as of Sept. 8.
   At the pinnacle is Kluge, 75, of Charlottesville, Va., whose
holdings rose an estimated $2 billion from the previous year thanks
to a tripling in the value of his investment in cellular
telephones, Forbes said.
   Kluge moved up from the No. 2 spot. The magazine noted that
``klug'' in German means smart.
   Walton, 71, of Bentonville, Ark., who milked cows during the
Depression to support his family, split his Wal-Mart and other
assets equally with his four children. While the family's total
holdings increased from $6.7 bilion, the individual family members
tied for 20th on the list, each at $1.8 billion.
   Moving up to second from 12th place is investor Warren Buffett,
59, of Omaha, Neb., the head of Berkshire Hathaway, whose stock
market-based fortune nearly doubled, to $4.2 billion. Behind him is
Sumner M. Redstone, head of moviehouse operator National Amusements
Inc. and TV-cable giant Viacom, with $2.88 billion.
   The number of billionaires increased to 66 from 51. The minimum
net worth to make the list rose to $275 million from $225 million.
   America has more billionaires than any other nation _ Japan is
second with 41 _ but the richest of the world's rich are foreigners.
   Kluge's fortune makes him the ninth-wealthiest private
individual in the world, according to Forbes. He is topped by six
Japanese, a South Korean and Canadian publisher Kenneth Roy
Thompson. Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who made his money in land,
railroads and resorts, is worth about $15 billion, making him the
richest, Forbes said.
   Eighteen new billionaires joined the Forbes American list,
including Laurence and Robert Tisch of Loews Corp. at $1.36 billion
apiece, entertainment mogul Kirk Kerkorian at $1.29 billion,
indicted junk bond financier Michael Milken at $1.27 billion and
Trans World Airlines Inc. boss Carl Icahn at $1.2 billion.
   Donald Trump also is among the individual standouts, adding $700
million to his empire of hotels, casinos and an airline for a $1.7
billion total.
   For the second straight year, the youngest self-made billionaire
is 33-year-old William Gates III at $1.25 billion. Gates dropped
out of Harvard to found Microsoft, a computer software company, in
1972.
   St. Louis beer and baseball magnate August Anheuser Busch Jr.,
who died Sept. 29 at age 90, is included on the list with $1.5
billion. Forbes said it compiled its profiles before he died.
   The youngest person on the list is Caroline Marie Getty, 32,
daughter of the late George Getty, with her $330 million
inheritance. The oldest remained 94-year-old Mansfield Freeman of
Greensboro, Vt., whose $360 million worth includes a stake in
insurer American International Group.
   Among the losers were real estate investor and builder Fred
Trammell Crow, whose net worth, Forbes estimated, sank to $300
million from $775 million, thanks to softness in commercial real
estate. Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione slipped into something
less comfortable and dropped off the list.
   About 20 percent, or 82, of those listed live in or near New
York City; Los Angeles is second with 32 and San Francisco third at
19. Twenty-one people on the list own at least one-third of a major
league sports franchise.
   Publisher Malcolm Forbes included his own biographical data and
outside reported estimates of his net worth but refused, as usual,
to divulge his wealth. Forbes' sketch was included in the under
$500 million category. ``I'm solvent,'' he said.

UTRILLO'S MOTHER BY SARAH BAYLIS (RUTGERS PRESS: $19.95; 246 PP.)

"I've always been a liar -- it runs in my family," begins Sarah Baylis' 
brilliant and biting novel, "Utrillo's Mother." Capturing our attention and 
imagination while failing speculation as to the veracity of her story, Baylis 
recounts in a series of flashbacks a fictionalized biography of 
Marie-Clementine (Suzanne) Valadon (1865/7-1938). 
</P>
<P>
The mother of Utrillo, she was a talented post-Impressionist artist in a period 
when the art world was experiencing tremendous growth and upheaval, though it 
remained almost exclusively a male domain. 
</P>
<P>
Baylis writes about art and politics, women and sex, oppression, freedom, 
self-expression and social stigma from an ardently feminist perspective. Her 
vision is frank and refreshing, sparing neither the sacred cows of 
Impressionism nor our preconceptions of their world as portrayed in their 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Baylis' protagonist is brash. She acts without regret or apology. She sells 
herself time and again, yet survives on her own terms. We may blush at her 
audacious conduct but admire her courage and conviction. Her desire to paint, 
to draw, to be an artist overwhelms all else. She sleeps with artists to learn 
their technique, models for others to steal tubes of paint or drawing pads. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is multidimensional. Political and social events helped to inspire 
the new art and bring on the rejection of the standards of the Academie des 
Beaux Arts. Turn-of-the-century artists were caught up in the spirit of 
revolution which led them to strike out in new directions and experiment with 
new ideas: Impressionism, Pointillism, Symbolism. Much of the descriptive 
narrative involves the events of the revolution of 1860, the Paris Commune, the 
Prussian War, the turn-of-the-century Parisian cafe society. Baylis gives us 
characters which bring to life the period: the beautiful baker's daughter who 
paints slogans, the lesbian waitress who introduces Valadon to the seedy 
underground. Baylis' descriptions are luscious and earthy, giving us not only 
sights and sounds but the odors and the emotional fervor of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
This historical context is equally important in establishing the role of women, 
and thus the basis for Valadon's outrage at the injustice she suffers. Baylis 
gives a brutal description of the lives of the working-class women of the time 
-- their backbreaking menial work, their constant fear of starvation and 
poverty, the very hopelessness of their plight. 
</P>
<P>
It is with this reference point that Baylis critiques so strongly Watteau, 
Fragonard, Renoir and other artists in their rose-tinted portrayals of 
shepherdesses and washerwomen: "Washerwomen were the rage. . . . Contemptible 
in real life, they were now almost respectable in fine art . . . but where 
slavery exists in a civilized society it must be quickly romanticized, or else 
there will be complaints, petitions, fuss and bother . . . and we'll all be 
waiting until domesday for our collars and cuffs. The same painted tradition 
that had transformed the shepherdess from a dung-smeared illiterate into a 
beribboned picnicker changed the lowly washerwoman from a tippler to a giggling 
cutie." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, on another level, the novel is atemporal. Valadon's feelings are too real, 
too natural: We identify too easily with her fantasies and with her struggle. 
Questions of sexual politics, of woman's role in society -- these are questions 
that are valid today in our society. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins with Valadon as an old woman, looking back on her childhood on 
a farm where she lived with her mother, Madeleine. Her mother is called 
Madeleine throughout the book, possibly indicating the tense and angry nature 
of the mother/daughter relationship: "We were tied together by poverty and 
kinship, hating both and loathing each other, eaten up by love and guilt." 
</P>
<P>
The farm is described in detail, a dark and dirty place seen through the eyes 
of an unhappy child. In one episode, there is an encounter with a Gypsy, and we 
see immediately the scene through the eyes of the artist: "I wish I could have 
painted her like that -- I would have made her green brown, then outlined her 
hands with a strong black line and all the colours of her clothes would be rich 
and sombre against the turbulent grass." 
</P>
<P>
Having revolted against her insulting and obnoxious employer, Madeleine is 
forced to leave, and with child in tow, heads for the city, hoping to improve 
her lot. Their lot does not improve. Madeleine finds another menial job and 
sends Valadon off to a convent school: "The place reeked of suppressed sex and 
the girls were infected by it. We were the most obscene creatures; pornography 
was scrawled on the toilet walls and swear words, picked up from our brothers 
and fathers were the cornerstone of our language -- alongside that 
cannibalistic butcherspeak that religious people use." 
</P>
<P>
After the convent, Valadon holds a series of jobs -- in a hat factory, then in 
a restaurant where she becomes a waitress and a pickpocket: "I loved thieving, 
it was my chief satisfaction. They had so much it wouldn't be missed. They were 
rich old cows in fancy hats and fox furs, who despised me. They deserved to be 
inconvenienced." 
</P>
<P>
After the restaurant, a vegetable stand, then, taking a 50-year-old clown as 
her lover, a job with the circus. It is at the circus that she meets Theo, her 
first artist, and she becomes involved with him and his world, learning from 
his work and eventually becoming a model. She models for Renoir and Chavannes, 
all the while drawing and painting furiously on her own. The transition from 
model to artist of some renown is gradual. She meets Degas, whom she considers 
brilliant: "He was called a misogynist, too. If a painter portrays a woman as 
she is, that painter will be called a misogynist, a hater of women. 
</P>
<P>
For to portray women with truthfulness is to suggest that you accept them as 
they are, and that is the most dangerous thing you can do in the world. Just 
think of it! If women are ever accepted as they are -- exhausted, possessed, 
angry and bartered . . . then the world will have to change in every single 
particle." Valadon ignores the critics and continues her art but is finally 
betrayed by her femininity -- she gets pregnant and the son she bears marks 
forever her destiny: "Never encourage your son to pick up a brush and dabble 
with painting, within a few months they'll say he has outstripped you . . . 
they'll do anything to hold a woman back, even use her poor drunken son to 
betray her. . . . Christ, it's hurtful this endless punishment of being mother 
to a painter." There are more liaisons -- a banker, a painter, and eventually 
some fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Although today she is recognized as a gifted artist, a modern reference book 
refers to Valadon's work as "violent." If this be the case, certainly Baylis 
has created a biography that would explain the violent nature of her work. More 
important, Baylis' rich prose brings to life a vibrant and impassioned 
character -- a character whose ideas are as truthful and vital in 1989 as they 
were 100 years ago.

   Capt. Rob Hertberg jinks his F-16D
tactical fighter into a series of wrenching turns, levels off and
streaks over his target at 525 m.p.h.
   ``Boom! We got it,'' Hertberg, 29, tells his backseat passenger,
seconds after snapping the 15-ton U.S. Air Force fighter into a
steep, banking climb away from the target.
   Hertberg, under agreement with the Air Force, took an Associated
Press reporter on board for a look at the type of low-level
training mission that has become extremely controversial in West
Germany.
   As the jet rolls out of a hard 90-degree turn, Hertberg quickly
brings it down low over the village-flecked plains and bogs of
northern West Germany.
   Back in formation, Hertberg and his wingman, Capt. Keith Sage,
skim over treetops at an altitude of 500 feet and at speeds

   ``I will use my name,'' His Grace
said. ``I will use it ruthlessly.''
   His name is Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the sixth Duke of
Westminster and reputedly Britain's richest man, and he said he'll
lend it to a good cause.
   The 37-year-old aristocrat was standing on what he considered to
be a good cause _ the site of an industrial estate. He's doing his
bit to help the local development corporation attract American
investors.
   ``If you are given a lot, I think you should give a lot back,''
said the duke, who spends about one-third of his time supporting
150 charities.
   He says it springs from a sense of duty: ``We still have a lot
to do with those who have been left behind in the march toward
prosperity.''
   It's also a sort of insurance against those British radicals who
would regard the duke as a child of archaic privilege. In these
egalitarian times, it's important for aristocrats, from royalty
downward, to be seen working for the common good.
   But he is no apologist for the aristocracy.
   ``There is a class system wherever you go in the world. We just
have handles on our names to identify our pecking order better.''
   In the pecking order he is also the Marquess of Westminster,
Earl Grosvenor, Viscount Belgrave, Baron Grosvenor and 15th Baronet
of Eaton.
   The boyish, energetic duke is tall, medium-built, and for his
outing to Warrington he wore a conservative suit and the British
aristocracy's obligatory gold pinky ring. His basset-hound eyes are
very blue. His eyebrows meet at the bridge of his nose.
   Laughing in frequent short bursts, he is casual and friendly,
obviously well-practiced at putting the overawed at ease with
one-liners.
   He speaks with an updated version of the upper-class British
accent, laced with occasional Americanisms, like ``you guys.''
   The Grosvenor family fortune is estimated by London's Sunday
Times to be worth $5 billion, surpassed only by Queen Elizabeth
II's $8.7 billion.
   It owns 300 acres of London's elegant Mayfair and Belgravia
districts, including the plot on which the U.S. Embassy stands.
   Back in 1677, it was all cabbage patch and swamp, the dowry of
Mary Davies, the 12-year-old bride of Sir Thomas Grosvenor.
   The estate also owns pieces of Scotland, Vancouver in British
Columbia and Hawaii, a sheep station near Wagga Wagga, Australia,
and extensive property outside Chester in northwest England, where
stands the family home, Eaton Hall.
   ``It's not something I wake up every morning with and say, `How
wonderful to have all this money,''' the duke said. ``I am not
sitting there on hard cash and it's not going into cars and boats
as I see fit.''
   Does he ever feel guilty about being born so rich?
   ``No, never have done and never will do,'' he said.
   ``I am a curator of what my family does now and of what my
family have done in the past and I am a planner of what my family
will do in the future.
   ``I use my wealth in order to create. My wealth is a business
and it is a very substantial employer of people.''
   A major drawback, he said, is having ``too little time to see
one's family. I clearly resent that.'' But he added, ``It comes
with the territory.''
   Born in 1951, he was the second of three children. The other two
were girls.
   He was reared in Northern Ireland, where his father was a member
of Parliament and ran a silversmith's business. He has described
his childhood as idyllic, isolated and free.
   A series of accidents of birth and death brought the title to
his father in 1967, and at 16, young Grosvenor was suddenly heir to
one of the world's biggest fortunes.
   At exclusive Harrow school he was an undistinguished student,
and instead of college he roughed it as a cowboy on a British
Columbia ranch, learned farm management in New Zealand, and worked
for a real estate agent and a nature conservancy agency in Britain.
   When he was 21, his father became ill and Grosvenor began to
learn the complexities of the family business.
   In 1978, he married 19-year-old Natalia Phillips, or ``Tally,''
whose great-grandfather was Grand Duke Michael of Russia.
Fittingly, they met at a ball.
   At 27, on his father's death, Grosvenor succeeded to the title.
He has two daughters and no son, so the heir to the estate is his
cousin, the Earl of Wilton.
   ``Clearly my regret is that my father went when I was very
young,'' he says. ``I had to cocoon myself at a very early age.''
   He had dreamed of an army career, and found it hard to adjust to
his responsibilities.
   He reached a compromise. During the week he is the businessman
commuting to London by helicopter. On weekends, he dons camouflage
and joins maneuvers as a major in Britain's territorial army, or
volunteer reserve force.
   The duke has tried to modernize, restructure and expand the
estate, which builds and manages shopping centers, industrial sites
and office buildings. It has extensive property interests in the
United States.
   ``My goodness, we weren't quite on the quill pens when I took
over but we weren't far from it,'' he said.
   The duke says he has another ambition: not to be the Grosvenor
who loses the family fortune. He says he's happy to pay income tax,
but his accountants spend a lot of time figuring out how to avoid
inheritance taxes.
   Some of his tenants complain that his rents are exorbitant, and
he has been tagged ``Lord Greedy Guts.'' He is unapologetic.
   ``I operate on the simple principle of supply and demand. I am
not running a charity ... for some of the richest people in the
world,'' he said. ``Someone can go and live somewhere else if they
want to. I have a waiting list from here to Washington.''
   The duke describes himself as a liberal Whig and his aides
advise the uninitiated to address him as ``Your Grace.''
   The first duke was Hugh Lupus, a Master of the Horse, who was
awarded the title in 1874 for philanthropic works. The first
recorded Hugh Lupus was William the Conqueror's huntsman whose
contribution at the Battle of Hastings won him Chester as a gift.
   The duke's treasure-filled family home is a 12-bedroom modern
glass and white tile structure his father built in 1973 to replace
a Victorian palace that was demolished.
   In his spare time, Grosvenor enjoys hunting deer and grouse. He
likes scuba diving, too: ``It's rather peaceful at the bottom of
the sea.''
   It's less peaceful on the Warrington site. News cameras click,
questions are asked. Then the duke shakes a few hands, hops behind
the wheel of his dark blue Jaguar, and sweeps off.
   With two honks and a wave.

PROBING THE MYSTERY THAT IS JACKIE;

<P>
Through the window of C. David Heymann's 14th-floor apartment on Central Park 
West, the tender green leaves of spring sag under the weight of a heavy rain. 
On the other side of the park's verdant expanse, on fashionable Fifth Avenue, 
lives a woman named Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis likes it or not, C. David Heymann is the man 
whose name is being linked these days with that of the Most Famous Woman in the 
World. 
</P>
<P>
Heymann is the author of one of the spring's hottest books, "A Woman Named 
Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, $21.95), a sizzling 631-page unauthorized biography of 
the former First Lady, who will turn 60 in July. 
</P>
<P>
Magazines, newspapers and television have been tripping over one another in a 
rush to get the book's most titillating tidbits into print. It has been a 
veritable Jackie bonanza, a tabloid-lover's dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie and J.F.K. shot up with amphetamines by a "Dr. Feelgood." . . . A 
lovesick Marilyn phones Jackie at the White House. . . . Womanizing J.F.K. beds 
just about anything that moves. . . . Jackie's coldness makes Onassis want a 
divorce. . . . Jackie goes on shop-till-you-drop binges. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And true to her very private form, Jackie, through her spokeswoman Nancy 
Tuckerman, has had a discreet "no comment" on this latest tell-all tome. 
</P>
<P>
Why our endless fascination with a woman whom Heymann, after four years of 
research and interviews with 825 sources, still calls "a mystery, a 
hieroglyphic, a question mark"? 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie, probably because she's never spoken in her own behalf, has remained a 
subject of tremendous interest to Americans and to people all over the world," 
says Heymann, 44, who hit the best-seller lists a few years ago with "Poor 
Little Rich Girl," a biography of Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
If Jackie has maintained a regal silence, plenty of people -- from the late 
Christina Onassis to the public relations director of Maxim's -- talked to 
Heymann and his crew of researchers. And while Heymann refused to quote anyone 
anonymously, three of his main sources -- Christina Onassis, Peter Lawford and 
Truman Capote -- are dead. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the wonders of this century is that we have a tape recorder, and 
they're on tape," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Files Helped 
</P>
<P>
And thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, Heymann made extensive use of 
CIA, FBI, Secret Service and the White House social files. The Secret Service 
files chart President Kennedy's insatiable appetite for women, and Heymann's 
account of the White House years reads like "Fanny Hill." 
</P>
<P>
"I think John F. Kennedy, in retrospect, is a disgrace," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
If Kennedy and the image of Camelot emerge tattered and tarnished, Aristotle 
Onassis comes out smelling like a comparative rose. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he made some genuine efforts to have a fulfilling marriage. He grew 
close at least to John Jr.," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
Heymann claims to have only respect for the way Jackie Onassis has dealt with 
adversity and tragedy in her life and for her courage in returning to work late 
in life as a book editor. 
</P>
<P>
"She's regal; she's elegant as ever; she is an everlasting mystery," he says. 
"I think she's elevated the human spirit in this country. If there were more 
Jackie Kennedys around, this would be a better place in which to live. I find 
her to be a very noble person." 
</P>
<P>
Readers are likely to come away from "A Woman Named Jackie" with mixed emotions 
-- moved by her devastation at the loss of John F. Kennedy, put off by her 
apparent coldness and determination to live in the lap of luxury. 
</P>
<P>
"She's human. She does have frailties, and money is her Achilles' heel," 
Heymann says. "But compare her to the Duchess of Windsor, for example, who put 
herself before England. The poor guy (Edward VIII) had to step off the throne. 
Here's a woman who, despite her husband's carrying on, put the country before 
herself and supported John F. Kennedy, who lent herself to making the White 
House a splendid place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woman of Many Faces 
</P>
<P>
Although Heymann insists that his portrait of Jackie is positive, his book 
unflinchingly quotes those who see her variously as avaricious, as icy, as less 
intelligent than she has been purported to be. 
</P>
<P>
Readers learn that Christina Onassis loathed the glamorous woman who married 
her wealthy father. They read that Jackie glared icily at JFK when he and Angie 
Dickinson slipped away for an apparent tryst on Inauguration Night. They are 
told that Jackie was drinking heavily when she recounted the horrors of her 
husband's assassination to author William Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
Are there limits to what the public has a right -- or even a desire -- to know? 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are interested in people," Heymann says. "We're all animals on 
this Earth. We're all at the same watering hole and we look at each other. 
That's basically what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Heymann began his writing career as a poet and literary biographer. "Ezra 
Pound" and "American Aristocracy: The Lives and Times of James Russell, Amy and 
Robert Lowell" were nominated for Pulitzer Prizes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why the Tabloid Books? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I couldn't continue to write literary biography and support a 
family. I don't mean to suggest I write just for money, but a person does have 
to make a living," Heymann says in explaining why he has moved on to books like 
"A Woman Named Jackie" and "Poor Little Rich Girl." 
</P>
<P>
The Barbara Hutton biography, originally published by Random House in 1983, was 
recalled, according to Heymann, because of an error about the date of birth of 
a Hutton physician, which left open the possibility of a lawsuit. The physician 
was charged with overmedicating the heiress. Random House would not republish 
the book; Lyle Stuart then picked up the rights, and the book went on to become 
a best seller and a TV miniseries. Heymann says that the incident does not 
impugn his integrity or credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Heymann daunted by his own admission at the end of 631 pages that the 
real Jackie remains elusive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the book is about in a sense; it's a search for the real Jackie 
Kennedy. This is a woman who is simply unknowable, who probably doesn't even 
know herself," Heymann says. 
</P>
<P>
But with bookstore orders upping the in-print total of "A Woman Named Jackie" 
to 450,000 copies just a week after publication, it is clear that inquiring 
minds will take what they can get.

  [Text] Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held at 
the Grand People's Study House in Pyongyang on June 20 to 
introduce the book "Korea I Saw Again 40 Years After" written by 
Cuban woman lawyer Candelaria Rodriguez. 
  In his speech at the meeting, Kim Chin-pom, vice-chairman of 
the Committee for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries, 
said that Cuban woman lawyer, the author of the book "Korea I 
saw Again 40 Years After", impressively wrote what she saw, 
heard and felt during her revisit to Korea 40 years after she 
visited Korea as a member of an international fact-finding team 
during the fatherland liberation war (June 1950- July 1953) and 
exposed to the world people the bestial atrocities committed by 
the U.S. imperialist aggressors against the Korean people. 
  He expressed the hope that this book would help the 
revolutionary people of the world to have a clearer 
understanding of the validity and invincible vitality of the 
socialist cause for its rich, truthful and revolutionary 
contents and for its diversified, concise and vivid method of 
expression. 
  Candelaria Rodriguez, the author of the book, spoke next. 
  Noting why she wrote the book, she said: 
  "I have come to write this book in order to inform the world 
people, even a little, of the true looks of Korea which rose 
like a phoenix from heaps of rubbles and has completely changed 
its appearance startling the world people under the wise 
guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  In his speech, Han Pong-chan, deputy director general of the 
Foreign Press Group, noted that the book in Spanish was 
translated and published in French, Chinese, English and Russian 
and disseminated among foreigners. This book, he added, will 
greatly encourage not only the Korean people in their tireless 
efforts to defend and further glorify the Korean-style socialism 
centred on the masses but also the revolutionary people of the 
world in their righteous struggle.

<HL> Trump Sniffs at Plaza Bid, Leaving a Sultan Sulking </HL>

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Donald Trump bought the Plaza Hotel for roughly $400 million this year, the judgment of many real estate observers was that he paid too much. 

   Industry sources, however, say Mr. Trump already has received -- and rejected -- an offer for the Plaza that would have net him a 50% profit. 

   The sultan of Brunei, reputedly the world's richest person, recently offered to buy it for a little more than $500 million. 
When Mr. Trump declined, the sultan upped his bid to roughly $600 million, the sources say. 
But Mr. Trump said no deal. 

   The sultan apparently didn't get wind that the Plaza had been on the market before Mr. Trump, who bought it from the Robert M. Bass Group, had more or less locked it up. 
"It was the one hotel he wanted to own more than any in the world," a source said of the sultan. 

   Mr. Trump declined to sell because he likes owning the famed, landmark hotel and wants to make good on his vow to make it the world's best, sources say. 
Mr. Trump declined to comment. 

   The ruler of Brunei, a tiny Asian nation on the oil-rich island of Borneo, has a fortune estimated at $25 billion, and lives in a 1,788-room palace. 

   Last year, the sultan bought the Beverly Hills Hotel from oil and entertainment tycoon Marvin Davis, reportedly for more than $200 million -- just months after Mr. Davis purchased it from one-time stock speculator Ivan Boesky for roughly $135 million.

A young woman threw a T-shirt at Queen Elizabeth II today and radicals 
campaigning for Maori rights heckled the British monarch during anniversary 
celebrations for the founding of modern New Zealand.

The queen, who was accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, appeared shaken, 
witnesses said.
