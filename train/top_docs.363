<HEAD>Soldiers, Peasants Clash in Northwest Haiti</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers and peasants clashed in
the hamlet of Danti in northwest Haiti with a rural law officer
reported killed and many peasants wounded, radio stations in the
capital said Tuesday.
   The report coincided with a plea by Foreign Minister Gerard
LaTortue on Tuesday for international aid for this impoverished
Caribbean nation. He told a news conference at Puerto Rico's
Department of State, ``No democratic process can sustain itself if
it is not accompanied by economic development.''
   The United States suspended most of its aid to Haiti following
election violence last November.
   Section chief Leroy Ely was killed in Danti last Thursday,
touching off the clashes which reportedly continued until Monday.
   Section chiefs in Haiti are rural police officers with military
rank, responsible for supervising public works as well as
maintaining law and order. Under the 29-year Duvalier family
dictatorship, section chiefs exercised wide powers.
   Ely traveled to Danti to impose the authority of the capital
city of the section, Le Borgne. Peasants demanded their hamlet be
assigned to neighboring Gros Morne district and in subsequent
rioting, Ely was killed.
   Soldiers came to quell the unrest. Radio Lumiere, Radio
Metropole and Radio Haiti Inter reported that from Thursday to
Monday, Danti residents were beaten and arrested or forced to flee.
Their homes were pillaged and burned.
   Witnesses interviewed by Radio Metropole said many people were
wounded or forced to take flight. Radio Haiti Inter said 25
peasants were arrested.
   According to Radio Metropole, Danti is in a relatively fertile
zone and Le Borgne authorities did not want to lose it.
   Disputes over land have become common and violent in this arid,
mountainous and overpopulated nation that shares the island of
Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.
   Last July, hundreds of peasants clashed with landowners and
among themselves over property in the northwest village of Jean
Rabel. Dozens were killed.
   In asking for foreign help, LaTortue said in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, that ``For us Haitians, economic development means ... food
and water for the great majority of the population, and health
services, education and housing.''
   The United States has been Haiti's biggest foreign aid donor,
contributing $103 million a year to the poorest nation in the
Western Hemisphere, with a population of 5.3 million.
   Most U.S. aid was suspended following cancellation of last
November's national elections because of violence, which the
then-ruling junta under Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy did little to curtail.
   France and Canada maintained their aid commitments to Haiti, but
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have withheld
$40 million in loans.
   LaTortue, who spent 10 years in Puerto Rico as part of his
25-year exile during the Duvalier dictatorships, criticized U.S.
officials for blocking aid to Haiti following controversial
national elections last January.
   He asked Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth, to make available
scholarships for Haitian students and do what it could to promote
Haiti's economic development.
   Dictator Francois Duvalier ruled Haiti since 1957. His son,
Jean-Claude, took over at his death but fled Feb. 7, 1986 during a
popular uprising. A president, Leslie Manigat, was chosen in
January.

<TEXT>
THE US has not ruled out military intervention in Haiti to protect American
lives and restore democracy there, President Bill Clinton's ambassador to
the United Nations said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
Ms Madeleine Albright said Washington was monitoring the situation closely
and was standing by to evacuate some 1,000 Americans if necessary.
'The protection of American lives is foremost in our minds,' she said. 'We
don't rule anything in or anything out. This is a very tense situation, but
one in which we have to maintain calmness about our response.'
Reports from Port-au-Prince said hundreds of foreigners fled Haiti yesterday
after a night of heavy gunfire in some of the capital's neighbourhoods.
The country's international airport was jammed with American and Canadian
citizens who were urged to leave Haiti or take security precautions ahead of
stringent UN trade sanctions which come into effect at midnight tonight New
York time.
On Saturday the US embassy flew in 30 additional Marine guards and set up a
telephone network to alert American citizens about potential violence.
The Canadian embassy has urged all 2,300 of its citizens to leave the
country immediately.
US warships and three Canadian vessels, some visible from the capital city,
will make sure that no fuel or arms are allowed to enter Haiti. The UN
sanctions also include freezing the foreign bank accounts of army chief
General Raoul Cedras and other military leaders.
Ms Albright said the US was still hoping that Gen Cedras would step aside
and allow democratically-elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return
to power on October 30. Gen Cedras led the 1991 coup that ousted Mr
Aristide.
Gen Cedras refused to relinquish power on Friday, as had been scheduled
under a UN plan to return Mr Aristide to power.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, a former
military adviser for the Duvalier dictatorship, declared himself
president on Sunday after ousting Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Avril, adjutant general of the army, said in an early morning
address on national television that the Presidential Guard toppled
Namphy on Saturday because it was ``sickened'' by the way Namphy
governed. Namphy was sent to the neighboring Dominican Republic.
   Residents reported hearing heavy gunfire Saturday night near the
presidential palace in what appeared to be fighting between
military factions.
   Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, said soldiers
were killed, but Avril mentioned no casualties.
   Haiti radio stations reported that at least six people were
killed in the capital in coup-related clashes, and that mobs
pillaged two homes owned by Namphy and the home of Port-au-Prince
Mayor Franck Romain.
   The military government appealed in a national television
broadcast ``for calm, discipline and order in respect of individual
rights and liberties.''
   A witness told The Associated Press she saw two bodies in the
courtyard of Romain's luxurious house in the suburb of Delmas and
the property was occupied by soldiers.
   ``The house was stripped, doors were torn off the hinges. It was
a shell,'' the witness said.
   Avril took over a week after about 20 men armed with machetes,
handguns and steel pikes attacked the Roman Catholic Church during
a Mass being said by the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, a vocal
critic of the military government. Thirteen people were killed and
77 wounded. Opposition leaders blamed Namphy's government for the
attack and another church burning two days later.
   On Sunday morning, slum dwellers killed and burned the body of
one man and cheered when a soldier shot and killed another man
suspected of participating in the massacre. By midday, the city was
quiet, but the airport was closed.
   Avril, who was adviser to ousted President Jean-Claude Duvalier,
said Haiti will respect all international treaties, liberties and
human rights and said that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake
of national reconciliation.''
   Lubin said Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the 700-man Dessalines
Barracks, was named commander-in-chief of the army, but Avril did
not mention Paul. Dessalines is the most feared unit in the
7,000-man army.
   Paul, who has been indicted on federal drug trafficking charges
in Miami, had been considered the most powerful figure in Haiti
after Namphy. It was not known if Paul played a role in the coup,
but sources said Namphy and Paul were at odds.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said
noncommissioned officers of the Presidential Guard captured Namphy
in an apparently bloodless coup and persuaded Avril to take over.
   She said they were believed to be ``dissatisfied with recent
human rights violations and the general deterioration in the
security situation punctuated by attacks against the churches over
the past two weeks.''
   Ms. Stockman said Avril phoned the U.S. ambassador and said he
was assuming the presidency. She said the U.S. government still
wants Paul to answer the drug trafficking charges in court.
   Namphy arrived in a private plane at a private airport in Santo
Domingo, the Dominican capital, early Sunday morning, said Fabio
Herrera Cabral, deputy foreign minister of the Dominican Republic,
which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
   Namphy, in a military uniform, was accompanied by his wife and
daughter, Herrera Cabral said. They arrived with no luggage and
climbed into a waiting limousine, an airport employee said.
   They were taken to the Dominican Concorde Hotel, where former
President Leslie Manigat stayed after Namphy toppled him in a June
17 coup, Herrera Cabral said. It was not known if Namphy would
remain in the Dominican capital.
   Avril reported Namphy's ouster at about 2:30 a.m., several hours
after shooting broke out at the main plaza in front of the
presidential palace. The gunshots sent dozens of people fleeing for
cover.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the fighting
involved army factions and members of the Tonton Macoutes, the
dreaded agents that terrorized Haitians during the 29-year
dictatorships of the Duvalier family. Details were not known.
   In his speech to members of the Presidential Guard at the
palace, Avril declared himself president and promoted himself to
lieutenant general.
   ``The Presidential Guard, sickened by the way the country has
been governed since the seventh of February, 1988 ... has been
forced to act again,'' he said.
   Avril, a bespectacled, slim man of medium height, was dressed in
a military uniform. He was introduced as ``the most honest officer
in the armed forces'' by a sergeant who wore full battle gear.
   Avril has been a key behind-the-scenes figure in a succession of
governments since nationwide riots forced Duvalier to flee to exile
in France on Feb. 7, 1986. Duvalier had been president since the
1971 death of his father, Francois Duvalier, who ruled since 1957.
   Namphy led a military junta after Duvalier fled. Avril served as
an adviser to the junta, but resigned in early 1986 after
anti-government demonstrations demanded that he and other close
Duvalier associates resign.
   In March 1987, voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution
calling for elections under civilian control.
   Gunmen killed at least 34 voters on Election Day Nov. 29, and
the election was canceled. Soldiers from Paul's Dessalines Barracks
were blamed.
   Namphy scheduled new elections, but few people voted and Manigat
was elected on Jan. 17.
   Manigat became involved in a dispute with the military over the
transfers of Avril, Paul and other military leaders. Avril played a
key role in Namphy's June 17 overthrow of Manigat.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Former President Jimmy Carter spent
five hours in Haiti on a visit Friday in support of December
general elections here.
   ``The elections this year will be successful. They will be
honest and free and open, and also safe,'' Carter said in an
interview with the independent Radio Haiti-Inter.
   Elections are scheduled for Dec. 16. Carter was on his way to
Guyana, the South American country where preparations for elections
are also being made.
   He arrived by private plane at International Airport and was
welcomed by Foreign Affairs Minister Paul Christian Latortue.
Carter paid courtesy calls on President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot and
army chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herard Abraham.
   In the company of Electoral Council President Jean-Robert
Sabalat, Carter inspected voter-registration bureaus in the
capital.
   Carter said registration in rural areas was very good, but in
some parts of the capital ``not many people have registered yet.''
   This poor Caribbean island nation has 3 million potential
voters. In 1987, during the last attempt at free general elections,
75 percent of eligible voters registered. The election collapsed
when thugs supported by the army shot and hacked to death at least
34 voters. Hundreds were killed and wounded in pre-election
violence.
   The three-week voter-registration period began Oct. 5.
   Carter arrived at 9:30 a.m. and left for Guyana at 2:30 p.m.
   It was his third visit to Haiti since Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's
provisional government took power in March. He had visited Haiti in
October 1987.
   ``The army is giving full support to the election this time,''
Carter said.
   The president-elect will be sworn in on Feb. 7, 1991, on the
fifth anniversary of the overthrow of dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier.
   Elections will be monitored by the United Nations, the
Organization for American States, the Caribbean Community and
Carter Center observers. Carter said he would return himself in
December.
   He was accompanied on Friday by his wife Rosalynn and by Robert
Pastor, Latin American specialist at the Carter Center.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Officials in a small town clashed
with citizens demanding their ouster and a soldier guarding the
officials shot and killed one of the demonstrators, an independent
radio station reported Friday.
   Some Haitians said Thursday's confrontation in Desdunes, 150
miles north of the capital, was one of several indicating the
military government is clamping down on the reform movement
launched by a Sept. 17 soldiers' rebellion.
   In unrelated fighting about 50 miles south of Desdunes, two
people were killed Friday in a feud between members of two families
over land and hundreds of people fled their homes fearing a
massacre, according to Radio Haiti-Inter.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said the fight in Desdunes began after groups
representing youths, peasants and planters met to formulate demands
for disarming members of the Tonton Macoutes and repressive
government officials.
   The Tonton Macoutes were the private militia that supported the
29-year dictatorship of the Duvalier family.
   The demonstrators took to the streets intending to shut down
government offices, the broadcast said. Before they got to the
courthouse they were blocked by ``The Steamroller,'' a group of
henchmen and city officials led by Mayor Anthenor Mercius, the
radio said.
   The mayor's group, guarded by soldiers, threw rocks at the
protesters, and four soldiers protecting the demonstrators withdrew
to their barracks, the broadcast said.
   It said a soldier in the mayor's group, Sgt. Detroit Valco,
killed a youth identified as Evarol Racine and wounded another man
in the foot. Four other demonstrators were injured by rocks, the
radio said.
   Paul Latortue, an economist who ran for the region's Senate seat
in November's violently aborted national elections, said the town
is a stronghold of the Tonton Macoutes.
   Latortue noted that on Sunday, the government said it was
temporarily suspending the search for Tonton Macoutes. On
Wednesday, soldiers killed a squatter in the capital, and on
Thursday they dispersed a demonstration in the town of
Port-de-Paix, he said.
   The government believes ``the social potential of the soldiers'
reform movement is too high, it must be reduced and checked,''
Latortue said.
   The enlisted men of the Presidential Guard overthrew the
military government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a bloodless coup on
Sept. 17 and named Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to replace him.
   The soldiers demanded an improvement in living conditions for
themselves, the ouster of unpopular military and government
officials, and a return to the 1987 Constitution, which Namphy
suspended.
   In the initial reaction to the coup, people across the country
chased down, killed and burned several Tonton Macoutes.
   Latortue said Avril has consolidated his power and promoted
non-commissioned officers to bring them into line.
   ``Avril is successfully bringing off a vast seduction campaign
on behalf of American aid,'' Latortue said. ``But the fist in the
velvet glove is iron.''
   Radio-Metropole reported Friday that Haitian employees of the
U.S. Agency for International Development petitioned for immediate
resumption of U.S. assistance to Haiti.
   Two-thirds of the $90 million U.S. aid package was cut off last
year when November's elections were canceled. Thugs supported by
the army attacked and killed 34 people at the polls.
   Namphy took over after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to
exile in France in February 1986. Duvalier ruled after the 1971
death of his father, Francois Duvalier, who took over in 1957.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said its reporter in Estere, 100 miles north
of Port-au-Prince, said one person was was shot to death, another
was killed by machete blows and ``many people'' were clubbed or
stoned in fighting Friday in the fertile Artibonite Valley.
   It said the feud involves members of the Hatier and Bercourt
families who have had violent disputes for years over land
ownership.
   The report said that after a fatal shooting, Hatier property
near Estere was invaded by members of the Desdunes-based Bercourt
and in the fighting, hundreds of residents fled the area in panic.
   It said police made one arrest and called for reinforcements to
help restore calm.
   In July 1987, more than 250 people were killed near the town of
Jean Rabel in Artibonite province in battles involving a dispute
between an association of landless peasants and a coalition of
landowners and sharecroppers.

LT GEN Raoul Cedras, Haiti's army commander, yesterday ignored demands to
respect the United Nations-brokered plan allowing the country's exiled
president to return, despite the re-imposition of an international embargo,
AP reports from Port-au-Prince.
Six US and three Canadian navy ships were offshore to enforce the embargo
yesterday, and a French frigate was on the way to join them. Britain said it
would send a frigate.
Gen Cedras relaxed with aides at army headquarters early yesterday after the
midnight deadline for him to comply with the plan passed. News photographers
snapped shots of him smoking and joking.
Asked what the army would do if US troops came ashore to rescue Americans,
he said: 'I'm certain it will not reach such a point.'
The embargo aims to compel him to live up to an accord he signed to allow
exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to office on October 30.
Gen Cedras was a key part of the military coup which overthrew Mr Aristide -
Haiti's first popularly elected president - in 1991.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, came to life slowly on the first day of the
embargo. 'Gas supplies are normal. There's no rationing, yet,' a pump
attendant said. Prices remained stable at about Dollars 1.50 (Pounds 1) a
gallon and there were no queues.
But schools, government offices and some shops remained closed for a second
day on Mr Aristide's orders, to mourn the assassination last week of Mr Guy
Malary, the justice minister, who was part of the transition cabinet
preparing for Mr Aristide's return. Mr Robert Malval, the prime minister,
has blamed military authorities for the murder.
The sanctions decreed by the UN Security Council include a ban on oil and
petrol shipments, a ban on weapons, and a freezing of overseas assets of
Haiti's de facto authorities or 'their agents'.
While the blockade could stop tankers, the UN has taken no measures to halt
petrol shipments from the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of
Hispaniola with Haiti. The Dominican government is close to Haiti's army,
and previous cross-border embargo violations had been reported.
The Haitian military is also believed to have stockpiled several weeks'
supply of oil reserves.
The dispute has raised tensions in Port-au-Prince. Hundreds of residents
have fled to the countryside in anticipation of more army repression or a
foreign invasion.
Gen Cedras said the solution to the crisis lay in further negotiation, but
UN envoy Mr Dante Caputo, the architect of the plan to restore Mr Aristide,
rejected that idea.

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of foreigners living in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, gathered
at its international airport yesterday in an effort to flee the country
following the broadcast of a statement by supporters of the military
government that all white foreigners should leave immediately.
An attempt by the military government, through another broadcast yesterday,
to retract the command appeared only to have added to the growing panic and
tension.
Meanwhile, Haitians are leaving the capital for the countryside in the wake
of rumours that a foreign military invasion is imminent as part of
international efforts to restore Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president.
Clashes between factions supporting Mr Aristide and those backing the
military government, which has refused to step down, claimed 16 lives over
the weekend, and appeared likely to continue yesterday as Mr Aristide's
supporters organised three days of mourning for Mr Guy Malary, the justice
minister who was assassinated on Thursday.
Diplomats said Haitians were convinced that foreign troops would land in a
matter of days unless the military rulers left office and made way for Mr
Aristide to return.
The fears of an invasion heightened at the weekend as warships from the US
and Canada took up positions off Haiti's coast to enforce an international
economic embargo aimed at forcing Gen Raoul Cedras, the military leader, and
other officers to step down in accordance with an agreement reached with Mr
Aristide in early July. Gen Cedras and Lt Col Michel Francois, the police
chief, have said they will not leave office.
The effectiveness of earlier attempts at an embargo have been frustrated by
hectic trading across the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic,
which share the island of Hispaniola. The Dominican government has said it
will reinforce military patrols at the border, but businessmen in Santo
Domingo, the capital, said yesterday that this might not be enough to
prevent some soldiers and other smugglers from selling petrol and other
essentials to the Haitians.
Supporters of Mr Aristide say factions in the military have plotted the
murder of several prominent Haitians, including Aristide supporters and
members of the civilian government, to frustrate further the return of Mr
Aristide.
The claim gained currency following the murder last month of Mr Antoine
Izmery, a businessman and supporter of Mr Aristide, and that of Mr Malary
last week.
Likely targets of the campaign are reported to be Mr Robert Malval, the
prime minister, and Mr Evans Paul, the mayor of Port-au-Prince and a
supporter of Mr Aristide.

<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Haiti covers 10,700 square miles on the western third
of Hispaniola, a Caribbean island about the size of Maryland shared
with the Dominican Republic. Most of Haiti's land is mountainous
but eroded and treeless, allowing little more than subsistence
farming.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   THE PEOPLE _ Ninety-five percent of Haiti's 6 million people are
descendants of African slaves brought to the New World to cut sugar
cane. A slave revolt led by Francois Dominique Toussaint
L'Ouverture led to independence from France on Jan. 1, 1804, making
Haiti the first black republic in history. French is the official
language, although the majority of Haitians speak Creole.

   THE ECONOMY _ Haiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.
Life expectancy is 54 years, per capita annual income is $379 and
85 percent of the people live in poverty. Only 13 percent have
access to uncontaminated drinking water. Thousands, including about
15,000 abandoned or orphaned children, live and sleep in the
streets of the capital, Port-au-Prince, without shelter, sanitary
facilities or other necessities. A privileged class of about 60,000
controls nearly half the national wealth. Every five minutes a
Haitian child dies of malnutrition.

   HISTORY _ Haiti controlled all of Hispaniola from 1818 to 1839.
U.S. troops occupied the country from 1915 to 1934 after a long
period of instability. A post-World War II boom brought foreign
investment, tourism and public works, but little was done to help
the poor. Continuing political turmoil ended in 1957 with the
election of Francois Duvalier, a doctor who declared himself
president-for-life in 1964. ``Papa Doc'' died in 1971 and was
succeeded by his 19-year-old son, Jean-Claude. The Duvalier family
amassed an immense fortune and created the notorious Tonton
Macoutes, a private militia that throttled political opposition by
arresting, torturing and killing dissidents.
   Jean-Claude fled in February 1986 after food riots grew into
nationwide protests, and a military junta led by Duvalier's army
chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, took power. Namphy ruled
until civilian President Leslie Manigat, winner of
government-controlled elections, took office on Feb. 7, 1988.
Namphy overthrew Manigat in a bloodless military coup on June 17.
Namphy was ousted on Saturday. On Sunday, the commander of the
Presidential Guard, Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, a former Duvalier
adviser, declared himself president.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy today
declared himself president of Haiti after troops stormed the
national palace and deposed civilian President Leslie Manigat.
   ``The future of democracy and liberty was at stake. The army
must protect the superior interests of the country and must head
the country,'' Namphy said in a television broadcast late this
morning from the presidential palace.
   ``To this end, a military government has been formed with, as
president, Gen. Henri Namphy,'' he said.
   The coup ended four months of civilian government and put Namphy
back in command of the nation he led for two years as head of a
three-man junta. It came less than a week after Manigat fired
Namphy and tried to reorganize the military.
   Namphy was surrounded by military leaders, including Lt. Col.
Jean-Claude Paul, once Manigat's chief military ally. It was not
immediately known if Paul had aligned himself with Namphy.
   Manigat and his family arrived today in Santo Domingo, the
capital of neighboring Dominican Republic. Manigat was staying at
the Dominican Concorde Hotel, a hotel spokesman said. Haiti and the
Dominican Republic share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.
   ``The president betrayed your confidence and violated the
constitution he swore to observe,'' Namphy said. ``He took a path
that led irrevocably to the most brutal form of dictatorship. To
this end, he attacked the army and shook its high command to make
it a docile instrument of personal power. He thus imperiled the
conquest of Feb. 7.''
   A few hours later, the military announced a new Cabinet of
ministers. The announcement said the Senate and House of Deputies
had been dissolved and that the new government would rule by decree.
   The new Cabinet, announced on state-run television by Col. Gary
Leon, general secretary of the armed forces, was made up of 11
members of the military and one civilian.
   Manigat was inaugurated as president Feb. 7. The junta stepped
down after he took office.
   Manigat retired Namphy as commander in chief of Haiti's
7,000-man army on Friday, charging him with insubordination in
ordering the transfer of Paul and other high-ranking officers three
days earlier.
   Namphy first appeared on state-run television at about 1:30 a.m.
in a broadcast from the palace shortly after the coup.
   ``The army will lead the country this way,'' he declared, waving
an Uzi submachine gun and flanked by soldiers.
   There was no official word on casualties from the takeover.
   A man at Manigat's residence was on the telephone with the Miami
News when soldiers moved in. Jean Lescouflair identified himself as
director of the regional Information Ministry and a former Miami
teacher. He said Manigat was upstairs with government ministers
discussing how to respond to Namphy's statement when soldiers
arrived at about 3:08 a.m.
   ``I am hearing some noise coming like a machine gun,'' he said,
lowering his voice. ``They are entering the yard now ... It seems
like they are smashing the cars in the yard.''
   At 3:20 a.m. Lescouflair told the Miami News he could hear a
security guard shouting in French, ``Don't shoot! We're coming
out!''.
   A few minutes later, someone was heard yelling ``Hands up!'' in
French, the newspaper said. The last words from Lescouflair were,
``Call my wife. Goodbye.''
   Haitian journalists said troops loyal to Manigat were killed
when soldiers backed by three tanks freed Namphy from house arrest
and stormed the palace. Namphy had been held at his residence in
Bon Repos, 15 miles outside the capital.
   The front of the palace did not appear damaged and showed no
sign of battle.
   The airport was closed today. By midday, the streets of the
capital were busy with cars, trucks and pedestrians.
   Early today, radio stations were not broadcasting news, only
music, and international operators refused to accept calls. One
operator said Namphy ordered operators not to place calls, but it
was possible to dial directly.
   People on the streets were aware of what had happened, despite
the lack of radio reports.
   ``It's not good for democracy, what happened, but it may be good
for Haiti,'' said one 22-year-old unemployed laborer. ``Maybe we
cannot talk, but maybe we can work.''
   The fighting began after a 10-minute blackout at about 7:30 p.m.
Sunday. The streets of this Caribbean capital became deserted.
Automatic and heavy caliber gunfire broke out around the palace.
   Heard from a hotel two blocks away, it died down, then surged
for 1{ hours again just after midnight, when explosions also were
heard.
   Government sources said Manigat, 57, was taken by ambulance from
his home to a military hospital. A Haitian journalist said Manigat
would be expelled from the country.
   An Agence France-Press reporter spoke by telephone with Manigat
early today and reported the president said he was uninjured.
   Earlier Sunday, Manigat retired the Port-au-Prince police chef
and transferred about two dozen officers, including the head of the
presidential guard.
   ``The presidential guard went to get Namphy and brought him to
the palace,'' said the Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The army has controlled this impoverished nation during most of
its 184-year history. A junta ruled Haiti for two years after
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in February
1986.
   The military ran the Jan. 17 balloting in which Manigat was
elected. The most popular candidates and most voters boycotted the
election, and it was widely criticized as rigged.
   An independently run election Nov. 29 was thwarted by violence
that left more than 30 people dead.
   Paul's soldiers were blamed for much of the violence, after
which the United States withheld $60 million in aid. Paul was
indicted in March by a U.S. grand jury on drug trafficking charges.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US Navy frigate briefly stopped and boarded a ship from Belize bound for
Haiti yesterday in the first maritime interception since the reimposition of
a UN oil and weapons blockade on the Caribbean country aimed at restoring
its exiled president, agencies report from Port-au-Prince.
The ship's master reported he was carrying cement, an item not prohibited
under the embargo. The ship was allowed to proceed after an hour-long
inspection.
Six US and three Canadian navy ships are off the coast of Haiti to enforce
the embargo under Operation Support Democracy, and a French frigate is on
the way to join them. Britain and the Netherland said they would send
frigates, and Argentina is also considering sending vessels.
In Haiti, Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, the army commander, ignored demands to
respect the UN-brokered plan for the return of President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide.
Gen Cedras relaxed with aides at army headquarters early yesterday after the
midnight deadline for him to comply with the plan passed. News photographers
snapped shots of him smoking and joking.
Asked what the army would do if US troops came ashore to rescue Americans,
he said: 'I'm certain it will not reach such a point.'
The embargo aims to compel him to live up to an accord he signed to allow Mr
Aristide to return to office on October 30. Gen Cedras was a key part of the
military coup which overthrew Mr Aristide - Haiti's first popularly elected
president - in 1991.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, came to life slowly on the first day of the
embargo. 'Gas supplies are normal. There's no rationing, yet,' a pump
attendant said. Prices remained stable at about Dollars 1.50 (Pounds 1) a
gallon and there were no queues.
But schools, government offices and some shops remained closed for a second
day on Mr Aristide's orders, to mourn the assassination last week of Mr Guy
Malary, the justice minister, who was part of the transition cabinet
preparing for Mr Aristide's return.
The sanctions decreed by the UN Security Council include a ban on oil and
petrol shipments, a ban on weapons, and a freezing of overseas assets of
Haiti's de facto authorities or 'their agents'.

FT  30 SEP 93 / Haiti awaits Aristide's resurrection: Why the former
president may be back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM SPINDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE likelihood of the safe return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to
lead Haiti appears to have increased over the last week.
Violence and intimidation by supporters of the military leadership which
ousted the president two years ago last week looked likely to jeopardise the
implementation of an accord aimed at his safe return.
But the violence - at least in the capital, Port-au-Prince - appears to have
subsided and a weekend decision to boost the UN presence in the country has
raised hopes that Mr Aristide can return safely.
Around 600 US troops begin to arrive in Haiti next week in a
'non-confrontational' role as part of a 1,650-member UN mission in Haiti to
help in the restoration of democracy. The contingent is expected to contain
more than 500 police.
The agreement between military leaders and Mr Aristide envisaging the
latter's return, was sponsored by the UN and the governments of the US,
France, Canada and Venezuela and signed on July 3. The accord contemplated
the appointment of a new Prime Minister by Mr Aristide and his return on
October 30.
But since Mr Robert Malval took office as Prime Minister on September 2, he
and his cabinet have been obstructed and intimidated by government employees
appointed after the coup, who do not want to give up their posts. The
employees have been helped by bands of civilian police auxiliaries known as
'attaches' who have attacked government ministers and the mayor of
Port-au-Prince, Mr Evans Paul.
According to human rights groups, the 'attaches' are also responsible for
this month's violence against Aristide supporters, in which dozens of people
have been killed or have disappeared, including an important backer of the
President, Mr Antoine Izmery, who was pulled out of a church service and
shot dead.
The prosecutor in charge of investigating some of these killings, Mr Wilson
Ciceron, has resigned after receiving death threats. Ministers have been
subjected to intimidation which, in some cases, has prevented them going to
work. Mr Malval and his government cannot go anywhere without heavy police
protection.
The man whose job it is to provide it, the police chief, Lt Col Michel
Francois, has been accused by Mr Dante Caputo, special envoy of the
Organisation of American States and the United Nations, of being responsible
for Mr Izmery's murder.
Mr Malval's government has invited exiled Haitians to return to the country,
but there is no evidence that any of those returning are Aristide
supporters. Most appear to be supporters of the former Duvalier
dictatorship, which ruled the country for three decades.
In an apparent attempt to keep the activities of the Duvalier supporters
above board, Mr Malval has legalised a Duvalierist party.
In spite of the violence, Mr Aristide is adamant that he will return to
Port-au-Prince next month. He is planning to arrive with a number of
prominent international personalities, including the Nobel Peace Prize
winner Ms Rigoberta Menchu and possibly former US president Mr Jimmy Carter.
If he does, he will find mountains of refuse blocking the streets of the
capital, hunger and disease throughout the country, and an economy almost in
ruins. His first priority, nevertheless, will be to stay alive and to try to
stem the violence.
His task will not be helped by a new organisation calling itself the
'September 30 Group' after the date of the 1991 coup. It has been
distributing leaflets in the streets of Port-au-Prince threatening to
'eradicate' Aristide's activists before his return.
'The days to come must be red with blood' they warn. They also pledge to
intervene immediately whenever an employee appointed since the coup is
fired. 'Our democracy', the leaflet states, 'consists of the law and the
machine gun'.

US Marines will begin withdrawing from Haiti today, to be replaced by extra
US military police who are to help disarm forces loyal to Haiti's military
rulers, Defence Department officials said last night, report Canute James,
in Kingston, and agencies.
US troops are being ordered to stop violence between Haitians when they
safely can, but a senior US official said yesterday that this did not
indicate a broadening of US policy.
Also today, about 300 soldiers from seven Caribbean countries will be
deployed in Haiti - the first non-US troops to arrive since the military
intervention began a fortnight ago.
The new Caribbean troops, part of a multinational force which is to assist
imposing order in Haiti, have been training in Puerto Rico for three weeks.
They will be assigned to the docks in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital,
relieving US personnel.
The port area has been the scene of bloody clashes between factions
supporting the Haitian military and those backing the exiled President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Advocates of democratic reform expressed
hope that Haiti's new military leaders would open a dialogue with
the people after ousting Lt. Gen. Henry Namphy, who ran the country
for more than two years.
   Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, the army's chief administrative
officer, went on national television Sunday and declared himself
president of the Western hemisphere's most impoverished nation.
   He said Namphy was ousted by the 1,000-man Presidential Guard
Saturday night because it was ``sickened'' by his rule, which was
marked by a tolerance for the murder of government opponents.
   Avril was a military adviser to Jean-Claude Duvalier before the
dictator's February 1986 flight into exile and has since managed to
ally himself with the prevailing forces in the 7,000-man military.
   The government said an unspecified number of soldiers were
reported killed in the coup, and Namphy was sent to the Dominican
Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
   Port-au-Prince appeared calm Sunday night, though the U.S. and
Canadian embassies advised their citizens to stay off the streets.
Small groups of people milled in the streets and traffic was light.
Television and radio stations resumed their normal programming.
   The airport, which was closed Sunday, was expected to reopen
today.
   But for the four-month civilian presidency of Leslie Manigat,
which ended in June with a bloodless coup, Namphy had run Haiti
since Duvalier's departure, heading a military-led junta until
Manigat was elected in January in junta-run balloting that was
widely boycotted.
   On Nov. 29, independently run elections were thwarted by armed
thugs supported by the army who killed 34 people at the polls.
   And a week before the coup, about 20 men armed with machetes,
handguns and steel pikes attacked a Roman Catholic Church during a
Mass being celebrated by the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, a vocal
critic of the Namphy government. Thirteen people were killed and 77
wounded.
   Opposition leaders blamed the government for the attack and
another church burning two days later.
   Heavy gunfire was heard in the capital Saturday night shortly
before the coup, but Susan Clyde, spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy
here, said ``it appeared to be mainly celebratory shooting in the
air, nobody shooting at anyone or anything.''
   Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, said an
unspecified number of soldiers were killed.
   Radio stations reported that at least six people were killed in
the capital in coup-related clashes and that mobs pillaged two
homes owned by Namphy and the home of Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck
Romain.
   Although motives for the coup were unclear, it appeared the
soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the elite Presidential
Guard were disenchanted with Namphy's authoritarian rule.
   A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Presidential Guard had given the army's High Command a list of
19 demands for forming a new government, including democratic
reform and better living conditions for soldiers.
   All the demands were accepted, the diplomat said, except the
nomination of Col. Jean-Claude Paul as military commander-in-chief.
Paul has been indicted on federal drug-trafficking charges in
Florida.
   Paul, commander of the dreaded 700-man Dessaline unit, had been
regarded as the most powerful figure in Haiti after Namphy. It was
not known if Paul played a part in the coup, but sources said he
and Namphy were at odds.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said
the United States still wanted Paul extradited to face the drug
charges.
   Initial reaction to the coup from advocates of democratic reform
was positive, but cautious.
   ``I will support the military government if they say as soon as
possible when they will call elections,'' said Louis Dejoie II,
leader of the national Agricultural Industrial Party. ``We are
ready to speak with any government that respects human rights.''
   In his statement to the nation early Sunday, Avril said Haiti
will respect all international treaties, liberties and human rights
and that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake of national
reconciliation.''
   The statement was considered significant because it echoed a
recent offer for dialogue from opposition leader Marc Bazin, a
conservative leader of the Committee for Democratic Understanding.
   Bazin and Dejoie were among four leading candidates for
president in the Nov. 29 elections and boycotted the elections won
by Manigat.
   Dejoie said he expected the military to announce when elections
would be held in the next week or so.
   ``They must do it or they won't have any support,'' Dejoie said.
``The army right now has to regain its credibility. We want to give
them a chance with this new change of guard.''
   Avril has been a key behind-the-scenes figure in a succession of
governments since nationwide riots forced Duvalier to flee to
France. Duvalier had been president since the 1971 death of his
father, Francois Duvalier, who ruled since 1957.

FT  26 SEP 94 / US warns Haiti junta to co-operate after 10 die in clash
with marines
</HEADLINE>

US officers bluntly warned Haiti's military chiefs yesterday that they must
co-operate with the intervention force, after US marines killed 10 Haitians
in a fierce gun battle at a police station at the weekend.
President Bill Clinton, who will address the UN General Assembly today, said
he regretted the loss of life, but vowed US troops would continue to respond
to hostile action against them.
The outgoing Haitian strongman, General Raoul Cedras, was called,
grim-faced, to an airport meeting with the head of the US-led intervention
force, General Hugh Shelton, to discuss co-operation and flew by helicopter
to the site of the clash in the northern town of Cap Haitien. The US said
other officers would be meeting the Haitian military to 'ensure their
co-operation'.
The clash on Saturday night - the first involving US troops since they
landed a week ago - came after steadily rising tension between marines and
Haitian authorities in the town.
A US officer said pro-democracy demonstrators taunted armed men outside a
police station as marines arrived on patrol. When one of the armed men
raised a sub-machine gun, a marine shot him dead and a gunfight broke out,
the officer said. A US sailor was slightly hurt.
Gen Cedras accused the US of atrocities and demanded the court-martial of a
marine colonel, but the US brushed aside his angry reaction. Hundreds of
jubilant Haitians yesterday ransacked police stations and an army barracks
in the town, as soldiers and police abandoned their posts. The crowd carried
off beds, tables, desks, electric fans and stacks of papers, before US
marines restored order.
A leader of the Haitian paramilitary voiced concern that violence could
spread to the capital, Port-au-Prince. 'Things are getting tense,' he said.
'I feel in danger from the mobs.'
Dozens of demonstrators, emboldened by the presence of US troops in Haiti,
staged an unprecedented mock funeral for Gen Cedras outside the airport in
Port-au-Prince.
Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the US Senate armed services committee and a
member of former president Jimmy Carter's team that negotiated the Haitian
generals' agreement to leave power, warned there might be more conflict.
'This is the first bad incident we've had involving, directly, American
troops, but it won't be the last,' he said.
In New York, Mr Clinton last night had talks with UN secretary-general Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali on plans for turning over the US mission in Haiti to
UN peacekeepers. The weekend gun battle is likely to increase the pressure
on the Clinton administration to get US troops out of Haiti as quickly as
possible.
The exiled president, Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom the US wants restored
to power, declared yesterday he would call the Haitian parliament into
session on Wednesday to consider the plan to grant an amnesty for the
military rulers who ousted him.
The military rulers agreed to step down when an amnesty is passed, and the
exiled president, who is still in the US, clearly hopes to speed their
departure.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Port-au-Prince tense as armed men roam the streets

THE Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince was tense yesterday, with many shops
and offices closed and heavily-armed men roaming the almost empty streets.
Public transport was at a standstill. Small-arms and machine-gun fire was
heard through the night, following Monday's violent demonstrations which
prevented the landing of US troops on a UN mission intended to oversee the
restoration of democracy on the island.
The offices of national radio and television were occupied by plainclothes
police auxiliaries, known as 'attaches', who also led Monday's
demonstrations.
The UN special representative in Haiti, Mr Dante Caputo, cancelled a planned
trip to Washington because of the incident. He blamed the Haitian military
for Monday's incident, saying the attacks were an insult to the UN and a
clear violation of the agreements signed in New York between the army and
exiled president Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, due to return to Haiti at the
end of this month under the peace plan.
The USS Harlan County, carrying the troops, remained anchored outside port
yesterday as US officials tried to negotiate a plan for its safe arrival.
In Washington Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, yesterday accused
Haiti's military leaders of violating the UN-mediated accord and warned that
if sanctions were reimposed, they would be severe.
'By their actions, Gen (Raoul) Cedras and Chief of Police (Joseph Michel)
Francois are inviting reimposition of severe economic sanctions that could
affect their country and would also affect them personally,' Mr Christopher
said.
Gen Cedras, who led the 1991 coup which ousted Mr Aristide, condemned the
violence but said he sympathised with the Haitians' outrage at the threat to
their sovereignty.

<TEXT>
   The military coup in Haiti will not
interrupt Haiti's efforts to regain millions of dollars allegedly
taken by dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier when he fled to France,
attorneys representing Haiti said Tuesday.
   A judge was to be selected Monday in this southern French city
to hear the case against Duvalier, accused of misappropriating $120
million in public funds.
   In Haiti's capital of Port-au-Prince on Monday, Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy re-established military rule by decree and named his own
government a few hours after ousting President Leslie Manigat's
civilian government.
   The coup crushed hopes for the democracy promised two years ago
after Duvalier was toppled, ending his family's 29-year
dictatorship.
   ``We are not lawyers for the government but for the Haitian
state,'' said attorney Yann Colin, who represents Haiti in its
French legal proceedings.
   In April a French court ruled it had jurisdiction in the case
against Duvalier.
   The Haitian national lottery, office of vehicle insurance,
gaming commission and Port-au-Prince Bank are demanding that
Duvalier and members of his entourage reimburse the government.
   Colin claimed the $120 million requested represents only part of
what Duvalier diverted.
   Since arriving in France Feb. 7, 1986, Duvalier has lived with
his wife, Michelle, and other family members in a luxurious mansion
in southern France rented from Saudi millionaire Adnan Kashoggi.
   Duvalier has declined to comment on political developments in
Haiti since his downfall.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers who toppled the regime of
Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy mutinied against more commanders Wednesday
and civilians rallied to join the uprising. Witnesses said a
12-year-old boy was killed when troops fired on a crowd.
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, made president Sunday after a coup led
by Namphy's Presidential Guard, tried to quell the military
uprising Tuesday by naming a new armed forces chief and retiring
nine unpopular commanding officers.
   ``The situation is precarious. After all, we are in the midst of
a general mutiny,'' a Western diplomat said Wednesday.
   Coup leaders who put Avril in power demanded that he institute
democratic reforms, including free elections that Haiti has not had
in 31 years. But even though Avril appealed for calm, the purge
that put him in power continued to spread to military barracks and
the streets.
   Radio Haiti Inter said army units opposed to Avril attacked a
crowd in this capital city at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday and that a
12-year-old boy, identified as Nilo Chailes, was killed and three
people were wounded.
   Witnesses said the crowd was on its way to pillage the home of a
sergeant known for his brutality when soldiers fired.
   The station said mutineers battled other soldiers, with one
soldier killed in a clash Tuesday in Jacmel, about 45 miles south
of Port-au-Prince.
   Mutineers on Wednesday were rounding up agents of Namphy's
Bureau of Criminal Investigatons and leaving them at army
headquarters in Port-au-Prince. before cheering crowds, Radio Haiti
Inter reported.
   Radio stations said ousted military commanders were also being
dropped off _some in handcuffs _ at the headquarters, but their
fate was unclear.
   Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic radio station, reported
Wednesday that Sergo Joseph, arrested Aug. 5 for writing an
anti-government slogan on a wall, was freed by a judge Tuesday
night.
   He was severely beaten after his arrest and the human rights
group Amnesty International campaigned for his release.
   In Cap Haitien, a crowd plundered the residence of Louis Noisin,
a former Senate president, Radio Haiti Inter reported.
   On Tuesday, civilians supporting the mutineers engaged in mob
killings and workers at government companies struck to unseat
state-appointed managers, actions apparently aimed at wiping out
remnants of Namphy's rule.
   ``The demands of the mutineers have been accepted; it has become
a people's army, at least for the moment,'' the diplomat said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Organizers canceled a demonstration at St. Jean Bosco Roman
Catholic Church planned for Wednesday to support the soldiers'
rebellion and rescheduled it for Thursday. The organizers, members
of a leftist coalition, said they would meet instead with Avril and
Sgt. Joseph Heubreux, leader of Saturday's coup.
   ``I came to Port-au-Prince from the country to participate in
the demonstration,'' said Andre-Juste Pierre, 32, an unemployed
welder from Cabaret, 20 miles north of the capital. ``I don't feel
frustrated because the military government is afraid. We'll
demonstrate tomorrow.''
   About 100 people gathered in front of the burned-out ruins of
the church, staring at the charred, mutilated body of a thug killed
by a mob Tuesday.
   Witnesses identified him as an ex-officer of the Tonton
Macoutes, the dreaded private army of the Duvalier dictatorship.
They said the man took part in the Sept. 11 massacre of 13
parishioners at the church that provoked Saturday's coup.
   The government's dismissal of eight generals and a colonel
followed the ouster by soldiers of at least 11 commanders
nationwide since Monday.
   In St. Marc, about 60 miles north of the capital, residents took
to the streets Wednesday to punish thugs allegedly allied with the
local army commander. Soldiers fired rifles into the air to
disperse them, Radio Metropole reported.
   Among officers retired Tuesday was former Defense Minister Brig.
Gen. Williams Regala, despised in Haiti for his ties to the
dictatorship of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier and his son,
Jean-Claude. Namphy headed a three-man junta that ruled Haiti after
the younger Duvalier was forced into exile on Feb. 7, 1986.
   Central Bank employees went on strike Wednesday demanding the
board of directors resign, Radio Metropole said.
   Employees of at least the state flour mill and electric company
joined the military mutiny and ousted their bosses Tuesday.
Unpopular managers of other government companies also were
expelled, radio stations said, but details were sketchy.
   Radio stations estimated that up to 12 Tonton Macoutes had been
killed by mobs and soldiers since Sunday.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The military commander of
Cap-Haitien, Haiti's second-largest city, has prohibited street
demonstrations until further notice, the independent radio station
Haiti-Inter reported Monday.
   Col. Carrel Occil, military commander of the northern coastal
town, issued the order on Saturday in response to plans for
upcoming demonstrations, the radio said.
   Neighboorhood citizens' committees had been planning
demonstrations against unpopular government officials and in
support of the Sept. 17 coup that initiated a nationwide movement
of reform, it said.
   Since the ouster of the military government of Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy by rank-and-file soldiers of the Presidential Guard on Sept.
17, dozens of commanders with ties to the Duvalier regime were
removed throughout Haiti and unpopular and repressive army officers
and government officials dismissed.
   An unidentified member of a Cap-Haitien neighborhood committee
told Haiti-Inter that ``nothing has changed,'' that anti-democratic
officials are still holding office.
   In recent declarations, such prominent political leaders as
Louis Dejoie Jr. and Sylvio Claude have been calling on the
government to make a clean sweep of members of the dreaded Tonton
Macoutes from public office.
   In a related development, club-swinging soldiers broke up a
demonstration Sunday against the rural police in Petite Riviere, a
town in the Artibonite Province 40 miles north of Port-au-Prince,
Haiti-Inter reported.
   The soldiers, from the garrison of Gonaives to the north of the
town, arrested two protesters and dispersed the crowd by shooting
into the air. None of the people who were clubbed was seriously
injured, Haiti-Inter reported.
   Last week in the same town, 2,000 people demonstrated without
incident.
   In recent days, however, the army has intervened to quell
rallies.
   Last Wednesday, soldiers shot and killed a protester in a
demonstration of squatters in the capital, and two weekends ago, in
Cote-de-Fer, a small southern coastal town, a popular tribunal
composed of citizens and local soldiers was disbanded without
incident by the army.
   Dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier ruled Haiti since 1957
and was succeeded by his son, Jean-Claude, who fled into exile in
February 1986 in the midst of a popular uprising.
   Namphy led a three-man junta that governed this Caribbean island
nation until Leslie Manigat was elected president last January in
elections widely viewed as fraudulent.
   Namphy ousted Manigat and declared himself president on June 20.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In attacks political and civic
leaders blame on thugs angered by the shift from army to civilian
rule, marauding gunmen have killed at least 19 people this week,
officials and radio reports say.
   The victims included 11 members of a self-defense group hacked
to death in the town of Petit Goave, the birthplace of nationwide
demonstrations that forced Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril from power.
   In the capital of Port-au-Prince Wednesday, assailants killed at
least four people and wounded eight, according to the reports. The
wounded included five members of a self-defense unit shot by gunmen
in speeding cars.
   The Unity Assembly, the political and civic coalition that chose
provisional President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot after Avril went into
exile last week, has urged the formation of self-defense units.
   There has been a dearth of police protection since Avril fled.
   The Unity Assembly said thugs and members of the
ill-disciplined, 6,000-man army _ the traditional power broker in
this impoverished Caribbean nation _ are angry at the military's
surrender of power to civilians.
   ``These acts of urban terrorism have been committed by
irreconcilable supporters of dictatorship,'' politician Rockefeller
Guerre said Wednesday. Others said the attacks were aimed at
destabilizing the civilian government.
   An official at the state hospital in Port-au-Prince said the
morgue received the bodies of two people shot before dawn
Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the hospital treated eight people _ including the five members of a
self-defense unit _ for bullet wounds.
   Privately owned Radio Haiti Inter said gunmen trying to hold up
a rice storehouse downtown killed security guard William Desir late
Wednesday and shot up the building before driving off and shooting
at passers-by.
   And it said fishermen in the seafront neighborhood of Carrefour
on Wednesday found the body of an unidentified, naked man with his
hands tied behind his back.
   The Roman Catholic station Radio Soleil, Radio Haiti Inter and
an independent source said 13 people, including 11 members of a
neighborhood self-defense group, were killed Tuesday in Petit
Goave, 50 miles southwest of the capital.
   Radio Haiti Inter said the 11 were hacked to death by a gang of
assailants while searching for the killers of an elderly couple who
were shot and disemboweled earlier in the day.
   On Tuesday night, 1,000 police at checkpoints in Port-au-Prince
searched private vehicles for weapons, state television said.
   A soldier was shot to death in the capital by unknown assailants
Monday, and eight nuns at a Roman Catholic girls' school were
beaten and injured by machete-wielding assailants who broke into
their compound on Sunday.
   Haiti has had five governments since a February 1986 popular
uprising forced dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier into exile in France.
   All but the current government were dominated by the military.
   Avril was elevated to power 18 months ago in a coup by
rank-and-file soldiers who said they were outraged with
state-sanctioned murder and corruption.
   His resignation followed a week of nationwide demonstrations
sparked by the killing by the army of an 11-year-old girl on her
porch in Petit Goave.
   If the current government holds general elections as promised,
the next government will be the first chosen by the people since
Haiti declared independence from France in 1804.

   Here is a brief look at Haiti, where a military coup late Sunday
ousted the first country's first civilian-elected president in 30
years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE LAND:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Haiti covers 10,700 square miles, slightly larger than Maryland.
Most of the land is arid and mountainous, deeply eroded and
treeless, an infertile environment that allows little more than
subsistence farming. On the west, Haiti faces Cuba and the
Caribbean Sea. To the east is the Spanish-speaking Dominican
Republic, which covers the eastern, more fertile, two-thirds of the
island of Hispaniola.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE PEOPLE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Ninety-five percent of Haitians are descendants of African
slaves brought to the New World to cut sugar cane. A great slave
revolt led by former slave Toussaint L'Ouverture eventually led to
victory over Napoleon's troops and independence from France on Jan.
1, 1804. Haiti was the first black republic in history. Today, it
is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country. Life expectancy is 54
years, per capita income $379 a year, and 85 of every 100 Haitians
live in absolute poverty. Only 13 of 100 Haitians have access to
potable water. Thousands, including about 15,000 abandoned or
orphaned children, live and sleep in the streets of the capital,
Port-au-Prince, without shelter, sanitary facilities or other
necessities. Only about 60,000 of the country's 6 million people
live what would be considered in the United States a middle class
lifestyle. These priviledged few, mostly light-skinned mulattos,
own about 46 percent of the national wealth.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HISTORY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Following independence, Haiti ruled the entire island of
Hispaniola from 1818 to 1839. U.S. troops occupied Haiti from 1915
to 1934 following a long period of instability. After World War II,
a 10-year boom brought foreign investment, tourism and public works
on a grand scale, although little was done to increase public
services for the poor. Another period of turmoil culminated in 1957
with the election of Francois Duvalier, a doctor who declared
himself president for life in 1964. ``Papa Doc,'' as he was called,
died in 1971 and was succeeded by his 19-year-old son, Jean-Claude.
The Duvalier family amassed an immense fortune and created the
notorious Tonton Macoutes, a vicious private militia that throttled
political opposition by arresting, torturing and killing at will.
Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled to exile in France in
February 1986 after food riots grew into nationwide anti-government
demonstrations. A military-civilian junta led by Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy took power and agreed to hold elections. An independently
run election Nov. 29 was suspended because of widespread violence
that the army made no effort to stop. On Jan. 24, Leslie F.
Manigat, a 57-year-old former political science professor, was
declared the winner in the election that critics claim was
fraudulent. His government was installed in February. Manigat
retired Namphy as commander in chief of Haiti's 7,000-man army on
Friday, charging him with insubordination in ordering the transfer
of lower-ranking officers three days earlier. Late Sunday, Namphy
led a coup that ousted Namphy.

<TEXT>
ASSASSINS yesterday killed Haiti's justice minister and at least two other
people in an escalation of the violence that has set the country's military
leaders on a collision course with the US administration, Reuter reports
from Port-au-Prince.
Justic Minister Guy Malary was shot dead in Port-au-Prince, the capital,
shortly after President Bill Clinton had warned Haitian military leaders to
restore democracy. Mr Malary, a wealthy lawyer, was a supporter of ousted
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is intended to return to the country
under a United Nations peace accord signed by General Raoul Cedras, the army
chief.
The Haitian government said that Mr Malary's bodyguard and driver were also
killed and local radio said there were unconfirmed reports of a fourth
death. The minister's car was found riddled with bullets beside a church
where another supporter of President Aristide was shot dead last month.
In another show of defiance against international pressure, members of a
pro-military group marched into parliament, briefly held some legislators
hostage and expressed their support for Gen Cedras, local radio reported.
Nearly all cabinet ministers, who were sworn into office last month, have
received death threats from civilian gunmen known as 'attaches' for their
links to police and army. Mr Malary had been spearheading legislation to
separate Haiti's army and police, a crucial step in the UN accord.
Earlier yesterday, police chief Michel Francois, who controls
Port-au-Prince, vowed he would not bend to international pressure and give
up power. 'I'm Haitian and I've chosen to die in my country,' he said.
His supporters said they would paralyse Port-au-Prince with a general strike
on Monday, the day international sanctions imposed by the United Nations
take effect.
Mr Dante Caputo, the chief UN envoy to Haiti, said even the immediate
resignation of Gen Cedras was not enough to call off the UN sanctions. He
said he wanted hard proof that the army would halt growing street violence
before the UN considered cancelling the planned oil embargo and freeze of
Haiti's assets.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy formed a
military government Monday with himself in charge, after deposing
the 4-month-old civilian administration of President Leslie Manigat.
   The 55-year-old career soldier named a 12-member Cabinet that
included only one civilian, and said he would rule by decree as the
new president.
   ``The army will lead the country this way,'' Namphy declared on
national television shortly after the coup, waving an Uzi
submachine gun and flanked by soldiers.
   Manigat, who was seized Sunday evening at his hillside villa
outside Port-au-Prince, arrived in neighboring Dominican Republic
on Monday with his family, said military sources in Santo Domingo.
   In a statement issued through a spokesman of the hotel where
Manigat and his family were staying, the 57-year-old ousted
president said he was not injured in the coup.
   The administration of President Joaquin Balaguer gave no
official statement, but Foreign Ministry sources said Manigat was a
``guest of the Dominican government'' and might travel Tuesday
afternoon to Venezuela, where he had been offered political asylum.
   Except for a few random shots heard, Port-au-Prince was quiet
Monday night. There were no reports of unrest in the provinces. Men
and women strolled past the national palace and children played
soccer at a closed gasoline station two blocks away.
   In a short live broadcast on state-run television from the
National Palace, Namphy said Manigat ``betrayed your confidence and
violated the constitution he swore to uphold.''
   ``The future of democracy was at stake,'' said the general, who
was accompanied by elements of every unit in Haiti's 7,000-member
armed forces. ``The army must protect the superior interests of the
country and must head the country. To this end, a military
government has been formed.''
   Namphy, who spoke in French for about five minutes, pledged to
``guarantee that all the conquests of Feb. 7 (when his three-man
junta turned over the government to Manigat) will be respected. To
our powerful friends and to international organizations, I
guarantee the respect of all commitments.''
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said in Washington:
``The United States government strongly condemns this serious blow
to hopes for democracy in that troubled land.''
   Namphy's action halted, at least for now, the slow journey
toward democracy begun after President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled
the country Feb. 7, 1986, ending the 29-year dictatorship founded
by his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.
   The general, who was Jean-Claude Duvalier's chief of staff, led
the junta that ruled Haiti until Manigat won a presidential
election this year with the army's help.
   Haiti, a nation of 6 million people and the poorest country in
the Western Hemisphere, shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola
with the Dominican Republic.
   Manigat began his disastrous confrontation with the army, the
traditional base of power since independence in 1804, by removing
Namphy as commander on Friday. Manigat also reassigned two dozen
other officers Sunday, many of them Namphy's allies.
   He accused Namphy of insubordination for ordering the transfers
of several officers without presidential permission, including
Manigat's main military ally, Lt. Col. Jean-Claude Paul. The
barracks of Paul's command, the 700-man Dessalines Battalion, is
directly behind the National Palace.
   Paul, who has been indicted by a U.S. federal court on charges
of drug trafficking, was in the group standing around Namphy during
the television appearance Monday, but whether he had allied himself
with the general was unclear.
   The military announced a new Cabinet, dissolution of the
National Assembly and Namphy's intention to rule by decree.
   Col. Gary Leon, general secretary of the armed forces, read the
names of the Cabinet members on television. Gen. Williams Regala,
who was defense minister under Manigat and signed the order
retiring Namphy, will be minister of defense and interior.
   No public opposition greeted Namphy on his first day back in the
palace. There were no rallies for Manigat, whose political
headquarters was ransacked.
   The international airport in Port-au-Prince was closed, along
with most schools and businesses in the capital. Car and pedestrian
traffic was curtailed. Overseas telephone lines were closed down
and an employee at the government telephone company, Teleco, said
Namphy ordered it.
   Few soldiers were in the streets and there were no military
checkpoints.
   Namphy had been under house arrest but was freed Sunday night,
apparently with aid of the presidential guard and the Leopards
counter-insurgency unit using three tanks.
   Shooting began in front of the palace at about 7:30 p.m. Sunday
as the presidential guard and Leopards battled Paul's Dessalines
Battalion. At 1:30 a.m. Monday, Namphy announced the coup on
television in a broadcast from the palace.
   There were no official reports on casualties but Haitian
journalists said some soldiers loyal to Manigat were killed. U.S.
Embassy spokesman Jeffrey Lite said no Americans were injured.

<HEAD>Human Rights Activist Stabbed To Death in Haiti, Government Blamed</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lafontant Joseph, a prominent human
rights activist, was found beaten and stabbed to death Monday in a
jeep near the Port-au-Prince airport, police said.
   ``This murder is a very serious incident,'' Jean-Claude Bajeux,
director of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights, told The
Associated Press. ``It means that the lives of all militants for
human rights in Haiti are in danger.''
   Paul Latortue, a former senatorial candidate who lives in exile
in Puerto Rico, blamed the murder on government leader Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy.
   ``I have no doubt that this is a political killing,'' he said.
``It's connected with the government.''
   Joseph, 54, director of Haiti's Center of Education for Human
Rights, was found dead in his four-wheel drive vehicle near Mais
Gate International Airport, just outside the capital. A passerby
recognized the dead man and contacted his family.
   The activist's nephew, physician Ronald Joseph, said Joseph had
been stabbed once in his chest and two or three times in his back.
``The body looked mutilated,'' he said.
   Army Maj. Joseph Baguidy, head of Haiti's Bureau of Criminal
Investigation, said police found blood about 500 yards from the
car, indicating Joseph was killed outside the vehicle.
   There appeared to be more than one assailant, Baguidy said. He
did not elaborate.
   The police official said the seats of the car were found in a
horizontal position and that police discovered a pair of women's
sandals in the vehicle.
   He said it was possible a woman may have been in the car with
Joseph, but that no other body had been located.
   ``We are now examining the blood to see whether there was
another victim,'' he said.
   Radio Metropole, an independent station, said Joseph was last
seen alive by his wife, Raymonde, whom he dropped off at their home
Sunday night. Mrs. Joseph, director of the Haitian Women's
Committee Against Torture, was the first to identify her husband's
body.
   Joseph, a lawyer, founded the Center of Education for Human
Rights in 1986 and was a co-founder of the League of Human Rights.
   In November 1980, under dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, he was
arrested, jailed and tortured for his outspoken criticism of the
government. Joseph was then ordered to leave Haiti, but refused to
do so.
   Before the national elections scheduled for November 29, which
were suspended because of civil violence, Joseph was a candidate
for a Senate seat on the leftist National Front ticket.
   At the time of his death, the activist was director of the
Elliot Pierre High School.
   Latortue said the killing was connected with an incident last
week in which four men in black uniforms with Uzi machine guns
burst into the home of sociologist Laennec Hurbon while he was
away, ransacked the premises and stole $1,300.
   Joseph and Laennec were both prominent members of the National
Congress of Democratic Movements, a political group working to
organize Haitians and uphold the constitution.
   ``It's an attempt to kill one by one those who argue for
democratic development,'' said Latortue, whose brother Gerard was
foreign minister in the government of President Leslie Manigat, who
was ousted in June.
   ``We have entered a different phase in Haiti now where political
killings in the street are going to take place. They don't arrest
you, they kill you in the streets and make it appear that it is the
work of bandits.''
   ``Haitians now live within a system which gives the lives and
property of its citizens no protection. Anything can happen and no
one can prevent any determined gang of killers from doing as it
sees fit,'' Bajeux said.
   Namphy, who took power in a coup June 19, suspended the
constitution Haitians approved in a March 1987 referendum.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's new military government has
retired a powerful army colonel who was indicted on U.S. drug
charges and was once considered a leading candidate for chief of
the armed forces.
   A few bursts of gunfire were heard around Port-au-Prince late
Friday, but there was no obvious sign today that Col. Jean-Claude
Paul was resisting the retirement. It was not known where he was.
   Several Haitian leaders hailed the retirement after it was
announced Friday. They said it showed that the 2-week-old
government was moving in the right direction.
   ``They are giving proof of their sincerity to oust
Duvalierists,'' said Louis Dejoie, a former presidential candidate.
He was referring to dictators Francois Duvalier and his son,
Jean-Claude, who ruled Haiti for 29 years until the younger
Duvalier was swept from power in a popular uprising in February
1986.
   Both Haitian and diplomatic sources said Paul's retirement could
eventually lead to renewed U.S. aid to Haiti, which was cut off
after a massacre of 34 people during elections last November in
this Caribbean nation.
   ``The situation is positive and encouraging,'' said Susan Clyde,
the U.S. Embassy spokeswoman. She said the embassy was told that
Paul had been replaced by his second-in-command, Lt. Col. Guy
Francois, an American-trained officer.
   The brief announcement on state television late Friday said only
that Paul was retired from the army and his post as commander of
the feared 700-man Dessalines Barracks in Port-au-Prince.
   The announcer said the decision was signed by Haiti's president,
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, and by the minister of defense and
interior, Col. Carl Dorsainvil. It did not say when the retirement
took effect.
   In March, Paul was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami
that accused him of conspiring to import cocaine into the United
States. Paul has denied any involvement.
   As head of the largest unit in Haiti's 7,000-member army, Paul
had been considered one of the most powerful figures in the
military. Haitian officials had said he could be named armed forces
chief shortly after Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy took power in a military
coup on Sept. 17.
   However, officials in Washington said such a move could hurt
U.S.-Haitian relations, and it never materialized.
   In June, Namphy had reassigned Paul to an administrative
position, but Paul refused and was backed by then-President Leslie
Manigat. Namphy ousted Manigat. Paul remained head of his battalion.
   Paul has been linked to the November massacre of voters at a
polling place and to the Tonton Macoutes, the hated personal
security forces of the Duvaliers.
   Told of Paul's retirement, one Western diplomat said, ``This
means that the American government will certainly reinitiate
assistance to Haiti, but will Jean-Claude Paul accept his
retirement?''
   A Haitian government official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was surprised by the development, which he
called ``a door wide open'' to restoration of U.S. aid.
   The $70 million annual package, Haiti's largest source of
foreign aid, was ended after the election massacre.
   Dejoie said Friday, ``Now the guns have changed shoulders. I am
very pleased at the attitude of this government. The house-cleaning
is still going on in the army.''
   After rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Namphy two weeks ago,
they installed Avril as president under a new military government.
They said they wanted to end random, state-sponsored violence and
institute democratic reforms, but the new rulers have set no date
for elections.
   The week after the coup, chaos ruled as soldiers around the
country rebelled against commanders and civilian mobs scoured the
country looking for people linked to the Duvalier regimes.
   About 10,000 mostly young people danced in the streets of
Port-au-Prince on Thursday in support of the soldiers' coup. It was
one of the biggest outpourings seen in the capital since
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in France. Some of them
chanted ``Long Live Paul, Down With America.''

<HEAD>Caribbean Religious Group Condemns Haiti's Rulers for Church
Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Caribbean Council of Churches
denounced the killing of 13 parishioners and the burning of two
churches in Haiti and urged the U.S. and Caribbean governments to
condemn Haiti's military rulers.
   But late Saturday, Haiti deposed its military leader, Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, and two military commanders took power, a government
spokesman said in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital.
   It was unclear whether the attacks on Sept. 11 and the following
day, blamed on the government, were related to Namphy's ouster.
   The church council, which represents Roman Catholic and
Protestant churches in 16 Caribbean countries, said the bloody
attacks were ``cold-blooded cruelty which was shocking even by the
brutal standards of Haitian repression.''
   While army critic Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide said Mass Sept. 11
at St. Jean Bosco Church in Haiti, two dozen people armed with guns
and knives attacked killed parishioners before burning down the
building as soldiers watched from across the street.
   Nine were killed in the massacre and 77 were wounded, of which
four died at in the hospital, Radio Haiti Inter said Saturday.
   Five men and a woman that night boasted on government television
they took part in the massacre, and the next day arsonists burned
down a second Roman Catholic church.
   ``The inaction of the government security forces can only be
interpreted as collusion with the method of terrorizing the Haitian
population into silence,'' said the council's statement, released
Friday.
   Though the government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy said it
``regretted'' the massacre and promised to punish the culprits,
similar statements issued after mass killings in the past have
never resulted in investigations or convictions.
   Namphy returned to power after ousting the 4-month-old
government of civilian President Leslie Manigat in a coup June 19.
Namphy previously ruled for two years after the exile to France of
President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier on Feb. 7, 1986.
   But on Saturday, Namphy was ousted in a military coup and taken
to the airport, said Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information.
Lubin said he believed Commander Prosper Avril had been named the
new head of state and Dessalines Barracks Commander Jean-Claude
Paul as new commander-in-chief of the army.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Col. Jean-Claude Paul, the forcibly
retired commander of Haiti's most feared army unit who was indicted
on U.S. drug charges, died Sunday under suspicious circumstances, a
family friend said. He was 49.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said Paul, a 29-year army veteran and one of
Haiti's most powerful figures, died of a heart attack at about 3
p.m. in his home in suburban Fermathe. The independent station gave
no other details.
   A family friend said there was speculation Paul was poisoned,
possibly prior to having a heart attack.
   The friend, who would not be identified further, said Paul's
housemaid and yardman were arrested and taken to Petionville police
station for questioning about the colonel's death.
   Paul's former wife, Mireille Delinois, was taken to the station
Sunday night and was under police protection because of fear of
reprisals by Paul's relatives, the friend said.
   The military government's spokesman, Frantz Lubin, said he had no
information on Paul's death. U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde
also said she had nothing. The capital, Port-au-Prince, appeared
calm.
   Paul was fired Sept. 30 after a coup led by noncommissioned
officers ousted Haiti's military leader, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy,
replacing him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   The coup leaders said they were outraged with the state-sponsored
murder and corruption Namphy tolerated.
   Paul had commanded the 700-man Dessalines Battalion, the most
brutal unit in Haiti's 7,000-member army, and had been linked to the
Tonton Macoutes, the hated private army of the 29-year Duvalier
family dictatorship.
   Soldiers under Paul's command have been blamed for widespread
violence that has thwarted moves toward democratization promised
after a popular uprising drove Jean-Claude Duvalier into exile in
February 1986.
   The violence included attacks on polling stations that forced the
cancellation of independently run general elections last November,
leaving at least 34 people dead.
   Paul had been considered one of the most powerful members of the
army, which has run this impoverished Caribbean nation for most of
its 144 years.
   In March, he was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami on
charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.
   Soldiers who staged the Sept. 17 rebellion that ousted Namphy
said they wanted to name Paul the army chief but decided not to
because of the drug charges.
   Immediately after the coup, Paul appeared to be allied with
Avril, but the new leader reportedly became concerned that Paul
might turn against him. Avril had already ousted about 60 of the
army's most repressive commanders.
   Haitian and diplomatic sources later said Paul's retirement could
help lead to the renewal of a $70 million annual aid package the
United States cut off after the November 1987 election massacre. One
of the conditions the Reagan administration has set for renewing aid
is that Haiti cooperate in halting the flow of drugs through Haiti
into the United States.
   The drug trafficking indictment alleges Paul conspired to import
220 pounds of cocaine into the United States in December 1986. It
says the traffickers used a landing strip on Paul's farm 90 miles
outside Port-au-Prince to load and fly the shipment to the Bahamas.
   Fritz Pierre-Louis, a former lieutenant in the Haitian army who
later defected, told Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Bob Graham,
D-Fla. in a special U.S. Senate hearing that 70 percent of Paul's
troops were involved in drug trafficking.
   Namphy led a military junta that assumed power when Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled into exile in France.
   An attempt to dismiss Paul in June failed and led to the fall of
the civilian government of Leslie F. Manigat, who won military-run
presidential elections in January.
   Namphy had reassigned Paul to an administrative post, but Paul
refused and was backed by Manigat. Namphy ousted Manigat on June 20,
accusing him of meddling in army affairs, and Paul remained head of
his battalion.
   Paul did not intervene when soldiers overthrew Namphy in
September.
   The soldiers who formed Haiti's new government have said they
want to end random, state-sponsored violence and institute
democratic reforms, but the government has set no dates for
elections.

<TEXT>
Fresh violence broke out in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince yesterday as
a demonstration celebrating the expected return of Haiti's democratic
government degenerated into a pitched battle, leaving at least three people
dead and over a dozen injured.
The fighting, after a grenade attack that killed five people on Thursday,
marked a resurgence of clashes that threaten US efforts to restore democracy
to the Caribbean nation.
Yesterday's confrontation, erupted, when paramilitaries loyal to the
military regime attacked a crowd marching on the third anniversary of the
coup that toppled elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The incidents
throw into doubt the capacity of the US military, numbering 20,000 troops,
to guarantee civilians security for free political expression. They have
also increased pressure on the US to pursue a more forceful disarmament of
Haitian paramilitaries.
The demonstration followed mass at Port-au-Prince cathedral, where Father
Amos called for reconciliation between military loyalists and Aristide
supporters. The mass was attended by Mr Robert Malval, Mr Aristide's
nominated premier, who emerged from hiding to sit in the front pew, across
the aisle from Mr William Swing, US ambassador.
Last night Mr Aristide urged Haitians to halt the fighting. 'There should be
neither violence nor vengeance.' He was noncommital about when he would
return to Port-au-Prince, suggesting it could be 'before October 15' - the
date Haiti's military are due to step down.
The crowd had followed the official route for the demonstration past the
offices of Fraph, a militia faction loyal to the military government of
Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras. Fraph paramilitaries were understood to
have thrown stones at and opened fire on the demonstrators, who took cover.
A suspected member of the paramilitary group was chased and beaten to death
by the crowd.
Observers say low-ranking officers of the police and army have relinquished
their responsibilities.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Haiti declares emergency as UN sanctions tighten
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Haiti's army-backed government has declared a state of emergency after the
tightening of economic sanctions against the Caribbean nation and amid
intensified rumours of impending foreign military intervention to remove the
military and reinstate Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the exiled president.
The announcement of the emergency by Mr Emile Jonassaint, recently appointed
head of the government by the army, coincided with an attempt by several
thousand Haitians and hundreds of foreigners to leave the country before the
termination of commercial flights, one of several new sanctions against
Haiti, takes effect.
The US and Canada say they will end commercial flights to Haiti on June 25
to increase pressure on the military rulers who took power in a coup 30
months ago. France is also expected to end commercial flights, but it is not
yet known whether other countries which have air links to Haiti, including
the Netherlands, Panama and the Dominican Republic, will do the same.
In a further show of defiance, the Haitian military said it would close the
country's main airport in Port au Prince, the capital, and several smaller
airfields, five days before the new sanctions takes effect.
Foreigners have been told by their governments to leave Haiti quickly, and
several governments are also evacuating family members of their diplomatic
staff. Most of the Haitians who have been purchasing tickets to leave the
country are children and women who are being sent abroad as the tighter
sanctions take effect.
Concerns about public safety increased over the weekend after the military
seized guns from several US marines entering the country. US officials said
the marines were assigned to duties at the US embassy in Port au Prince, as
part of a normal rotation of guards.
The imposition of a state of emergency will not change the situation in the
country. The military and its police arm have been exercising powers in a
virtual state of siege since economic sanctions were put into effect soon
after the coup.
Diplomats in Port au Prince said yesterday the declaration of the emergency,
and decision to close airports before the June 25 deadline, were part of the
military government's display of defiance of efforts to have Mr Aristide
returned.

<TEXT>
Caribbean troops and a group of returning Haitian refugees arrived in the
Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince yesterday, which suggests that the US
military believes it is in full control just 10 days before the scheduled
return of exiled President Jean Bertrand Aristide.
The 262 Caricom troops from Jamaica, Trinidad, Belize and Barbados will be
in charge of security at the port in the capital. This has become a vital
task as humanitarian aid begins to pour in now that US troops have set up
distribution networks.
Some 492 refugees arrived from the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
A total of 14,000 refugees remain outside Haiti, but US officials expect 500
a day to arrive should the country remain calm.
Political tensions have been partly defused by a virtual breakdown in the
Haitian police force now that its leader, Lt Col Michel Francois, has fled
to the Dominican Republic.
Police officers were completely absent from Haitian streets yesterday,
remaining at their headquarters even while sporadic looting took place
across the street from the US embassy.
US soldiers have worked with Haitians in recent days to locate the homes of
suspected army auxiliaries, who terrorised the population with their harsh
crackdown against supporters of Mr Aristide.
But with thousands of weapons still reported to be in the hands of
pro-regime auxiliaries and other extremists and some Haitians thirsting for
revenge, the potential for violence remains high.
Parliament yesterday continued to debate the granting of a general amnesty,
a condition for de facto leader Lt Gen Raoul Cedras to step down, but
appeared unable to arrive at a consensus.

The price of black market petrol shot up in fuel-starved Haiti after a
weekend explosion and fire destroyed a big depot for fuel smuggled into
Haiti in defiance of a UN embargo, AP reports from Port-au-Prince.
Fuel prices jumped from about 110 gourdes (about Dollars 8.50 or Pounds
5.80) a gallon to 135 gourdes since the blaze on Saturday night, according
to checks at several sales outlets yesterday.
Tens of thousands of gallons of fuel - increasingly precious in Haiti since
the imposition of the UN embargo in October - were destroyed in the blaze
that gutted a half-block of Rue de Cesars in downtown Port-au-Prince.
Authorities reported no casualties, and all sides blamed carelessness rather
than arson.
The area near the Roman Catholic cathedral had been transformed into a
dangerous stockpile of petrol, kerosene, diesel and other fuels. Most were
kept in plastic jugs and drums, and vendors often smoked while working, even
alongside trucks full of fuel parked on both sides of the avenue.
Two fuel trucks blew up in the explosion, and at least 12 two-story
buildings were destroyed in the fire.
The army has stockpiled petrol in underground depots around the capital, but
the fuel at the burned warehouses was the main source of sales to civilians.
With legal importers observing the embargo, Haitians have been storing fuel
in makeshift stockpiles throughout the capital.
The fuel embargo was imposed to punish the army for blocking the return of
elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted and exiled in a 1991 coup.
With Haiti's poor - Father Aristide's main supporters - already suffering
the most by the embargo, an increase in fuel prices will make things worse
for them.

<HEAD>Demonstration Reported in Port City of St. Marc</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A protest against a customs
officer's arrival in the port city of St. Marc turned into an
anti-government demonstration by more than 5,000 Haitians on
Friday, the Radio Metropole station reported.
   It was one of the first demonstrations reported in Haiti against
the government of Leslie Manigat since he was elected president in
January.
   The station said hundreds of protesters took to the streets
after learning that a customs officer arrived in St. Marc to
enforce a government order to stop illegal entry of imported goods
into this Caribbean island country.
   The officer ordered a halt to the unloading of cargo ships in
St. Marc harbor, about 55 miles northwest of the capital city of
Port-au-Prince.
   Demonstrators first turned their wrath on the unidentified
customs officer.
   Armed with machetes, sticks, knives and stones, they set up
flaming tire barricades and shouted, ``I am going to eat you! I am
going to devour you!,'' the station said.
   Two hours later, the number of protesters swelled to about 5,000
and they turned on the government, shouting, ``Down with
Manigat!,'' Radio Metropole reported.
   No injuries were reported.
   Manigat earlier announced he intended to stop the illegal flow
of goods into Haiti that has flourished since former
President-for-life Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into French exile Feb.
7, 1986.
   The president said his program was aimed at stabilizing the
economy of Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.
Although figures have never made public, the contraband helped
drive down prices in Haiti but cut into government tax revenue.
   Contraband brought to Haiti comes mostly on ships from Miami and
includes second-hand clothing, canned food, cigarettes, rice, and
other consumer goods.
   Since then, port cities have been the focal point of the
government plan.
   Goods valued at $250,000 were confiscated at Miragoane, a port
city 50 miles west of Port-of-Prince. Imported passenger cars were
held at other ports until import duties were paid.
   Radio Haiti-Inter reported two weeks ago that the military
stopped merchants from taking possession of goods at the port of
Cap Haitien on the north coast.

<HEAD>Strike Paralyzes Capital; Radio Report: Duvalier Plans Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A protest strike over the return
from exile of two former officials linked to human rights abuses
under dictatorial regimes on Wednesday paralyzed this normally
bustling capital of 1 million people.
   Meanwhile, the independent Radio Haiti-Inter reported deposed
dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier had booked a flight to
Haiti for July 29 and that two of his former ministers were
expected to arrive Wednesday night.
   Duvalier has lived in exile in France since he was ousted in a
popular uprising in February 1986.
   The radio station gave no attribution for the report, which
could not be independently confirmed.
   The one-day protest strike was supported by political groups,
labor unions and many civic groups. Strike supporters expressed
concern that Duvalier supporters were attempting to make a comeback
in Haiti.
   Downtown shops, open-air markets and gas stations were closed
for the one-day protest, and no buses were running. Streets were
virtually deserted.
   Employers sent home the few assembly line workers who showed up
for work at the sprawling industrial park near the airport,
independent Radio Antilles reported. About 15,000 people are
employed there.
   Reports from Cap-Haitien and Gonaives, Haiti's second- and
third-largest cities, indicated widespread support for the strike
in the provinces. Most businesses were closed but buses were still
running.
   There were no reports of violence.
   Unity Assembly, a coalition of 12 political groups, called the
strike Tuesday after the government failed to comply with its
demand to arrest two former high-ranking officials, Roger Lafontant
and Williams Regala, who returned separately from exile last week.
   As interior and defense minister under ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier,
Lafontant reputedly headed the dreaded Tonton Macoutes paramilitary
force. Duvalier's ouster ended the 29-year dynasty founded by his
father, Francois ``Papa Doc,'' who died in 1971.
   Regala, a retired army major general, served as interior and
defense minister under two previous military regimes. He is widely
regarded as the mastermind of the election day massacre of Nov. 29,
1987, in which thugs supported by the army shot and hacked to death
at least 34 voters at polling stations.
   Lafontant had been living in self-imposed exile in the
neighboring Dominican Republic the past 4{ years.
   Regala fled to the United States in March when military ruler
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril was forced into exile by a popular uprising.
   Their return to Haiti heightened fears of an organized attempt
to disrupt general elections scheduled for Nov. 4.
   Unity Assembly declared in a statement that Lafontant and Regala
``at large are ill omens of growing insecurity and a slap in the
face of justice.''
   In San Juan, Puerto Rico, Paul Laortue, a Senate candidate in
the aborted 1987 elections, said the return of Lafontant and Regala
was a ``very serious test by the Duvalierist sector to find out if
they can make a comeback.''
   ``If these two guys can stay in Haiti, that means that before
the end of the year Jean-Claude Duvalier could attempt to come
back. ... I don't know if he would dare, but it would be viable,''
said Latortue, who now teaches at the University of Puerto Rico.
   The Unity Assembly coalition had given civilian President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot until noon Tuesday to arrest Lafontant and Regala.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, who was appointed president to succeed
Avril, made no public statement in response to the protest.
   Her silence underscored a long-standing rift between the
president and the 19-member Council of State, which was appointed
to govern alongside her in a caretaker civilian government.
   In a statement Monday, the Council of State said Lafontant and
Regala had been widely accused of ``repeated human-rights
violations and illicit enrichment.''
   The council said their return from exile was ``due to the policy
of the present executive (Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot), which hasn't
managed to set the legal process in motion.''
   An arrest warrant for Lafontant, issued Saturday by government
prosecutor Bayard Vincent, was not served. But the police chief,
Col. Jean-Claude Duperval, said it would be, independent Tele-Haiti
reported Tuesday. A second warrant was issued Tuesday morning.

   Three Haitian soldiers armed with rifles and
seeking political asylum forced their way onto an American Airlines
jetliner in Haiti Saturday and flew to New York, officials said.
They were arrested when the plane landed at Kennedy Airport.
   No one was injured in the incident, said American Airlines
spokesman Jim Brown. The three men had surrendered their weapons
before the airplane left Port-au-Prince.
   Airport security and the FBI were waiting when the plane, with
224 passengers and a crew of nine, arrived about 8:15 p.m in New
York. The three men were arrested without incident, Brown said.
   ``They intended no harm to anyone, there was no threat of
violence,'' said James Fox, director of the FBI's New York office.
``They just said they wanted to leave Haiti for New York City.''
   The men were identified as Edouine Noel, 24; Nicolas Mormil, 23;
and Jean Charlston Beinamie, 23, said FBI spokesman Chris Favo. All
three were taken to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower
Manhattan pending a hearing Monday on their request for asylum, he
said.
   They men were regular army personnel who did not want to be part
of the recent coup in Haiti, said Port Authority Detective William
Ahrens.
   American Airlines Flight 658 took off at 4:40 p.m. after the
three soldiers slipped under a wire fence that surrounds
Port-au-Prince International Airport and ran aboard the plane,
airport employees said.
   Radio Haiti Inter said the plane's captain agreed to fly the
three men to New York, the plane's destination. The station said
the men made no political statements.
   Eric Boucicault, director of American Airlines in Haiti, said
``three soldiers on duty entered at the end of the line of
passengers with a determined air. We could not refuse their
entrance. As a result of negotiation, they deposited all their
arms, pistols and rifles, in the pilot's cabin.
   ``Now they are seated calmly in their seats, and normal service
is being maintained,'' he said before the airplane landed in New
York.
   Flight 658 runs daily between New York and the capital city of
Port-au-Prince, where it arrives about 2 p.m. and leaves after 4
p.m.
   ``The pilot did a super job,'' said passenger Cameron Smith of
Boston. ``He negotiated a deal with them. He put them up in first
class and tended to them the rest of the way.''
   Other passengers were not immediately let off the plane as
authorities questioned them. The approximately 200 people who were
waiting for the flight's arrival said they were not told about the
incident until the plane landed.
   ``They were pointing M-16's already cocked,'' said the Rev.
Eugene Bryant, a Brooklyn minister who performed missionary work in
Haiti. ``It was all in French. We were just watching.''
   Many people refused to give their names for fear of retaliation
by the new Haitian regime.
   ``I went there for two weeks. It was the scariest two weeks of
my life,'' said one woman passenger, declining to give her name.
``I thought I was going to get a break, but the plane ride was no
break.''
   Haiti has been beset by turmoil in recent weeks.
   A Sept. 17 coup by lower-ranking soldiers led to the ouster of
Lt. Gen. Henry Namphy. Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril was installed as
president and the coup triggered a huge military uprising that led
to the ouster of military commanders loyal to Namphy and the
Duvalier family dictatorship that preceded him.

<TEXT>     Brig. Gen. Raul Cedras told the nation in an 11 p.m. broadcast that the
military had assumed control after a day of violence that claimed at least 26
lives and apparently ended the first democratic government in Haiti's nearly
two centuries as a nation.;   "Today, the armed forces find themselves
obligated to assume the heavy responsibility to keep the ship of state
afloat," Cedras said.;   "After seven months . . . of democratic experience,
the country once again finds itself a prey to the horrors of uncertainty. With
all Haitians . . . we will bring the ship to port.";   The takeover began with
mutinies at an army base and a police station Sunday night. Rebel elements
fired on Aristide's private residence at daybreak and on his entourage as it
later headed to the National Palace.;   The soldiers later seized the palace
and captured Aristide. His foreign minister, Jean-Robert Sabalat, said the
president was taken to army headquarters. Diplomatic sources said Venezuelan,
French and U.S. officials negotiated with the coup plotters to save the
president's life.;   A powerful sector of Haiti's 7,000-member army long has
opposed the leftist policies of Aristide, a 38-year-old Roman Catholic priest
who drew much of his popularity from the impoverished masses of the nation of
6 million. The leaders in Monday's coup attempt said Aristide was interfering
in army affairs.;   At least 26 people were killed and 200 wounded as Aristide
loyalists battled soldiers. The sounds of gunfire continued late into the
night.;   U.S. condemns coup; The United States and Canada condemned the coup
and demanded Aristide's release. The Organization of American States and the
U.N. Security Council convened in late-night sessions.;   About 2,000 Haitian
residents of New York held a raucous rally outside the U.N. building.;   The
uprising occurred five days after Aristide addressed the U.N. General Assembly
in his first trip to the United States since becoming president of this
coup-prone Caribbean nation. He said at the time that he was certain Haiti had
left the dark days of dictatorship behind.;   Among those killed when the
unrest first flared Sunday night was Sylvio Claude, an evangelical preacher
and two-time presidential candidate.;   Claude, 57, was set upon by a mob in
the southern provincial town of Cayes as he was leaving a political meeting
Sunday night. Assailants burned him in the streets, according to Radio
Antilles, an independent station.;   Hours after word surfaced in Miami's
Little Haiti section of Aristide's capture, protests broke out on city
streets, and demonstrators burned a U.S. flag, tires and other debris in
mounds in the street. A patrol car was set afire, police said.;   Haiti's
international airport closed Monday afternoon.;   At home during first attack;
Aristide had been at home with aides and a bodyguard at the time of the first
attack, the government said.;   Independent Radio Cacique said an armored
personnel carrier was attacked when it went to Aristide's home to take him to
the National Palace from his residence in La Plaine, six miles from
Port-au-Prince.;   The trouble began Sunday night with mutinies at an army
training camp at Freres, just outside Port-au-Prince, and at an army-run
police station in the downtown area of the capital.;   The U.S. Embassy in a
statement condemned the "outrageous attack against President Aristide by a
mutinous sector of the army.";   Aristide had been scheduled to pay a call on
President Bush next week in the Oval Office, said an official traveling with
Bush on a campaign trip in New Orleans.;   Aristide has moved since the first
day of his administration to reform the notoriously corrupt army, historically
an agent of repression in Haiti.;   Upon assuming office, he replaced generals
from the Army High Command with younger officers more inclined toward
democratic reform, but he had not made the appointments permanent.;  
Dissident soldiers said Aristide had been withholding permanent assignment to
ensure that the generals remained under his control.;   Bodies in the streets;
Dead bodies lay in the streets and slum areas ringing Port-au-Prince, the
capital city of 1 million.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Critics Denounce Namphy's Revocation Of Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Critics said Saturday that Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy's decision to discard the constitution approved 15
months ago demonstrates that the army has no intention of returning
the country to democracy.
   ``The army is sick of this talk of democracy. The truth is they
don't want elections,'' said Paul Latortue, a former senatorial
candidate in Haiti who lives in exile in Puerto Rico.
   Namphy said Friday night on state television that the existing
constitution included ``elements foreign to Haitian tradition'' and
was ``unhappily written and ratified in a climate of passion and
emotion.'' He said a new constitution would be written ``taking
Haitian reality into account.''
   ``We are experiencing a catastrophe,'' said Louis Roy, co-author
of the constitution and its most prominent defender. ``The entire
army and its commander-in-chief, Namphy, have committed perjury.
They swore allegiance to the constitution a year ago in spite of
the faults that they find in it now.''
   In a June 19 coup, Namphy ousted President Leslie Manigat, a
political science professor who was elected four months earlier and
is now in exile.
   Namphy ruled Haiti between the fall of dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier in February 1986 and Manigat's inauguration two years
later. The military officer repeatedly pledged to respect the
constitution, approved by 99 percent of Haitians in a March 1987
referendum.
   Among the guests invited to listen to Namphy's speech Friday at
his palace in Port-au-Prince were former presidential candidates
Gerard Phillipe-Auguste, who was Manigat's agriculture Minister,
and Gregoire Eugene, now Namphy's adviser on constitutional law.
   Also present were two former Duvalier aides, Claude Raymond and
Clovis Desinor, and the entire army High Command, including Col.
Jean-Claude Paul, recently indicted in Miami on charges of drug
trafficking.
   ``It was a comic and pathetic gathering Friday night at the
palace,'' said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a prominent opposition leader.
   ``A gang of dinosaurs have emerged from their caves to reassure
each other that their treasure would not be threatened by several
million human beings on the way to the polls to vote,'' said Bajeux.
   In January, Manigat was declared the winner of army-organized
elections boycotted by most Haitians.
   When asked to comment on Namphy's allegation that the
constitution was inspired by foreign ideas and was contrary to
Haitian tradition, Latortue said, ``He is saying returning exiles
bring undersirable ideas of change. I think Namphy regretted the
decision to open the door to exiles after Duvalier left.''
Meanwhile, at the end of a four-day summit of Caribbean Community
leaders in Antigua, Trinidad-Tobago Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson
criticized the organization for not condemning Namphy.
   ``I have no doubt whatsoever from the history of Gen. Namphy
that he has no commitment to the democratic process,'' Robinson
said.
   Streets were quiet in Port-au-Prince on Saturday and business
and public transportation functioned normally.
   ``It is obviously illusory to think of the full enjoyment of
rights and liberties in the context of absolute poverty in which
nearly 70 percent of the population ... is vegetating,'' Namphy
said in his speech.
   But he said his government would respect freedom of speech and
assembly and the right to participate in labor unions and political
parties.
   Latortue said Namphy's action pushes Haiti even farther away
from democratic rule. ``The army and the Duvalierists never liked
the constitution. They want an authoritarian regime. I see the path
to democracy as blocked,'' he said.
   The army has directly or indirectly ruled this impoverished
Caribbean nation for most of its 184-year history.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Former President Leslie Manigat
urged the world Tuesday to shun the soldiers who threw him out of
office, but opposition politicians called him an opportunist and
said they were glad he was gone.
   One opposition leader suggested negotiations with Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy, who proclaimed himself president on Monday.
   As night fell on a calm capital late Tuesday, there was concern
among relatives of some members of the Manigat government who were
arrested during the coup.
   ``We only hope they come back as soon as possible,'' said
Francois Savain. His father, Roger Savain, was information minister
and Francois' brother, Roger Jr., was a close friend of Manigat.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the two Savains, former Information Ministry officials Rodney
Marcellus and Jean Narces Lescouflair, and Manigat Cabinet chief
Lionel Desgranges were arrested. The source didn't know whether the
five remained in custody Tuesday.
   Capt. Isidor Pignon, commander of Fort Dimanche where political
prisoners are usually taken, angrily refused to tell The Associated
Press whether the Manigat aides were there.
   Few other people in this impoverished city seemed upset by the
events that ended Manigat's 4-month-old civilian government and
brought back Namphy, who had run the country for two years after
the Duvalier dictatorship ended.
   ``The message is clear: Haitians have been mocked for too long
by their governments. The people are not concerned because they
never accepted Manigat. This has been an affair at the top,'' said
the Rev. Antoine Adrien, a liberal Roman Catholic priest and
advocate of democracy.
   A sociologist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said:
``Manigat by words alone wanted to maintain the illusion of
democracy. One puff of the army's bad breath blew it away.''
   In Washington, the State Department said the United States would
maintain relations with the new government and work toward
democracy through diplomacy, not sanctions. ``There is no break in
the diplomatic relations; we're not contemplating it,'' spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said.
   Manigat is in the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean
island of Hispaniola with Haiti. He told reporters he had been
urging foreign governments and international organizations to
isolate the military government Namphy set up.
   ``My government represented the only and final chance for
democracy,'' Manigat said. ``The other democratic sectors have
understood that too late and it was their political mistake to
refuse the public support that would have strengthened my
government.''
   Manigat, a 57-year-old former political science professor,
called the new regime ``very fragile.'' He said the coup was the
result of corruption in the military.
   He said he did not know what role was played in the coup or
subsequent events by Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who has been indicted
on drug trafficking charges by a federal court in Miami.
   ``Namphy always acted on his own,'' Manigat said, adding that he
had faith in Paul as a loyal military man.
   Manigat sided with Paul last week by overruling Namphy's order
ending the colonel's command of the 700-man Dessalines Battalion,
whose barracks is just behind the National Palace.
   Manigat dismissed Namphy and confined him to his home, but loyal
officers freed him late Sunday.
   Paul, however, was at Namphy's side Monday when the 55-year-old
general waved an Uzi submachine gun on television and announced his
military government. Namphy restored Paul to his command and the
7,000-man Haitian army appears united.
   No injuries or deaths have been reported in the coup. Sporadic
shooting was heard in Port-au-Prince overnight but no casualties
were reported Tuesday. Gunfire at night is part of a tradition of
intimidation in Haiti.
   Opposition political leaders boycotted the Jan. 17 election,
which Manigat won with the army's help. Most expressed the belief
Tuesday that a new chance for democracy might follow his ouster.
   In Puerto Rico, where he lives in self-exile, Louis Dejoie II
urged a dialogue between Namphy and politicians.
   ``The only way to put the country back on track is to have free,
honest elections,'' said Dejoie, one of four leading presidential
candidates who refused to enter the Jan. 17 election. ``Manigat was
not viable nationally or internationally'' and ``tried to
double-cross the army the way he double-crossed the democratic
forces.''
   ``Namphy has no popularity,'' he said. ``I will wait and see
what the military government offers the people before judging them.
They can't govern forever with bayonets.''
   Haiti, the world's first black republic, won independence from
France in 1804 and has experienced dozens of coups and autocratic
regimes.
   Namphy led a military-civilian junta that ran Haiti after
President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Feb. 7, 1986, ending the
29-year dictatorship founded by his father, Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier. Namphy turned the government over to Manigat last Feb. 7.
   Namphy said he overthrew Manigat because the president betrayed
democracy and the constitution. Namphy and his army have made clear
they consider a good civilian government to be one that lets the
military keep its traditional role as the power behind the throne.

Lt-Gen Raoul Cedras, head of the military government in Haiti, resigned his
post yesterday and announced he was leaving the country, thus facilitating
the return of the man he overthrew in a bloody 1991 coup, President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Mr Aristide's supporters immediately took to the streets of the capital,
Port-au-Prince, to celebrate, forcing the US military to protect Gen Cedras
and his family, as well as Gen Jean-Claude Duperval, who was appointed
interim head of the Haitian military yesterday.
At a public ceremony on the steps of military headquarters, Gen Cedras
attempted to leave power in a dignified manner, handing over nominal control
of the armed forces and police to Gen Duperval, his second-in-command, as a
40-piece military band played the battle anthem of Haiti's armed forces.
But thousands of Aristide supporters turned the ceremony into a mockery,
singing anti-military songs to the band's tune. Chants of 'Aristide is
coming back, Cedras is going to eat sewage', and the noise of US military
helicopters overhead, drowned out much of the departing general's speech.
Gen Hugh Shelton, commander of the 17,000 US personnel on the ground in
Haiti, oversaw the ceremony, escorting Gen Cedras to the podium while US
troops kept screaming supporters of President Aristide at bay.
'I choose to leave the country because my presence could be a pretext for
unjustifiable acts,' Gen Cedras said.
There was no immediate announcement of which country would give him refuge,
but Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador at the UN, said last night the
general would move to an 'undisclosed South American country'. A US diplomat
ruled out Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Paraguay.
US officials also said they believed Gen Duperval would relinquish power to
President Aristide's nominee to head the military when the president made
his expected return on Saturday. Five Haitian colonels met the president
last week in Washington to discuss civilian control of the military.
The resignation followed two days of meetings with US officials, including
Mr William Perry, defence secretary, and Gen Shelton, in which Gen Cedras's
safety after he had stepped down and ways to deal improve the maintenance of
law and order in the country were discussed.
The general's authority over the military, and the military's reign of
terror over the population, had been steadily declining over the past week
as it became apparent that he had no future as commander.
Pro-Aristide demonstrations throughout the country have become widespread,
often with deadly consequences for the president's supporters.
On Friday in the town of St Marc, about 75km north of the capital, at least
10 people died and scores were injured as a bus ploughed into a pro-Aristide
rally. At the weekend, a similar incident occurred near Miragone, south of
the capital, killing 12.
Over the next few days, US forces will be under pressure to protect both
pro-Aristide rallies, sure to increase as the population prepares for the
return of its president, and members of the Haitian military, which is in
disarray but under unusual orders not to fire on Haitians.
Gen Cedras took power on September 30 1991, when his two leading associates
 -Brig-Gen Philippe Biamby and the police chief Lt-Col Michel Francois -
took President Aristide from his home and sent him into exile, first in
Venezuela and then in Washington.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A church leader today accused the
military government of undermining democratic reforms by ordering a
wave of arrests, beatings and the exile of political opponents.
   ``They have made rubbish of the constitution,'' said Roman
Catholic Bishop Willy Romelus on the church-run Radio Soleil. He
encouraged his listeners, however, to keep up their spirits.
   Of Haiti's six main radio stations, only Radio Soleil, the
Protestant Radio Lumiere and the state-run National Radio were
broadcasting news this morning under a state of siege declared by
military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. Radio is the main source of
news in the country.
   In its toughest crackdown on the opposition since taking power
in a September 1988 soldiers' revolt, the government arrested and
forced into exile seven prominent political activists during the
weekend. Dozens of others were arrested but were thought to have
been released.
   Port-au-Prince, the bustling capital of more than 1 million
people, remained calm. Shops and schools opened as usual and
traffic was normal.
   Critics said the crackdown indicates Avril intends to renege on
a promise to hold free elections in October.
   At a news conference Sunday in Miami, newly exiled activist
Hubert de Ronceray said Avril promised the elections only ``to get
help from foreign countries.''
   ``There's no possibility of a democracy with Mr. Avril. He's a
dictator,'' said the conservative leader.
   The state of siege was declared after an army colonel, his wife
and servants were killed Friday by unidentified gunmen just 100
yards from de Ronceray's home.
   De Ronceray, deported Saturday, claimed he was the intended
victim. Other opposition activists speculated Avril was using the
killings as a pretext to derail the transition to democracy he
promised after coming to power in a September 1988 soldiers' revolt.
   De Ronceray, 65, said that after his arrest he was kicked,
clubbed with guns, and had a cigarette jammed in his eye. The eye
was red as he spoke to reporters.
   The other exiles were also beaten before they were deported,
according to the activists and other sources.
   The government offered no comment on those reports.
   In Washington, the State Department condemned the state of siege
and arrests and urged the Haitian government to reiterate its
commitment to free elections. The United States suspended $60
million in aid to the impoverished country after Haiti's last
attempt at democratic elections was thwarted by armed thugs aided
by soldiers who massacred voters in 1987.
   Louis Roy, a prominent civic leader and an author of Haiti's
1987 constitution, ``was carrying a small suitcase, kissed the
ground two times and mounted the stairway to exile,'' a relative
told The Associated Press.
   Roy, 74, founder of the Haitian Red Cross, flew aboard a
commercial flight to Miami. ``I was hit in both ears and full in
the face in front of the duty officer at the police headquarters,''
he said upon arrival.
   Max Bourjolly, second-in-command of the Haitian Communist party,
was arrested at his home and exiled, apparently to France, said
party leader Rene Theodore.
   Family members and sources who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the others exiled Sunday were Aby Brun of the center-left
Congress for Democratic Movement, Sylvain Jolibois of the small
radical Jean-Jacques Dessalines Group, and radical activists Michel
Legros and Max Montreuil.
   They said Brun was flown to Miami and the others to the
Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola
with Haiti.
   Popular radical leader Sylvio Claude of the Haitian Christian
Democratic Party and Gerard Philippe-Auguste, head of the Movement
to Organize the Country party, went into hiding.
   De Ronceray and Roy are not new to exile. They spent several
years in Montreal during the rule of the late dictator Francois
``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, whose son continued the 29-year family
dynasty until fleeing to France in 1986 after a popular uprising.
   In announcing the state of siege Saturday night, the government
suspended a law forbidding forced exile and renewed an entry visa
requirement for Haitians returning from abroad.
   De Ronceray claimed the colonel killed near his house, Andre
Neptune, was shot by attackers sent out to kill him. He said he had
changed his own schedule because of a warning Avril wanted him
``destroyed,'' and the officer was slain while in a car similar to
his.
   Human rights activist Jean-Claude Bajeux, who arrived in Puerto
Rico from Haiti on Friday, said he suspected either army rivals or
the drug mafia were behind the slayings.
   ``The coincidence is significant. For this killing to happen now
and they immediately use it to round up (opposition leaders), it's
a typically Duvalierist scheme.''
   He was referring to the network of Duvalier supporters left in
this former French colony, where 80 percent of the 5 million people
live in poverty.
   Paul Latortue, a Haitian economist at the University of Puerto
Rico, said the weekend crackdown indicates Avril ``has allied
himself with the Duvalierists,'' whom he accused of killing Neptune.
   ``The government will now either show its teeth and demonstrate
there'll be no elections, or have elections without the
opposition's participation, with controlled candidates,'' Latortue
said.
   Avril rose to power in a revolt that ousted Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy, who oversaw the November 1987 elections that were canceled
when at least 34 voters were shot and hacked to death by thugs in
collusion with soldiers.
   Less than two months later, Namphy staged army-run elections
that were widely boycotted by voters and denounced by most foreign
observers as fraudulent. Several months later, he took back control
of the government.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The military government of Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril said Saturday that loyal troops crushed a mutiny
after two days of fighting and that most of the rebel soldiers were
captured.
   ``The soldiers of the Presidential Guard presently occupy the
Dessalines Barracks,'' said a statement issued by the army
adjutant, Gen. Andre Jean-Pierre, and read on state-run radio.
   It said most of the rebels in the barracks were captured but
some fled and left behind their uniforms and weapons.
   The communique did not say how many rebels were captured or had
escaped. The normal force of the Dessalines Barracks is 750
soldiers.
   Loyal soldiers shelled the barracks Friday night and resumed the
artillery bombardment Saturday morning. There also were firefights
in the area of the barracks, which adjoin the National Palace in
the center of Port-au-Prince.
   Casualty figures for Saturday's fighting were not available.
   A source close to the government said 17 soldiers, all thought
to be rebels, were killed in Friday's fighting. Haitians monitoring
military radio broadcasts said reports indicated the Presidential
Guard suffered 15 casualties but there was no breakdown of dead and
wounded.
   The state hospital said at least one civilian was killed Friday
and unconfirmed reports put the civilian death toll at three.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said it was believed two
Presidential Guard soldiers were killed Saturday.
   ``The casualty figures apparently are going to be lower than the
level of noise might have indicated,'' she said.
   Port-au-Prince remained calm after the government claimed
victory.
   Its communique said the captured rebels implicated drug
traffickers in efforts to overthrow Avril that began April 2 with
an attempted coup. It said an anti-government plot was organized by
Haitian exiles formerly associated with the ousted regime of
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier.
   The statement also claimed the mastermind of the revolt was
former Interior Minister Roger Lafontant, who is now living in the
Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti.
   The statement was issued at 5:15 p.m. EDT after several hours of
heavy shelling of the barracks. Shooting had tapered off shortly
before the announcement.
   U.S. officials said earlier that a hole was blown in the roof of
the gleaming white National Palace, which serves as the
presidential residence.
   It was believed the damage was caused by a mortar shell fired
about a mile away by rebels who fled the barracks Friday night and
took over a Roman Catholic church compound.
   Diplomats had said Friday night it appeared Avril's troops had
gained the upper hand and driven the rebels from the compound. But
fierce firefights broke out again Saturday.
   Reports Saturday morning said members of the Leopards commando
unit who had been involved in the mutiny were seen removing their
uniforms. Witnesses said they abandoned their base in the capital's
suburbs.
   There were no reports of fighting elsewhere in Haiti.
   The rebels accuse Avril's government, which took power in a
military coup six months ago, of favoritism toward the Presidential
Guard in pay and living conditions. They also said the government
was arbitrarily dismissing senior officers in a U.S.-supported
crackdown on drugs and corruption.
   In the attempted coup on April 2, rebel soldiers seized Avril
and took him to the airport for deportation but he was rescued by
loyalist soldiers.
   Avril went on television Monday to claim the rebellion had been
put down. However, rebel soldiers continued to roam the capital,
clashing with government forces.
   Avril, 50, came to power in September 1988 in a coup by
non-commissioned officers that ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. The
officers demanded democratic reform and an end to state-sponsored
violence.
   Namphy had deposed a short-lived civilian government. He had
earlier led a junta that took over after Jean-Claude Duvalier was
swept from power in a popular uprising and fled to France in
February 1986.
   The government blamed the attempted coup earlier this month on
people opposed to both democratic change and a ``campaign against
drug trafficking, contraband and corruption.''
   The United States has made the drug crackdown a condition for
restoring $70 million in aid that it suspended after thugs
massacred 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting Haiti's first free
elections in more than 30 years.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government said it foiled an
attempt Sunday to overthrow Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, and U.S.
officials said loyal troops apparently rescued Avril as he was
being driven away to be deported.
   Avril told the nation early Monday in a televised address that
rebel soldiers ``blinded by their exorbitant ambition'' attempted
to overthrow his government and appealed to Haitians to support his
leadership.
   He did not provide details of attempted coup or say how it was
foiled. There were no reports of casualties.
   A government communique read earlier over state-run television
said ``certain officers besieged'' the presidential palace ``and
attempted to overthrow the government.''
   Presidential guardsmen told journalists Avril was taken captive
at his mansion in Canape Verte, a wealthy neighborhood in the hills
overlooking the capital, as he returned home from a party early
Sunday.
   Sources said four military officers had tried to overthrow
Avril, who assumed power six months ago in this impoverished
Caribbean country's second coup in less than a year.
   In his 10-minute speech, Avril said: ``At a time when the
government is doing its utmost to ensure democratic progress and
economic recovery, once again the stability of the Haitian nation
was threatened.''
   He was flanked by at least a dozen soldiers dressed in battle
gear, including Sgt. Major Joseph Heubreux, who led the coup by
noncommissioned officers who put Avril in power last September.
   ``On the night of April 1 and 2, some members of the armed
forces blinded by their exorbitant ambitions attempted to overthrow
the government which I assumed Sept. 17 1988 as commander and chief
of the armed forces and president of the military government,''
Avril said.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said earlier that reports
indicated the coup attempt occurred about 4 a.m. and that Avril was
detained for a time.
   ``But it appears that when he was being taken to the airport to
be deported ... members of the presidential guard arrived at the
airport and escorted him back to the palace to be president
again,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   She said the attempted coup was ``totally bloodless.''
   However, Radio Liberte quoted an unidentified soldier as
Port-au-Prince would be ``set on fire'' unless the government
released one of the alleged coup leaders, identified by the soldier
as Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the Leopards battalion
commando unit.
   Military sources said Rebu was under military guard at the
National Palace.
   Loyal soldiers told journalists that Avril's wife, Marie-Ange,
and her mother were taken captive with Avril but released a couple
hours later.
   They also said two of Avril's brothers and Interior Minister
Col. Acedius St. Louis and his son were seized by the rebels.
   Avril's son, brothers and St. Louis and his son reportedly were
freed after two tanks rolled into the Leopards' barracks and
negotiated their release Sunday night. There were no reports of
casualties.
   Initial reports had said the army commander, Maj. Gen. Herard
Abraham, was among the coup leaders. But later accounts said that
was not correct and that the plot collapsed when Abraham refused
the rebels' offer of the presidency.
   Abraham was foreign minister under the government of Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, who Avril replaced.
   The attempt came four days after the discharge of four top army
officers accused of drug trafficking.
   Unconfirmed reports said four army officers planned the coup,
including Gen. Guy Francois, commander of the Dessalines barracks
in Port-au-Prince, which is the base of the most feared unit in
Haiti's 7,000-man army. The reports said all four officers had been
detained, but there was no confirmation.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Dennis Harter said the
situation in Haiti ``remains fluid.''
   Haiti's international airport was closed and large numbers of
soldiers were at the palace and on the streets, which were calm.
   Gunfire was heard twice near the palace in the pre-dawn hours.
Several hours later there was another spurt of gunfire in the same
area.
   Five soldiers of the Presidential Guard arrived at independent
radio station Liberte at 11:45 a.m. and read a statement denying
Avril was ousted.
   ``There has not been any visible reaction from the people,'' Ms.
Clyde said. ``The streets are very calm. People are going about
their business as usual.''
   Richard Melton, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for
Caribbean affairs, visited Haiti last Monday and told Avril
resumption of U.S. aid depended in part on Haiti's efforts to crack
down on the narcotics trade.
   On Wednesday, four top army officers accunvolvement in
the drug trade were discharged.
ay, a conservative political leader, said those
dismissals mighriggered the coup attempt.
   Leslie Manigat, Haiti's last civ president, was elected in
violence-marred elections in January replaced a junta led
by Namphy that had governed since dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier
fled to exile in France 9-year family
dictatorship.
   Namphy then overthrew Manigat in a coup June 20, 1988. On Sept.
17, Avril came to power in a coup.
   Two weeks ago, Avril partly restored constitutional rights
suspended in 1987. He also appointed a mostly civilian Cabinet and
agreed to the establit of an electoral council to prepare for
free elections.
   But there was widssatisfaction over the pace of his
reforms, and human rights groups accused the of
continuing repression.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Rebellious soldiers wound down
their purge of repressive army commanders Thursday but continued
hunting henchmen of the deposed Duvalier dynasty, independent radio
reports said.
   The new military government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril appealed
for an end to the lawlessness that began over the weekend, when a
coup toppled Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and sent him into exile in the
neighboring Dominican Republic.
   A military communique carried on state television said: ``Formal
instructions have been passed on to the forces of order to arrest
all individuals committing acts of brigandage and pillaging.'' It
said violators would be ``duly tried and punished.''
   The army announced retirements or discharges of 29 officers,
most of whom were removed by rebellious soldiers.
   Radio Metropole, meanwhile, said staff at the army general
headquarters issued a 16-point declaration demanding elections,
higher pay, medical benefits, subsidized housing and commissary
privileges.
   It appeared the unit was speaking for itself, although their
demands reflected sentiments expressed earlier by enlisted men who
carried out the coup Saturday night.
   Radio Haiti Inter reported that soldiers hunted for members of
the Tonton Macoutes, who have long terrorized the population.
   The Tonton Macoutes were the dreaded private army of Francois
Duvalier's regime and that of his son, Jean-Claude. The 29-year
Duvalier dictatorship ended when the younger Duvalier was forced
into exile in February 1986.
   Avril, the former army adjutant, assumed the presidency early
Sunday.
   Since then, rank-and-file soldiers nationwide have revolted
against their commanders, depositing them handcuffed outside army
headquarters in Port-au-Prince, the capital.
   Radio Haiti Inter reported the ouster Thursday of two more
commanders _ in southwestern Cotes de Fer and the northern port of
St. Marc. That brought to 21 the number of commanders who served
under Namphy known to have been forcibly removed.
   Capt. Ernst Ravix, commander of the 40-man St. Marc barracks and
reputed Macoutes sympathizer, was ousted one day after soldiers
fired on demonstrators there, killing a 12-year-old boy and
wounding three people. The Cotes de Fer commander was not
identified.
   Radio Haiti Inter said that after Ravix was arrested and brought
to Port-au-Prince, soldiers launched a hunt for Tonton Macoutes.
   The High Command on Thursday night announced the retirement of
26 officers and the discharge of three others, most of them already
forced from command.
   Gerard Desmangles, head of the Commerce Ministry, was removed by
underlings. Tele-Haiti said the asssistant minister of immigration
also was removed by lower-ranking personnel, but his name was not
reported.
   Bernard Degraff, the government's assistant director of
information, said removal of unpopular officers was proceeding
peacefully.
   ``The ouster movement should cease very soon,'' Degraff said.
``Loss of control ... is still possible, but I have seen an
improvement in the situation.''
   Sporadic nighttime gunfire continued and there were reports of
more reprisal attacks, but for the most part the capital was calm
Thursday. Namphy's country retreat in Foret des Pins outside
Port-au-Prince was among the houses reported pillaged.
   ``What is happening now could mean the possible elimination of
Macoutism,'' Jean-Claude Bajeux, a leading human rights activist
and a center-left opposition leader.
   ``Now we can construct democracy. Soldiers are asking for
justice, law and order under the 1987 constitution.''
   Namphy suspended the constitution, which was approved by 99
percent of the voters in a referendum in March 1987.
   Avril said democracy was ``the ultimate goal of the military.''
On Monday he named a new Cabinet of 11 civilians and one military
man, but has never mentioned restoration of the constitution or
elections.
   Dr. Louis Roy, founder of the Haitian Red Cross and co-author of
the 1987 constitution, said he thought the political situation
remained dangerously unsettled.
   He said the purge of Macoutes under way now should have happened
when Jean-Claude Duvalier was overthrown.
   ``Macoutes were not punished then; they were encouraged by the
government,'' he said.
   Namphy headed a junta that promised a transition to democracy.
However, independently run general elections Nov. 29 were thwarted
when armed thugs supported by soldiers killed at least 33 people at
polling stations.
   Leslie Manigat, a civilian, was elected president in January in
military-run balloting that was boycotted by leading presidential
candidates amd marred by widespread irregularities. Namphy ousted
him in June.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The opposition said Sunday it
believes the military will yield power to a civilian-led
government, but it threatened a general strike if ousted ruler Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril stays in Haiti.
   At least 24 people had been killed in the seven days of protests
and clashes that have left the government of this Caribbean nation
in turmoil. Haiti remained under interim military control Sunday,
the day after Avril's resignation.
   Soldiers firing from a speeding truck killed five people Sunday,
radio report said. Elsewhere in the capital, news photographers
said they saw police officers fatally shoot a young passer-by on a
street and then prevent witnesses from trying to save his life.
   The state hospital reported treating 100 people, mostly for
gunshot wounds, over the past two days.
   Opposition politicians, meanwhile, sought guarantees from a
caretaker administration that there would be a transition to
democratic rule with early elections for a civilian government.
   Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, has been
ruled mainly by force of arms since it gained independence from
France in 1804, and it would be the first time in its history that
the civilian opposition has ruled.
   Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, the army chief of staff, assumed
control after Avril stepped down Saturday. He promised to yield
power within 72 hours to a panel led by a civilian president that
would organize elections for October.
   Avril, 52, was said to be at his home in suburban
Port-au-Prince. Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of
anonymity said Avril might leave the country in a matter of days.
   Unity Assembly, a coalition of 11 opposition parties and one
civic group that was influential in Avril's downfall, had
threatened an ``unlimited total paralysis of the country'' unless
Avril resigned by Monday.
   At a news conference Sunday, the group issued a statement
expressing confidence that Abraham would give up power.
   However, it called Avril a ``public danger'' and said it would
not lift the strike call until the ousted leader left Haiti.
   ``The French and U.S. embassies say the matter of Avril's
departure is settled, but only popular pressure will force him
out,'' said business leader Antoine Izmery, a Unity Assembly member.
   Avril agreed to step down after negotiations reportedly
involving the U.S. and French embassies, the Roman Catholic Church
and opposition political parties.
   He had been in power 18 months. His resignation marked the
Caribbean nation's fifth change of government since February 1986,
when Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled into exile in France
and ended the 29-year dictatorship of the Duvalier family.
   Thousands of people streamed into the streets Saturday to
celebrate Avril's downfall, but scattered violence soon broke out.
Roving gangs of youths reportedly ransacked the homes of at least
three prominent sympathizers of the Avril and Duvalier regimes.
   Early Sunday, soldiers in a speeding pickup truck opened fire on
pedestrians in downtown Port-au-Prince, killing five people, and
then removed the bodies, independent Radio Metropole said.
   Later, the radio station said Army Maj. Renaud St. Bert was
killed in a lottery booth in the suburb of Delmas. The report gave
no details of the killing but said soldiers fired into the air to
disperse a crowd there.
   Four people reportedly were killed last week in clashes with
security forces. Radio reports Saturday said soldiers killed eight
youths who attacked the home of a special police agent in suburban
Port-au-Prince.
   Opposition politicians complained of the violence in the
capital. They called for neighborhood self-defense groups to
protect people from marauding gunmen.
   The opposition was at odds with the army over who would be named
provisional president.
   The army's choice was Supreme Court President Gilbert Austin,
63, who said Saturday he expected to be appointed. Austin was
appointed chief justice by Avril last year after serving as the
general's justice minister.
   But Unity Assembly rejected him Sunday. It believes he has been
too much under Avril's influence. The group has favored the court's
vice president, Gabriel Volcy, but he is 74 and ill.
   The new president is to appoint a Cabinet approved by an
11-member advisory council made up of representatives of the Roman
Catholic Church, civic, human rights and opposition groups, and one
member of the army.
   United Assembly did not name an alternative choice for
president. But conservative politician Gerard Philippe-Auguste
said: ``Our first priority is a new provisional head of state. We
don't have a government yet. When we do, we will tackle the problem
of elections.''
   Speculation that Avril might be on his way out began growing
Monday after a soldier killed an 11-year-old girl, apparently
accidentally during a demonstration. The killing set off violent
anti-government protests across the country.
   Avril came to power in September 1988 in a coup by
non-commissioned officers. He promised to hand over power to a
civilian government after elections in October. But critics said a
brutal crackdown in January on government critics made clear that
Avril intended instead to make himself a dictator.
   After Jean-Claude Duvalier went into exile in 1986, he was
replaced by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, Duvalier's army chief of staff
and Avril's predecessor.
   A first election attempt in November 1987 was called off after
thugs killed at least 34 voters. In January 1988, Leslie Manigat, a
university professor, was elected president, but most opposition
leaders refused to participate. Five months later, Namphy deposed
him.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril left Haiti
today aboard a U.S. Air Force transport plane, two days after the
military ruler was driven from power by widespread unrest.
   The deposed leader and his family arrived this morning at
Homestead Air Force Base, 25 miles south of Miami, the State
Department said. An Air Force spokesman in Washington, Lt. Col.
Darrell Hayes, said Avril was being driven to Boca Raton, Fla.,
after which he was ``on his own.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused comment on
whether the United States had granted Avril asylum but said: ``We
are hopeful for a smooth transition to democracy in Haiti and are
encouraging that effort.''
   After Avril left, the opposition coalition known as the Unity
Assembly reportedly picked Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the only woman
on the 12-member Supreme Court, as its choice for provisional
president.
   The army's choice is Supreme Court president Gilbert Austin, but
he has been rejected by the coalition as too close to Avril. The
deadline for announcing a provisional president is Tuesday, when
Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, who took over from Avril, is to transfer
power to a civilian.
   The new president will serve until an election is held.
   Thousands of people milled about Port-au-Prince, the capital,
but the mood was more one of disbelief than celebration.
   ``He's gone, he's gone,'' people were heard saying.
   The Rev. Bertrand Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest and staunch
critic of the military government, said residents should remain
alert to the possibility of army reprisals.
   ``We can smile, but we can't laugh yet,'' Aristide said on Radio
Haiti Inter after Avril's departure.
   At least 24 people were killed in seven days of protests and
clashes that have left this Caribbean nation without a leader and
in turmoil. Most of the victims have been civilians slain by
soldiers or police.
   ``The people have shown how much they love democracy by dying
for it,'' Aristide said earlier.
   A leading member of the Unity Assembly, Jean-Claude Roy, said
Ms. Pascal-Trouillot was the coalition's choice for provisional
president. Radio reports said Austin _ under the constitution next
in line for the presidency _ resigned from the court to make way
for Ms. Pascal-Trouillot.
   A widower, Ms. Pascal-Trouillot was Haiti's first woman judge
and is an author. Her best-known book, written in 1973, was ``The
Judicial Status of Haitian Women in Social Legislation.''
   If she is chosen as provisional president she would be the first
woman to hold the post in Haiti's history.
   Earlier, residents of the capital retreated behind shuttered
windows after sundown Sunday and the streets were deserted.
Soldiers in pickup trucks drove around the city and gunshots were
heard occasionally.
   ``I'm afraid for my husband and I fear the Macoutes will come
out of the walls,'' said the wife of a well-known politician,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The Tonton Macoutes were the
feared secret police of the Duvalier family, which ruled Haiti for
29 years.
   Numbering about 30,000, the Macoutes were disbanded after
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in February 1986.
Later, several hundred were integrated into the army and police as
special agents.
   Tele-Haiti, a private television station, urged viewers to stay
indoors Sunday night because ``there are gangs of marauding gunmen
in the streets'' and politicians and religious leaders urged
citizens to form neighborhood defense groups.
   The state hospital said it treated about 100 people, mostly for
gunshot wounds, over the weekend. Radio reports said soldiers
firing from a speeding truck killed five pedestrians on Sunday.
   In another incident, witnesses said police looking for the
killers of Maj. Renaud St. Bert stopped a passer-by, shot him four
times and sat under a tree for more than an hour watching him die.
   Avril was brought to power in a September 1988 revolt by
soldiers who professed disdain for political killings and other
abuses by the previous military ruler, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Namphy had ruled the country _ among the poorest in the
hemisphere _ for most of the 2{ years since the popular uprising
that ousted Jeane-Claude Duvalier.
   This Caribbean nation of 6 million people has been ruled mainly
by the military since it gained independence from France in 1804,
and opposition leaders said they did not trust Avril to oversee
presidential elections he promised for the fall. In a January
crackdown, the government jailed and beat dozens of dissidents,
exiling seven.
   Protests against Avril broke out one week ago after a soldier
killed an 11-year-old girl, apparently by accident.
   Avril agreed to step down after negotiations reportedly
involving the U.S. and French embassies, the Roman Catholic Church
and opposition political parties.
   In Haiti's last attempt at elections, overseen by Namphy in
November 1987, voting was canceled after thugs backed by soldiers
killed at least 34 voters.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Opposition leaders said Saturday
they were puzzled by President Leslie Manigat's abrupt dismissal of
his military chief, but they applauded the demonstration of
civilian authority over the armed forces.
   There were reports that the fired military commander, Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, was under house arrest.
   Namphy was president of the three-man junta that ruled Haiti
from the time dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in 1986
until Manigat was sworn in Feb. 7 following an election in January.
   A close associate of Namphy said the general is under house
arrest at his home in Bon Repos, 15 miles north of Port-au_Prince.
   The associate, speaking with the condition he not be identified,
told The Associated Press that ``some close friends went to see him
(Namphy) today. They were turned back. Nobody is allowed in or out.
The house is heavily guarded.''
   Youths chanting, ``Down with Manigat, long live the army!'' put
up tire barracades Friday night on the main east-west highway at
Petit Goave, about 30 miles west of the capital of Port-au-Prince.
   Soldiers dismantled the barricades Saturday and arrested one of
about 20 youths who began demonstrating in the town, Radio Haiti
Inter reported.
   Several rounds of gunfire were heard early Saturday from the
army barracks of Petionville, a suburb of the capital. Radio Haiti
Inter reported an explosion near the Champ de Mars Plaza, adjacent
to the presidential palace.
   There was no other information immediately available on the
gunshots or explosion.
   Businesses opened as usual in the capital, and streets were calm.
   ``Who knows what is really happening?'' asked Rev. Antoine
Adrien, a Roman Catholic priest and co-leader of the civic group
Honor and Respect for the Constitution.
   ``We were told Wednesday that the army and the executive were on
the best of terms, and now this bombshell,'' he said. ``We can only
rejoice if ... the military has submitted to civilian authority.''
   A presidential communique Friday night said Manigat had retired
Namphy and two other members of the general staff, Brig. Gens. Carl
Michel Nicolas and Wilthan Lherisson. Manigat promoted Col. Morton
Gousse to general and named him provisional military commander.
   The communique said the generals had defied Manigat's decision
Wednesday to rescind an order by Namphy transferring and retiring
several high-ranking officers.
   Among those Namphy attempted to transfer was Col. Jean-Claude
Paul, who was indicted for drug trafficking earlier this year by a
grand jury in Miami.
   Manigat, apparently siding with Paul, said the order was
unconstitutional because it was done without consulting him.
   ``The dismissal of Namphy seems to have enforced Manigat's
authority,'' said Sylvio Claude, leader of the opposition Christian
Democratic Party. ``But, politically, we must wait and see whether
Manigat can control the army he has apparently betrayed.''
   Paul commands the 700-man Dessalines Barracks, whose soldiers
were blamed for widespread violence against voters that left more
than 30 people dead and forced cancellation of independently
administered general elections Nov. 29.
   Manigat was declared the winner of Jan. 17 elections organized
by the junta. Manigat was considered the army's candidate in the
election.
   ``It is too soon to say whether there has been a reinforcement
of civilian authority over the military because in any case Manigat
must still make concessions to certain sectors of the army,'' said
Victor Benoit, co-leader of the leftist Congress of Democratic
Forces.
   It was unclear why Namphy ordered the transfer and whether the
order represented a power struggle within the army or was linked to
the U.S. charges against Paul, who has denied any wrongdoing.
   ``The Reagan administration asked Namphy to get rid of Paul. But
Manigat, it seems, has gotten rid of Namphy,'' Claude said.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Gerard Latortue called the removal ``a
strictly internal matter.''

<TEXT>     Western diplomats in Haiti estimated that as many as 350 civilians had died
in the insurrection.;   Radio Lumiere, one of several independent radio
stations that has managed to periodically broadcast from inside Haiti, said 30
to 40 supporters of Aristide were massacred Wednesday afternoon in a
Port-au-Prince slum.;   On the eve of the OAS delegation's arrival, the
normally teeming capital of 1 million was a virtual ghost town Thursday for
the fourth straight working day.;   Businesses closed; A few people wandered
the streets and soldiers stopped cars at checkpoints, searching for weapons.
Businesses were shut down, either out of fear or as part of a protest boycott
against Aristide's ouster.;   The airport remained closed to all but a few
charter flights of diplomats and journalists. There was no indication of when
commercial air service would be restored or commercial activity resumed.;   On
the fourth day since the army's takeover, diplomats on Thursday depicted
Cedras as being largely the captive of the ordinary soldiers who were
patrolling streets, commandeering cars, and threatening citizens.;   Diplomats
said there was no coherent chain of command in the country to rein in the
soldiers who were set against Aristide's return.;   In Washington, where he
lobbied for support on Capitol Hill before flying to New York to seek help
from the U.N. Security Council, Aristide referred to the coup leaders as "a
small gang trying to kill democracy." He was to meet with President Bush at
the White House this morning.;   Ready for evacuation; Meanwhile, hundreds of
U.S. troops remained poised to evacuate thousands of Americans if the
situation worsens in this impoverished Caribbean nation. At least 8,000
Americans have registered with the U.S. Embassy. Thousands more -- many of
them missionaries -- are believed to be scattered throughout countryside.;  
For the time being, the United States appeared to be ruling out military force
in favor of giving diplomatic pressure a chance to restore the 38-year-old
Aristide to the presidency.;   Secretary of State James Baker and other
diplomats attending an emergency 10-hour meeting late Wednesday of the
34-nation OAS in Washington hinted that force might be used if Aristide was
not reinstated. But the Bush administration played down that possibility on
Thursday.;   "We have absolutely no interest in using U.S. forces to in any
way interfere with the internal situation in Haiti," Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams said.;    OAS resolution; In its emergency session, the OAS adopted
an 11-point resolution urging its members to diplomatically and economically
isolate Haiti. Many nations, including the United States, have suspended all
aid to Haiti, one of the world's poorest countries.;   The resolution stopped
short of endorsing military action but said "all additional measures" would be
taken if peaceful efforts fail to restore Aristide.;   In Washington, the
Venezuelan Embassy confirmed a report that its army had been placed on alert
Thursday and told to prepare for a multinational military operation if
diplomatic efforts fail.  </TEXT>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers fired on student
demonstrators Friday and wounded at least three, radio accounts and
witnesses said, and reports surfaced that negotiations had begun
for Haiti's military ruler to resign.
   State TV Friday night said Avril had met with Army and church
leaders to negotiate peace but had no intention of leaving power
unless he is defeated in elections _ `not through disorder.''
   The protest by about 250 students came on the fourth day of
anti-government protests over the army's killing of an 11-year-old
girl.
   Political sources said opposition parties were negotiating with
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril and the army over his possible resignation
as leader of this impoverished Caribbean nation. ``Finally, after
four years of struggle, there is a real possibility to realize the
demands of Feb. 7, 1986'' _ the date dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier
fled into exile after a popular uprising, said Jean-Claude Bajeux,
a prominent political and human rights activist.
   A U.S. Embassy diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the United States was not involved in the talks.
   ``We are keeping in touch with them but we are in no way
involved with negotiations. We are not putting together a deal. It
is up to Haitians to decide if there's to be a change in
government,'' the diplomat said.
   A coalition of 11 opposition parties issued a statement Friday
calling on Haitians to stage ``an unlimited total paralysis of the
country'' if Avril does not step down by Monday.
   They said they proposed that Supreme Court Vice President
Gabriel Volcy act as provisional leader until elections are held.
The parties have repeatedly said they want Avril replaced for now
with a Supreme Court judge.
   Avril, who came to power in a soldiers' revolt in September
1988, has said he would be willing to step down if most Haitians
wanted him to, although he predicted that would lead to
``revolution and chaos.''
   But a high-ranking government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Friday that Avril has no intention of resigning
soon.
   ``Avril is ready to make concessions, but a hasty departure is
out of the question,'' he said.
   Late Friday, a commentator on state National Television said,
``The president has said he would leave if the will of the people
demand it, but the people's will can only be expressed through
elections and not through disorder.
   ``The president has taken all the measures necessary to provide
for free elections,'' the commentator said on the 10 p.m. news,
adding that Avril has met with members of the Army high command and
the Roman Catholic and Protestant church to negotiate peace.
   Demonstrations broke out Friday in the outskirts of
Port-au-Prince and continued until sundown. Protesters put up
barricades of burning tires and soldiers fired in the air to
disperse crowds.
   The capital was deserted Friday night but gunfire could be heard
downtown.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the U.S. Embassy in Port-Au-Prince received an unconfirmed
report that one of those injured Friday was a U.S. citizen.
   Radio Haiti Inter, an independent station, said at least three
people were wounded in Friday's shooting at a state university
campus a half-mile from the National Palace.
   Earlier Friday, hundreds of protesters, some hurling rocks,
blocked main roads in Port-au-Prince, bringing the capital of 1
million to a near-standstill with schools, stores and government
offices closed.
   Heavily armed soldiers milled around the entrance of the white
National Palace. Two anti-aircraft guns stood on the front lawn,
facing Champ de Mars Plaza.
   On John Brown Avenue, a main thoroughfare, soldiers and police
were seen climbing out of truck and clubbing youths standing by a
burning tire barricade.
   Radio stations said demonstrations also occurred Friday in the
northern port of Cap-Haitien, where soldiers fired tear gas to
scatter about 4,000 protesters, and in the western port of
Gonaives, where 500 students marched peacefully wearing black
armbands.
   Three people were killed Thursday, including a soldier beaten to
death by a mob, and at least 15 injured in countrywide
demonstrations, according to reports from radio stations, witnesses
and a doctor at the state hospital in Port-au-Prince.
   The protests were triggered by the killing Monday of schoolgirl
Rosaline Vaval by a soldier in a passing car in Petit Goave, about
30 miles west of the capital. Similar protests over the killing of
three high school students in 1985 led to Duvalier's downfall in
1986.
   Shooting broke out in Port-au-Prince Friday after soldiers and
police began a sweep of the city, dispersing crowds and arresting
protesters, radio stations said.
   Jerry Timmins, a reporter for the British Broadcasting Corp.,
said he saw soldiers pull up in a truck and fire on about 250
protesters at the state university's Human Sciences College.
   He said some soldiers fired into the air but others fired at
body level. The soldiers beat at least a dozen students, although
their demonstration had been peaceful, Timmins said.
   Timmins said a soldier fired at him, narrowly missing his head.
   On Thursday, about 3,000 people marched through Port-au-Prince
in a symbolic funeral for Miss Vaval.
   About 10,000 people attended her burial Thursday in Petit Goave.
That night, a mob rampaged through the town, burning an army
outpost, ransacking a government building and the mayor's house,
reported Radio Lumiere, a Protestant station.
   Mobs also were reported Thursday night in Gonaives, a resident
said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said that while the airport was reported open, some
airlines have temporarily suspended service to Haiti, which
occupies the western third of Hispaniola island.

FT  20 SEP 94 / US troops fly in to control Haiti: Signs of co-operation by
junta raise hopes for success of occupation mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
US troops yesterday spread out unopposed around Port-au-Prince, the Haitian
capital, after completing the first stage of a mission President Bill
Clinton defined as 'limited in time and scope'.
By last night 3,000 troops were expected to have arrived. Signs that Lt Gen
Raoul Cedras, the republic's military ruler, was co-operating with US
military commanders in ensuring an uncontested US landing fuelled hopes in
Washington for the success of the operation to restore democracy.
Retired general Colin Powell, previous head of the US joint chiefs of staff
and a key figure in the negotiating mission led by former US president Jimmy
Carter, said this was early evidence that the military junta was prepared to
live up to the letter of the agreement.
The deal between the US delegation and the Haitian military rulers was
reached at the last minute on Sunday night local time, as the first US
airborne invasion troops were on their way to Haiti from their bases. It
stipulated that the members of the junta would quit no later than October 15
and paved the way for what it is hoped will be a peaceful intervention in
Haiti by US forces.
The first US troops from the Tenth Mountain Division landed by helicopter
from the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower. US officials said 15,000 troops,
the maximum deployment envisaged, were expected to be in position by the end
of the week.
A succession of helicopters, followed by fixed-wing aircraft, swung low over
Port-au-Prince bay and skimmed over the tree tops into the civilian airport
north of the city.
Gen Hugh Shelton, commander of the US armed forces in Haiti, landed to
discuss with Gen Cedras the details of co-operation between the occupation
force and the Haitian military. He emerged from the meeting saying that 'the
Haitians are our friends'.
The general's emphasis on co-operation was echoed by US helicopters which
circled over the city with loudspeakers blaring in Creole, 'This is not an
invasion, we are here to work with the Haitian army. This is not an
invasion'.
In Port-au-Prince, the streets emptied during the day as people retreated to
their homes amid widespread anxiety about the US operation. However, by
early evening thousands of local people gathered at the port, lured by the
military spectacle and emboldened by the US presence. The crowd chanted
calls for the return of Fr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted as president in
the 1991 coup. They were chased away by Haitian police armed with clubs and
semi-automatic weapons.
In Washington, Mr Clinton stressed that the force's immediate mission was
'to make sure the leaders keep their word'. The president and members of the
US delegation acknowledged that the agreement placed the junta under no
obligation to leave the island.
This has caused open concern among advisers to Mr Aristide. Mr Randall
Robinson, the Washington human rights activist whose hunger strike this year
influenced US policies, said the agreement was 'terribly flawed'.
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, questioned why General Cedras
was 'allowed to stick around until October 15, maybe stay in the country and
maybe run for president next year'.
But Mr Clinton and Mr Carter pointed out at a joint press conference that
the Governor's Island agreement of July last year, also designed to ensure
the restoration of democratically elected government but never honoured by
the junta, would not have forced them into exile.
'I think they probably will leave - and should leave,' Mr Clinton said, 'but
this still has to be worked out by all the actors in the Haitian problem.'
The agreement was greeted with huge relief in Washington, where a fully
fledged invasion was widely opposed.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Rank-and-file soldiers who helped
oust Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and more than 50 of his military
commanders promised Monday to protect the rights of the poor.
   ``We are not only defending the enlisted men, we are speaking
for all the poor people,'' an unidentified soldier was quoted as
telling Radio Haiti Inter at army general headquarters in downtown
Port-au-Prince.
   ``People have the right to demonstrate, to express what's in
their hearts, as long as they do it peacefully,'' he said, adding
that soldiers would guarantee the safety of demonstrators.
   Another soldier said the 50 or more superior officers who have
been ousted by their troops since the Sept. 17 uprising against
Namphy will not be allowed to return to the army.
   ``We won't allow it,'' he said, adding that soldiers are still
demanding the ouster of more officers because of their unpopularity
or ties to the 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship.
   The soldiers were not identified by the radio station.
   Members of Namphy's Presidential Guard, led by 27-year-old Sgt.
Joseph Heubreux, said they ousted Namphy because they were
``sickened'' by his alleged collusion with thugs of the Duvalier
regime who massacred 13 parishioners and wounded more than 77
others people during a Mass on Sept. 11.
   The soldiers appointed Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril as the new
president.
   Also Monday, soldiers ordered the dismissal of the director of
the general post office, Jean Malette, after employees went on
strike demanding his ouster. Malette was replaced by Jean-Claude
Jean-Jacques, a managerial level employee.
   Employees of state agencies, following the example of Haiti's
7,000 soldiers, have ousted the unpopular directors of the state
flour mill, telephone company and water authority.
   Jacques Armand Charles, the new state prosecutor, was sworn in
Monday at the Palace of Justice, replacing Namphy-appointee
Mireille Zamor Pluviose.
   Meanwhile, Haiti Inter and Radio Metropole reported Monday that
former members of the Tonton Macoutes, the private army under the
Duvalier regime, killed three peasants who were protesting their
presence in Verrette, a village 60 miles north of the capital.
   The alleged Tonton Macoutes were accompanied by local police
Chief Dumarsais Charles, the radio stations reported.
   The regime begun by dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier in
1957 ended when his son, Jean-Claude, fled into exile in February
1986. Namphy took over as head of a three-man junta until Leslie
Manigat was elected president last January in balloting widely
thought to be fraudulent.
   Namphy ousted Manigat in a coup last June.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril, who rose to power 18 months ago in a revolt by pro-democracy
soldiers, resigned Saturday during a popular uprising against his
military regime.
   The embattled Haitian leader turned over power to Maj. Gen.
Herard Abraham, the army chief of staff, who said he would transfer
rule to a civilian-led government within 72 hours. Abraham said the
interim government would prepare for elections but did not give a
date.
   Diplomat sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Avril
would leave the country within two days. There was no word on where
he would go and how he would get there.
   Immediately after Avril's resignation, members of a coalition of
opposition parties disagreed over the provisions for Abraham's rule
and there also was discord over who would lead the civilian
government. The opposition members later met with Abraham and it
was not immediately known whether they reached agreement. They
scheduled a news conference for Sunday morning.
   It was Haiti's fifth change of government since February 1986,
when dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled the
impoverished Caribbean nation into exile in France.
   Avril's departure followed five days of mass protests. His
opponents said they no longer trusted him to usher in fair
elections that had been scheduled for October.
   Thousands of residents poured into the streets of the capital to
celebrate. Youths erected flaming tire barricades at major
intersections, and black smoke filled the sky over the capital.
   The television station Tele-Haiti said teen-agers shouted
slogans outside the house of a special police agent in the slum
suburb of Martissant, and that the agent and backers ``wildly''
opened fire, killing six. Radio Metropole said seven were killed.
   Sporadic gunfire was heard throughout the capital,
Port-au-Prince, and there were power outages in some neighborhoods.
   Independent Radio Metropole said the houses of some Duvalier and
Avril sympathizers had been ransacked and their cars burned. On
radio talk shows, callers demanded that Avril be thrown out of the
country.
   Abraham, in uniform, appeared on state television at 3:05 p.m.
EST to announce Avril's resignation.
   ``In light of the resignation of the military government of Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril, the armed forces of Haiti accept the heavy
task,'' Abraham said in French.
   ``The mission is clear and the objective is precise: to
re-establish peace and order within 72 hours so, in conformity with
the constitution, a provisional government can organize elections.''
   Abraham and the army want to give the interim presidency to
Supreme Court President Gilbert Austin, who had been appointed by
Avril as chief justice last year after serving as the general's
justice minister.
   However, the opposition coalition _ called the Unity Assembly _
said he would be a puppet of the army and that it wanted him to
resign as president of the high court.
   ``It is the president of the Supreme Court who, according to the
constitution, should be president,'' Austin said Saturday night.
   There had been speculation that 51-year-old Avril wanted to
return to his old job as army chief of staff. However, Tele-Haiti,
an independent television station, said he was retiring from the
army.
   Radio Metropole said Avril left the palace Saturday afternoon
and was at his private residence in the wealthy suburb of Canape
Vert, on the hills overlooking Port-au-Prince.
   Conservative leader Hubert De Ronceray, one of seven prominent
politicians forced into exile in a government crackdown in January,
said Avril's resignation was ``an encouraging first step.''
   ``But Prosper Avril is still a public danger if he stays in
Haiti,'' said De Ronceray, speaking by telephone from Miami.
   Another exile, Louis Roy, principal author of Haiti's 1987
constitution, said from the Caribbean island of Martinique that the
Haitian people had ``risen and overthrown a regime which had tried
to destroy its desire for a democratic form of government.''
   But, he added: ``It remains to be seen whether the army deserves
the confidence which has been placed in it.''
   In Washington, the Bush administration welcomed the promise by
Haiti's new leader to set the stage for national elections by
turning over power within 72 hours.
   The statement said the United States long has called for
improved human rights in Haiti and added: ``We obviously hope the
latest developments contribute to a realization of this objective.''
   Tele-Haiti said the interim president would be advised by an
11-member council representing civic groups, churches, the army and
eight provincial districts.
   Earlier, the opposition coalition had said it wanted Supreme
Court vice president Gabriel Volcy as the new provisional head. But
Antoine Izmery, a prominent businessman who belongs to the Unity
Assembly, said Volcy refused.
   He said ``it's an all-out war'' if Abraham remains in power for
72 hours.
   However, other political leaders were more conciliatory.
   Mark Bazin, an economist who leads a center-right party said he
was ``reassured about Abraham's good faith to play according to the
rules.'' He did not elaborate.
   Avril came to power in September 1988 in a coup by
non-commissioned officers. He promised to hand over power to a
civilian government after elections this fall. But critics said a
brutal crackdown in January on government critics made clear that
Avril intended to renege on that promise and make himself a
dictator.
   Speculation Avril might be on his way out began growing Monday
after a soldier killed an 11-year-old girl, apparently accidentally
during a demonstration. The killing set off a spate of violent
anti-government protests across the country that resulted in the
deaths of at least three people.
   Haiti, the poorest country in the hemisphere, has been ruled by
force of arms for most of its history since independence from
France in 1804.
   After Jean-Claude Duvalier went into exile in 1986, he was
replaced by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, Duvalier's army chief of staff.
He headed a three-man provisional junta that was to rule until
elections for a new government.
   The first election attempt in November 1987 was called off hours
into the vote after thugs killed at least 34 voters and confiscated
ballots. In January 1988, Leslie Manigat, a university professor,
was elected president. Few Haitians voted, and most opposition
leaders refused to participate.
   Five months later, Namphy entered the picture again. His troops
deposed Manigat, who had tried to fire Namphy. Avril replaced
Namphy in the coup of September 1988.
