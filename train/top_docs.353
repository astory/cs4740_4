   The Executive Council of the Modern Language Association
has noted with dismay the recent appearance of a number of
books and articles, including your May 3 and 23 editorials,
that decry "political correctness" on American campuses.
These texts charge that teachers of language and literature,
with the support of the MLA, are eliminating the classics of
Western civilization from the curriculum and making certain
attitudes toward race, class, gender, sexual orientation or
political affiliation the sole measure of a text's value.
Some teachers, it is said, intimidate colleagues who do not
comply with their own political agendas, and they subvert
reason, truth and artistic standards in order to impose crude
ideological dogmas on students. Normally, the MLA Executive
Council would not comment on the approaches members use in
their scholarly work or classrooms; however, recent
statements call for a response.
   The MLA, a century-old learned society, consists of almost
30,000 college and university scholars and teachers of the
modern languages and literature representing a wide spectrum
of histories, interests, scholarly methodologies and
approaches to teaching. In view of their great diversity, it
is unreasonable to suggest they are imposing a monolithic
ideology on the college curriculum. Over the past decade,
many have introduced new writers and raised new issues in
their courses, and there is a lively debate within the field
about the proper scope and focus of literary and language
studies. But this debate is scarcely unprecedented; it is an
extension of the legitimate process that has always made the
college curriculum in the U.S. responsive to the changing
interests of society and the changing shape of intellectual
disciplines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What is most disturbing in the attacks against the MLA and
individual members is the persistent resort to
misrepresentation and false labeling. While loudly invoking
rational debate, open discussion and responsible scholarship,
these attacks distort evidence and reduce complex issues to
slogans and name-calling. Further, they fail to acknowledge
the many differences in philosophical and other positions
represented among proponents for curricular change who,
whether or not one agrees with them, are raising important
questions about culture, language and society.
   Far from having discarded the established canon, most
teachers of literature and language continue to teach the
traditional works of Western culture, even as a growing
number introduce new or neglected works of Western and other
cultures. Instead of attacking traditional works on political
grounds, these teachers are re-enlivening the study of
literature and language by raising challenging questions from
new perspectives. Contrary to the charge that such questions
and perspectives debase standards, they have stimulated
students to think more critically, rigorously and creatively.
   Changes in what we teach our students have never been free
of controversy. In this context, it is useful to recall that
the Modern Language Association arose in 1883 precisely out
of such controversy -- the opposition to adding the teaching
of English and other modern languages and literatures to a
curriculum dominated by Greek and Latin. The teaching of
American literature, as distinct from English literature,
evolved after World War I out of a similar dispute, in which
many claimed that educational standards were being sacrificed
to popular taste. And 50 years ago there was strong
resistance to the introduction into literature classes of
writers such as Joyce, Woolf, Kafka, Garcia Lorca and
Faulkner.
   Literature has always been a theater of contention over
social, aesthetic and ethical values, and so has the study of
literature and language. Recent changes in our culture have
intensified these concerns in ways that need to be discussed
in a spirit of mutual respect. The Modern Language
Association will do everything it can to make the current
controversy -- at the moment so acrimonious -- fruitful and
genuinely educational.

<TEXT>
   In hopes of making Greeks more familiar
with their ancestors' ideas, the education minister has ordered
high school students to start taking daily classes in ancient Greek
in September.
   The decision by Education Minister Antonis Tritsis was reached
after months of public debate by scholars and educators, but some
teachers claim the language used by Homer, Plato and the great
Greek dramatists might confuse young students and be too hard for
them to learn.
   ``Ancient Greek ideas should have a living medium in the world
today,'' Tritsis said in an interview, ``and I think that living
medium is the Greek people who continue to speak the same language
as the ancient Greeks.''
   He added that high school students 13 to 18 years old will be
the first to take compulsory ancient Greek, but that eventually
6-year-olds will start learning the language through word-games.
   ``We want every young Greek to be directly familiar with the
great wealth of his ancestors and those ancient Greek works that
have influenced the world,'' said Tritsis, an American-trained
architect.
   European literature began with Homer's poems about the legendary
Greek heroes of the Trojan War, the ``Iliad'' and the ``Odyssey.''
   Plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides in the 5th century
B.C. are studied and performed in translation all over the world.
Plato's philosophic dialogues and Thucydides' histories contain
ideas that shaped Western thinking for centuries.
   Although Greek classical scholars and university professors say
they welcome Tritsis' project, schoolteachers protest that ancient
Greek is too difficult for all but the most talented linguists.
   While ancient Greek shares an alphabet and a wide range of
vocabulary with the present-day language, its grammar and structure
are much more complex.
   ``It is a fallacy that ancient Greek can be easily grasped by
every schoolchild,'' Christos Doukas, who heads the Athens-based
High School Teachers' Union, said in an interview.
   But Tritsis said Greek is a very conservative language. He
indicated it would be much less difficult for Greek students to
learn ancient Greek than it would be for American high school
students to learn Old English, which was spoken in England from
around 400 to 1100 A.D., or even the English of Chaucer and
Shakespeare.
   ``The difference in language between Shakespeare's English and
modern English or Chaucer and modern English is greater than that
between Homer and Heroditus and the Greek spoken today,'' he said.
``Despite changes in forms ... the vast amount of words and
expressions are the very same language we use today.''
   Junior high students now study ancient Greek literature during
four 45-minute classes a week. But they read texts that have been
translated into modern Greek.
   Tritsis wants students to begin reading the texts in ancient
Greek.
   High school students take a two-year basic course in ancient
Greek and read some of the original literature. However, they are
not examined on the ancient Greek texts. Tritsis wants those
studies continued at a higher level entirely in the original Greek.
   The students will continue their usual studies of modern Greek
and their two classes a week of either French or English.
   The teachers, however, argue that language lessons should focus
on modern Greek, which a difficult language to master but still
easier than ancient Greek.
   ``Learning ancient Greek from original texts will only confuse
schoolchildren,'' said Doukas of the teachers union. ``Instead we
should all spend more time and energy concentrating on the Greek we
speak today, itself a rich and expressive language.''
   In a major reform of the Greek school system in 1976, compulsory
ancient Greek was dropped from the state high school curriculum as
a ``dead'' language, irrelevant to modern educational needs.
   Now 15- and 16-year-old students intending to go to university
usually take a two-year basic course in ancient Greek, but scholars
say that isn't enough to keep the heritage alive.
   ``Ancient Greek has to be introduced at a much earlier stage in
a child's education, when it helps to develop his imagination,
judgment and memory,'' said Constantine Trypanis, a former culture
minister and retired Oxford University professor of Byzantine and
Modern Greek Studies.
   ``The study of ancient Greek language and literature in the
original is of cardinal importance if that tradition of culture is
to survive.''

<HL> 'Western Culture Must Go' </HL>
<AUTHOR> Bernard Lewis </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   This demand has been made of late by significant groups of students at Stanford and elsewhere, with increasing support from professors, politicians and others. 
It is not always clear whether what must go is Western culture itself, or merely its teaching in the universities, but given the central role that Western culture assigns to universities in our life, the two may in the long run come to the same thing. 

   For those who wish to arrange its removal, it may be useful to attempt some definitions of what this Western culture means, and what its removal would involve. 
If Western culture does indeed go, a number of things would go with it and others would come in their place. 

   One consequence would be the restoration of slavery. 
The institution of slavery has existed in virtually all the societies known to human history, in Asia, Africa and pre-Columbian America as well as in the West. 
The only thing that is peculiar about the institution of Western slavery is its abolition. 
The West alone, by its own choice and action -- sometimes, as in America, after bitter struggle -- abolished slavery in its own lands, and procured its abolition in those other parts of the world where the West exercised power or influence. 
In some of these countries the abolition of legal chattel slavery is very recent and could easily be reversed. 

   The restoration of slavery would also facilitate the introduction of another almost universal non-Western institution: the harem. 
The idea that marriage should take place only between one man and one woman at a time, both being free and adult, is peculiarly Western and has its roots deep in the Western past -- in Greece, Rome and Christianity. 
Other cultures have agreed in allowing a man, if he can afford it, to marry multiple wives, to enjoy the sexual use of female slaves and to castrate selected male slaves for the policing of his domestic establishment. 
In addition to polygamy and concubinage, other non-Western practices that might accompany this change could include child marriage and the burning of widows. 

   Changes of this magnitude would obviously arouse some opposition, even resistance. 
This, however, could easily be overcome by the removal of another of the peculiar and distinctive features of Western culture, namely political freedom. 
The idea that ordinary people have the right to share in the formation and conduct of government, and to criticize and seek to change the policies of those in power, is again peculiar to the Western cultural tradition and has Western roots going back to the American and French revolutions, the rise of the English Parliament, and the Greek city. 
The replacement of this outworn tradition by the natural and almost universal human combination of authority and submission would greatly ease the transition to a less parochially Western way of life. 

   Clearly, other cultures besides our own have art and music, philosophy and science, literature and life styles, the knowledge of which would benefit us and enrich our lives. 
But here we come to a dilemma. 

   Curiosity about other cultures, a willingness to learn their languages and study their ways, to appreciate and respect their achievements, all this again is peculiarly Western and relatively recent. 
The other great cultures of human history all have seen themselves as self-sufficient, and regarded the outsider -- or even the subculture insider -- with contempt, as barbarians, gentiles, untouchables, unbelievers, foreign devils, and the like. 
Only under the pressure of conquest and domination did they make the effort to learn the languages of other civilizations, and, in self-defense, to try to understand the ideas and ways of the current rulers of the world. 

   The West, in contrast, without constraint, developed an interest in other cultures, and made an effort to study them, to understand them and to enrich its own intellectual and cultural life in the process. 
This curiosity remains peculiar to Western and Westernized cultures and is still regarded with bafflement and anger by those who neither share nor understand it. 

   And here lies the difficulty. 
If Western culture goes, this kind of curiosity goes too, and with it our chance of learning about and learning from other cultures. 
How could we then get out of the vicious circle?

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 22, IRNA -- Mostafa Mirsalim who 
received a vote of confidence from the Majlis as the new 
minister of culture and Islamic guidance earlier today, outlined 
his programs after President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani introduced 
him to the deputies. 
  Mirsalim thanked the leader of the Islamic revolution 
Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i and President Rafsanjani for their 
confidence in him and disclosed the western conspiracies against 
the Islamic Republic. 
  He underlined the importance of the Islamic culture for the 
Iranian nation and said today's world is faced with the 
domination-seeking tendencies of certain heinous states who 
insist to score cultural supremacy through dominating over other 
nations so as to pave the way for pocketing more interests. 
  Underlining the extensive dimension of the cultural assault, 
he said that only last year, 40 European and American research 
centers have published 214 books and 300 articles on Iran and 
Islam while 16 counterrevolutionary and eight foreign radio 
stations broadcast programs in Persian. He added that 1,100 
counterrevolutionary t.v. stations also broadcast programs in 
Persian and 214 publishing centers of Iranians and non-Iranians 
abroad distributed 315 books in Persian in an effort to mock the 
Islamic values and to level accusations against Iran. 
  Giving more statistics, he also said that 310 cultural 
centers abroad were engaged in activities against the Persian 
and Islamic culture through publishing materials in 114 
periodicals in Persian while world's leading publications have 
published 110 articles on Iran and Islam. 
  Moreover, he added, eight world conferences were held on 
Iran 
during the period including the one on Iran-U.S. relations known 
as Clinton conference. 
  The minister underlined that cultural growth is more 
important than economic and social growth. Mirsalim noted that 
language is the main medium for transfer of cultural concepts 
and that he plans to make efforts towards "preserving and 
strengthening the eloquent Persian language while at the same 
time to refine the language of alien words." He added that 
efforts will also be made to promote Persian in other regions 
particluarly in Persian speaking countries. 
  As another domain of his plans, he said that he will protect 
the rights of the writers and artists and systematize cultural 
and research centers. 
  As far as cultural relations with foreign countries are 
concerned, he said that facilities would be provided for 
cultural cooperation with the Central Asian states while such 
cooperation with Pakistan and Afghanistan would be strengthened 
and cultural ties with the Persian Gulf littoral states would be 
continued.

CHINA'S NEWSPAPERS HEADLINE COMMUNISTS' TOP 40 SLOGANS

They aren't the catchiest slogans in the world, even in the original Chinese. 
But China's leading newspapers gave top-of-page-one display Sunday to 40 of 
them -- some new, some old -- selected to be official slogans of the 40th 
anniversary Oct. 1 of the founding of the People's Republic of China. 
</P>
<P>
It may be difficult even for the Communist Party ideologues who compiled the 
list to envision enthusiastic repetition of such slogans as: "Enhance socialist 
democratic and legal construction and consolidate and develop the stable and 
unified political situation!" 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every person in Beijing knows that China's top leadership, far from 
being stable or united, is rent by a fierce struggle over succession to 
85-year-old paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. That, in fact, is why claims of 
unity are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Almost no one, on the other hand, has any idea what "socialist democracy" 
means, if it means anything at all. "Legal construction" does at least have a 
meaning. It refers to China's attempt to gradually rely more on the rule of law 
and less on the whim of administrators and Communist Party bosses. Progress in 
this direction is spotty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neat Summary 
</P>
<P>
Despite their shortcomings, the slogans -- some simplistic, some bombastic, 
some contradictory -- give a neat summary of what preoccupies China's leaders 
today. They form a kind of snapshot of Communist Party policies as the People's 
Republic of China nears its 40th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The slogans reflect a recent shift toward more hard-line ideology, but most 
also address real problems. As in the case of references to stability and 
unity, however, the fact that a subject is embodied in a slogan usually means 
that it concerns an area where the government faces difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Near the top of the list is praise for the June 3-4 martial-law crackdown 
against pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, during which soldiers killed 
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of students and ordinary Beijing residents who 
poured into the streets in a vain attempt to block the army's advance. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Beijing, and of all China, now are supposed to rally behind the 
slogan: "Warmly hail the successful quelling of the turmoil and 
counterrevolutionary rebellion!" Or: "Salute the People's Liberation Army men, 
police and armed police who have performed remarkable feats in the struggle to 
defend the People's Republic." 
</P>
<P>
In a rebuttal to Western condemnation of the brutal June crackdown, people are 
urged: "Maintain the sovereignty of the country and national dignity and firmly 
oppose any foreign interference in China's internal affairs!" 
</P>
<P>
Other slogans reflect the ideological and political tensions inherent in 
government policies that aim to open China to the world and introduce market 
forces, while at the same time trying to maintain a political dictatorship and 
elements of central planning. 
</P>
<P>
"Adhere to the reform and open policies and accomplish the tasks of improving 
the economic environment, straightening out economic order and deepening 
reform," proclaims one slogan, which strings together a series of familiar 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Central Controls 
</P>
<P>
"Straightening out the economic order" is a reference to reassertion of some 
centralized controls to cope with problems such as corruption and inflation. 
The official line is that this will lay the groundwork for further 
market-oriented reforms, but China's most enthusiastic reformists and many 
Western analysts view this "straightening out" as actually being an attack on 
the reforms by hard-line advocates of central planning. 
</P>
<P>
On the ideological front, the people of China must "adhere to the Four Cardinal 
Principles" -- which require support for socialism and the dictatorship of the 
Communist Party -- and "firmly fight against bourgeois liberalization" -- a 
reference to the spread of Western concepts of democracy and civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, according to another slogan, China will "carry out the policy 
of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend." 
This slogan was introduced by the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung to encourage a 
period of intellectual liberalization in 1956, which was followed by the 
arrests of many critics. Since then, it has been repeatedly used during periods 
of relaxed political controls. 
</P>
<P>
Such periods, however, have always been followed by renewed crackdowns during 
which some of those who spoke their minds were punished. 
</P>
<P>
Some slogans stress the importance of education, science, culture and the role 
of intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
But in a throwback to the Maoist rhetoric of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, 
one slogan declares: "Wholeheartedly rely on the working class and consolidate 
and develop the worker-peasant alliance." 
</P>
<P>
The people of China also are to "enhance the construction of socialist ethics 
and be socialist citizens with ideals, morality, culture and discipline." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number of Recent Moves 
</P>
<P>
This stress on "socialist ethics" is reflected in a number of recent policy 
moves, including a decision reported Friday by the official New China News 
Agency requiring all high schools and colleges in Beijing to cooperate with 
factories "to have students perform regular manual labor." 
</P>
<P>
For many years, some schools have required students, as part of their 
ideological education, to spend time in workshops. Beijing authorities are now 
determined to expand the practice. Hard-line Communist Party leaders have 
repeatedly claimed that students who participated in this spring's 
pro-democracy protests were divorced from China's social realities. The 
performance of manual labor -- likely to be a few hours per week -- serves both 
as punishment and re-education. 
</P>
<P>
Rhetoric about tougher social and political discipline is also being paired 
with action. In the culmination of several years of preparation, a nationwide 
identity card system is to go into effect Friday, becoming a major new tool of 
authoritarian control. More than 570 million cards have been issued in the last 
few years, with more cards still due to be issued in some remote areas, 
according to Chinese press reports. Citizens over the age of 16 will be 
required to carry the cards at all times, the official China Daily reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Other slogans list a variety of additional tasks, none of them easy: a battle 
against government corruption, protection of the legal rights of women and 
children, population control, protection of the environment and the 
reunification of Nationalist-ruled Taiwan with the Chinese mainland.

   Are reformers still in the driver's seat in China? 
Or are Communist Party conservatives narrowing the country's eight-year-old economic and cultural opening to the outside world and putting a damper on free-market practices that have rejuvenated the centrally controlled economy? 

   The latest signs indicate that the pragmatists, led by Deng Xiaoping, China's preeminent leader, are still firmly behind the wheel. 
But the leadership's consensus for far-reaching economic reforms is showing cracks. 
And political reforms, meant to introduce a modicum of Western-style democracy, have been on the back burner as leaders stress the inviolability of the Communist dictatorship. 

   Almost all of Mr. Deng's economic reforms, especially those allowing substantial foreign investment and imported technology, remain intact. 
Observers here can't identify any leaders who would return to the ultraconservative (in China, that means leftist) ways of Mao Tse-tung, under whom China languished in isolation for almost three decades. 

   But the breakdown of Mr. Deng's carefully crafted plans for his own succession has set off a power struggle. 
His protege Hu Yaobang was forced to resign as Communist Party boss in mid-January because he failed to quell party intellectuals and student demonstrators who had questioned communism and praised capitalism. 
As groups within the leadership vie for a say in who will replace the 82-year-old Mr. Deng, the pace of economic reform has slowed. 

   That pace had been so fast that some party intellectuals had begun making speeches calling for a complete switchover to capitalism. 
Now all elements in the leadership, Mr. Deng included, seem bent on proving that they are firmly committed to the "socialist road." 
One result: a "struggle" against so-called bourgeois liberalization. 

   The campaign frightened many Chinese and foreigners here when it began at the time of Mr. Hu's ouster. 
It evoked visions of Mao's much-reviled Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
But Chinese and foreign observers are convinced, four months later, that the anti-Western, pro-party campaign is being strictly limited. 

   One recent clue came from China's Central Philharmonic Orchestra, which recently appeared on national TV wearing formal Western white ties and tails. 
In a country where the Mao jacket used to be de rigueur, comments an Asian diplomat here, "that's very symbolic." 

   China has sought to calm the fears through articles and reports in the official press and broadcast media and through a flood of public statements by Mr. Deng, Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang and other officials. 
"China can't afford any more upheavals and disturbances," says Mr. Deng. 
"Without opening up {to the outside world} and reform {of the economy} there will be no hope for the success of our country's modernization program." 

   At the same time, Mr. Deng tells any and all listeners that China will remain a socialist country with the Communist Party firmly in charge. 

   A year ago, China watchers were convinced that Mr. Deng was firmly in charge, and that even the most capitalist of the economic reforms then being bandied about would be carried out. 
But doubts about stability arose when small but well-publicized demonstrations in December by university students demanding more democracy had to be put down in several cities. 
Worries increased with the mid-January sacking of Mr. Hu. 

   Mr. Hu's forced retirement was accompanied by the start of the drive against bourgeois liberalization -- defined as Western ideas of democracy and anything else the party's conservatives find distasteful, even sexual allusions in fiction. 
It is also considered bourgeois liberalism to oppose the Communist Party. 
Several intellectuals were thrown out of the party and transferred from their jobs for questioning the party's supremacy. 

   But things have eased considerably since those dark days in December and January. 
Party leaders quickly began assuring every foreign visitor, including Secretary of State George Shultz, who visited in March, that the struggle against bourgeois liberalization would be confined to the party. 
Prime Minister Zhao, who took on the additional duties of party boss after Mr. Hu's ouster, has promised repeatedly that there will be no repetition of the extreme "leftist" practices of the Cultural Revolution. 
"There is no market for it," he told reporters. 
"All the {present} party and government leaders . . . were victims of the Great Cultural Revolution. 
Today, such a thing cannot get started anymore." 

   China's leaders also say that business relations with the outside world will be increased. 
And they pledge that economic reform within China will proceed after the experiences of the past eight years have been analyzed. 

   Economic reforms instituted in the past eight years, including the dismantling of Mao's farm collectives, have dramatically increased agricultural production and peasants' income. 
But grain and cotton production has slipped as farmers switched to more profitable crops, and irrigation systems have deteriorated as farmers spent their money on new homes, washing machines and color television sets. 

   The reforms in the cities, though major, have been less dramatic because they were introduced more recently. 
But dislocations occurred there, too, including a rush to build large capital projects and buy consumer goods, both of which ate into China's foreign-exchange reserves. 
An inefficient bureaucracy displeased foreign investors, slowing the flow of foreign capital needed to expand the economy. 

   Today the government is acting to make life easier for foreign investors, and that seems to have calmed early worries among diplomats and businessmen from abroad. 
"The changes weren't as earth-shaking as they feared might take place," says a European diplomat. 

   In any case, the political changes take second place, in businessmen's eyes, to economic problems that they have been facing all along -- including the foreign-exchange shortage, which has caused the Chinese to cut back on foreign orders and has put many contract negotiations on hold. 
A few minor contracts have been canceled. 

   "Westerners weren't all that wound up about the investment climate here anyway," says a diplomat. 
"Some were already deciding that it wasn't a good place to invest. 
The events of December and January just added to that uncertainty." 

   The amount of direct foreign investment in China last year fell by 48% from a year earlier. 
That, and frequent complaints by foreigners here, led the government to introduce 22 regulations last fall designed to answer some of the complaints. 
"I don't mean to suggest that, suddenly, China is an easy place to do business," says a U.S. trader, but since the 22 regulations were introduced, "it's easier." 
Still, he adds, "it's a tough year to make a direct sale." 
To make up foreign-exchange shortages, the Chinese have been holding imports down. 
The anti-Westernization drive also militates against imports that aren't used to increase production. 

   Other foreign observers here express concern that the new assertiveness of party conservatives will torpedo further implementation of some basic economic reforms that Western economists consider vital to China's economy. 
They most frequently mention price reform, which would let most prices float with supply and demand, and management reform, which would let skilled managers rather than Communist Party functionaries make factories' business and production decisions. 

   Under China's present system, prices of most nonfarm commodities are set by the state, and this leads to inefficiencies. 
Factories waste raw materials and energy, for example, because their cost is kept artificially low by the state. 

   Price reform is a complicated problem for the Chinese, who have a distaste for the inflation that would probably result. 
But observers feel that price reform must be imposed if management reform is to succeed. 
"Prices are a signal," says a foreign banker here. 
"If prices are distorted, then signals to factories are distorted." 

   Although economic reform seems generally on track, China watchers have been worried that political reform may be in trouble. 
"Economic reform isn't enough," says an Asian diplomat. 
"They have to raise the work ethic of the people." 
To do that, Mr. Deng last year proposed daring plans to reform the political structure, including separation of the roles of the Communist Party and the government and introduction of elements of grass-roots democracy. 

   Since the party hard-liners reasserted themselves in January, however, Mr. Deng and other leaders have been avoiding the subject. 
But just this week, in a move that diplomats interpreted as a sign of new confidence among the reformers, Prime Minister Zhao was quoted as saying that China needed liberal reforms to expand "people's democracy." 

   The status of intellectuals in the party is still unclear. 
"There is a determined effort to persuade intellectuals that they shouldn't fear too much out of the bourgeois liberalization campaign," says a European diplomat, but intellectuals remain wary. 
"Thought control is under way," the diplomat says. 
"They won't stick their necks out." 

   There also has been a clampdown on newspapers and magazines. 
Hundreds of unauthorized publications appear to have been closed, not because they were particularly political but because they printed cheap fiction and scandal. 
Editors say they have been cautioned to steer clear of controversial topics like political reform. 
Students are being kept under control with reminders that any political transgressions could land them a post-graduation assignment to the deserts of Xinjiang. 

   Even so, intellectual caution appears to be easing. 
Some intellectuals who halted their Western contacts after January have resumed them. 
One American reporter was surprised recently when a Chinese journalist suddenly phoned to chat after not having been heard from for months. 

   The campaign against bourgeois liberalization seems to have affected ordinary Chinese not at all. 
Western-style dance halls, even discos with rock music, still thrive. 
Beijing residents recently could attend at least three Western theatrical productions with Chinese casts: "The Music Man," "The Fantasticks" and "Our Town." 
And Beijing taxi drivers are as feisty as ever. 

   "The biggest problem with this country is the Communist Party," said one taxi driver, complaining that many party functionaries were corrupt. 
"The Communist Party is like a big tree -- but the roots are rotten." 

   Outsiders are sometimes astonished to hear such talk. 
"The Chinese are surprisingly interested in talking about what's going on, and amazingly they speak their mind," says a Chinese-speaking American businessman here. 
"I can get in a taxi and get a pretty rip-roaring conversation going about the system. 
They say there are lots of problems, that the anti-bourgeois-liberalization campaign means nothing, that it's boring, and that the leaders are too old."

<HL> 3,000 Days of Ayatollah Khomeini
---
By Khosrow Fatemi</HL>
<DD> 04/30/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> MDEST </IN>
<TEXT>
   The Islamic Republic of Iran is 3,000 days old today. 
It was established on Feb. 11, 1979, a month after the shah left the country and two weeks after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from 15 years in exile. 
These 3,000 days have brought much suffering to Iranians, suffering that can be calculated in human, economic and sociopolitical terms. 

   The principal feature of the ayatollah's regime has been Iran's war with Iraq, which began in September 1980 and nearly seven years later shows no sign of ending. 
Although the war was started by Iraq, it is Ayatollah Khomeini's adamant opposition to a cease-fire or peace that has been the main cause of its prolongation. 
The ayatollah's approach to the war is to use antiquated military tactics such as human-wave attacks that result in a large number of casualties. 

   Most observers put the number of Iranian fatalities at 600,000 and the number of injuries at more than 1.5 million. 
In other words, for each of its inglorious days, the Islamic Republic has cost Iran 200 lives and 500 injuries. 
These numbers reflect only the Iranian side of the conflict and do not include Iraqi casualties, which are estimated to be one-half of Iran's. 
Their inclusion would increase the daily toll of the ayatollah's war by 100 deaths and 250 injuries. 

   The human suffering perpetuated by the ayatollah is not limited to that brought about by his war with Iraq. 
The Islamic Republic has also been implicated in several terrorist attacks on Western embassies and commercial centers around the world. 
Included in this category are 292 U.S. Marines and tens of other Westerners killed by terrorists trained and financed by the ayatollah and his associates in diplomatic guise. 

   Estimates of the number of executions in Iran for the ayatollah's 3,000 days range from a few thousand by Amnesty International (which footnotes all its figures by saying that its estimates are understated because of lack of reporting) to more than 100,000, which is the number given by Iranian opposition groups abroad. 
My own research indicates a figure of about 60,000, which would average out to 20 executions a day. 

   Finally, since the 1979 revolution, more than two million Iranians have been made homeless by the war and forced into internal migration to other parts of the country. 
In addition, another 2.5 million Iranians, resentful of the ayatollah's drive to return Iran to medieval morality and intolerant of his tactics, have been forced into exile, mostly in Europe and the U.S. Every day of the Islamic Republic has forced 667 Iranians out of their homes and another 833 out of their homeland. 

   The ayatollah's government claims that the cost of the war to the Iranian economy has been more than $300 billion, or $100 million for each one of the Islamic Republic's troubling days. 
This is for a country with a gross national product of about $183 million a day. 
In other words, every day, the Islamic Republic wastes more than half of Iran's total production in its war with Iraq. 

   The gravity of the situation becomes even more apparent when these figures are combined with other economic problems that the ayatollah's government has created for Iran. 
Among them is the continuing recession. 
The country's GNP reached $67 billion in 1977 and has since remained at about that level in real terms, while the annual rate of inflation has averaged between 20% and 25%. 
Another economic offshoot of the ayatollah's regime is unemployment, which was close to zero at the time of the Islamic revolution but is currently estimated at between 30% and 40% of the total labor force. 
Underemployment is also a problem. 

   The ayatollah's only economic promise has been to reduce Iran's dependence on imports and oil exports. 
Yet, according to the International Monetary Fund, Iran's imports reached $15 billion in 1984 (the latest year for which data are available), compared with $14 billion in 1977, the last peaceful year of the shah's reign. 
The country's non-oil exports, which were more than $600 million in 1977, dwindled to less than $260 million out of a total of $13.2 billion in 1985, according to the IMF. 

   Another severe blow to the country's economic performance and development has been the emigration of more than 2.5 million Iranians since the start of the Islamic Republic. 
The impact of the shortage of human power is exemplified by the number of Iranian physicians at home and abroad. 
Before the Islamic revolution, there were 25,000 doctors in Iran for a population of 35 million -- that is, one doctor for 1,400 people. (By comparison, there is about one doctor for every 500 people in the U.S.) 
Today, there are 13,000 physicians for a population of 40 million, or one doctor for 3,077 people. 
Since the formation of the Islamic Republic, more than 15,000 doctors have emigrated, retired or died, and fewer than 3,000 new doctors have completed their studies because of the frequent closure of the universities. 

   Similar shortages exist in other professions, especially management and economics. 
There is also a shortage of university professors. 

   In sociopolitical terms, Ayatollah Khomeini has transformed the world's perception of Iran into that of a nation of terrorists and barbarians. 
Under his guidance, the Islamic Republic has replaced Iran's educational system with superstition and the teachings of the Middle Ages, converted Iranian women into second-class citizens, and brainwashed Iranian youths into martyring themselves in the ayatollah's "holy war" with Iraq. 
Moreover, the Islamic Republic has given a new meaning to political savagery and religious intolerance -- as Iranian Jews and Bahais can attest -- all in God's name. 

   While the ayatollah's regime may not have an overtly leftist orientation, through its alienation of the Iranian masses, it is paving the way for an eventual communization of Iran. 
A likely scenario is not a popular communist uprising but rather a coup by a small group of military officers capitalizing on the regime's unpopularity, followed by an appeal for help to the Soviet Union -- similar to what happened in Afghanistan in 1979. 
Moscow could use a 1921 treaty with Iran as a pretext to comply. 

   The West's naivete in such actions as the Reagan administration's secret dealings with the Islamic Republic lends credibility to the perception among many Iranians that the ayatollah is, in effect, kept in power by the West. 
These feelings are augmented by the Western world's willingness to support the ayatollah commercially. (West Germany and Japan provided Iran with 30% of its total imports in 1985.) 
All of this increases anti-Western sentiments not among the hooligans who are paid or brainwashed to shout "death to America" in front of Western TV cameras, but in the educated middle class. 

   While Iranian culture is antipathetic to communism, the longer the ayatollah stays in power, the more likely this will change. 
According to an old Persian proverb, "a drowning man clutches onto anything, including a useless piece of wood." 
In the not-too-distant future, communism may become Iran's useless piece of wood.

   Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin called for more
ideological education to shield young people from the influences of
Western culture, official media reported today.
   Jiang, at a meeting Friday on higher education also attended by
Premier Li Peng, said educators must take a clear stand against
``bourgeois liberalization'' in the wake of the student-led movement
for democratic reform.
   Meanwhile, staff at the Jianguo Hotel and several other
well-known Beijing hotels said officials from the China National
Publications Import and Export Corp., a state company, on Friday
removed all foreign magazines and newspapers from their stands.
   Several other hotels, including the Sheraton Great Wall, the
Holiday Inn and the Palace, also said foreign periodicals had been
confiscated. The hotels said the Chinese officials gave no reason
for confiscating the publications.
   Hotels are among the few places Chinese have access to foreign
news accounts of the crackdown on dissent in China, which have
differed greatly with the government's version. Satellite reception
of TV news from the United States, including CNN, were cut off at
several hotels earlier this month.
   On Friday, the official press reported the government was
planning a sweep on the nation's bookstores to removal publications
written by scholars wanted by police for participating in the
pro-democracy movement.
   The military crushed the movement in an attack on Beijing on June
3-4 after the government declared it had become a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' against the socialist system.
   Jiang, the party's general secretary, said the rebellion backed
up statements by senior leader Deng Xiaoping that China's most
serious fault in recent years was neglecting ideological education.
   ``Quite a number of young people have been greatly influenced by
Western culture and ideology in recent years, yet we have slackened
correct ideological education among them. As a result, they are not
mentally prepared to face the hardships and complexities in the
socialist construction and the reform,'' the official Xinhua News
Agency quoted him as saying.
   University students already have been told they will have
additional mandatory classes in ideology this fall. The Beijing
Daily reported this week that summer vacation programs have been
arranged for primary and middle school students to educate them in
loving the Communist Party, socialism, the motherland and the
People's Liberation Army.
   It said military officers will give lectures to children on the
rebellion and children will visit martial law troops and the
families of soldiers killed by protesters resisting their advance
into the city.
   Jiang also gave backhanded praise to intellectuals, who had
expressed support for the democratic movement.
   He said they were the ``gem of the nation'' but that
``intellectuals have their shortcomings and we should help them to
have a better understanding through education and studies.''
   He said dissident Fang Lizhi, who has sought refuge in the U.S.
Embassy and is wanted for purported counterrevolutionary crimes,
``and his like are scum of the Chinese intellectuals and very few in
number.''
   Jiang was appointed party chief on June 24 when the party purged
Zhao Ziyang, who had sympathized with some of the students' demands.
Zhao, stripped of all his party posts, has not been seen since May
19.
   Li Ruihuan, a member of the powerful Politburo Standing
Committee, noted that China's two latest bouts of bourgeois
liberalization, or flirtation with Western culture, began with
student demonstrations. The government also launched a campaign
against bourgeois liberalization after student demonstrations in the
winter of 1986-87.
   ``This fact poses a problem for us and we should make a thorough
study on how to run the schools well,'' he said.
   Also Friday, the U.S. Senate voted 81-10 to impose economic
sanctions on China and to urge President Bush to take even harsher
measures.
   The legislation, passed as an amendment to a pending State
Department appropriations bill, adopts several sanctions passed
earlier by the House. It requires Bush to suspend several trade
programs but gives him the flexibility to stop any program
suspension.
   The legislation includes six-month suspensions of trade insurance
by the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the use of U.S. funds
to support China trade.
   The Senate also adopted non-binding suggestions in which they
urged Bush to take stiffer steps, including reviewing all trade
agreements between the countries.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in Paris with Bush for a
summit of the seven leading industrial nations, said the
administration would consider the legislation but that the
president's current response to the crackdown has been appropriate.

   The current drive to include multicultural and non-Western
books in the core curriculum of American universities is
justified in its goals, but misguided in its approach.
   If pursued as a complement to study of the West, learning
about the achievements and failings of other societies can
help us better understand our own. The great works of
non-Western civilization, like those of Greece and Rome, can
broaden the minds of young people and sharpen their thinking.
There are practical reasons, too, for Americans who come from
increasingly diverse backgrounds and who will have to compete
in a global economy to learn about the languages and cultures
of non-European lands.

   Unfortunately, many institutions -- such as Mount Holyoke,
Dartmouth, Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin -- now
require students to take non-Western or ethnic studies but do
not require them to study the basic ingredients of Western
history, politics or literature. Meanwhile at universities
such as Stanford, which boast of an inclusive curriculum,
multicultural education has degenerated into the uncritical
depreciation of Western classics as racist, sexist and
homophobic, combined with ethnic cheerleading and primitive
chic when the subject is minority or Third World cultures.
   The following "great books" could be required as part of a
non-Western curriculum. They could be taught alongside a
similar sequence in Western classics, or the two sets of
works could be integrated into a single core. Obviously, this
outline does not exhaust the list of important works produced
in other cultures; it is intended to suggest the approach
that should guide serious advocates of multiculturalism:
   -- The Upanishads. Written in Sanskrit between 800 and 400
B.C., they represent sacred spiritual teaching for the
Hindus. The word "upanishad" means instruction at the foot of
a sage. There are more than a hundred upanishads, and of
them, the "Bhagavad-Gita" -- the lessons of life communicated
by Lord Krishna to the archer Arjun -- is undoubtedly the
most influential. The Upanishads teach that God is a sublime
force within us, enabling us to rise above our mortal
limitations. They have contributed to a widespread
conviction, across the Indian subcontinent, that it is a
waste of time to combat social injustice, as true liberation
comes from the inner soul's receptivity to the divine
calling.
   -- Confucius' "Analects." Compiled by his pupils soon
after the master's death in the 5th century B.C., Confucius'
teachings have become the foundation of Chinese thought. Like
Socrates, his rough contemporary, Confucius believed that men
should seek virtue for its own sake, rather than because it
promises a reward in this life or the next; he also shares
Socrates' view that the contemplative life is the highest
calling. Confucian life is dedicated to the relentless
pursuit of moral improvement, through refinement of such
character traits as courage and benevolence.
   Western students who study Confucius confront a worldview
that takes a fatalistic approach to reforming social
institutions, emphasizes unqualified obedience within the
family, and embraces rigid class structures and emperor
worship. A less pliant approach to political oppression may
be found in Mencius, whose doctrine of rulers existing for
the good of the people was ignored for most of Chinese
history.
   -- The Koran. The holy text of the Muslim religion,
accepted as the word of Allah communicated to the prophet
Mohammed in the 7th century, the Koran has much in common
with the Judeo-Christian tradition out of which it sprang.
Like the Old Testament, it is a rich combination of
common-sense advice, history, moral instruction and divine
law. The Koran outlines a vision of human dignity,
self-discipline and charity that has greatly improved the
lives of many of its followers. While the cruel and heartless
will be punished, the Koran promises: "Those who have faith
and do good works will be rewarded by gardens watered by
running streams."
   At the same time, its teachings regarding male superiority
and authority over women, polygamy, and criminal deterrence
("As for the man or woman who is guilty of theft, cut off
their hands, for this is the punishment enjoined by Allah")
will be difficult for many Westerners to embrace. The Koran
does not distinguish between religious and political
activity: It calls for Muslim domination and limited rights
for others, and it urges a jihad, or holy war, against
non-Islamic states to bring them under the rule of Allah.
   -- Lady Shikibu Murasaki's "Tale of Genji." Composed
during the 11th century, this is a vivid and opulent account
of Japanese life at court. Murasaki, who served as an aide to
the Empress Akiko, camouflaged her learning in Chinese and
Japanese language, as well as history, because she knew that
such knowledge was considered inappropriate for a woman. But
this erudition, as well as a fluent style, are evident in
"Tale of Genji," in which Murasaki herself is a character --
the second wife of Prince Genji.
   The work was well known in court circles during her time,
and the emperor upon reading it was amazed at Murasaki's
understanding of Japanese imperial history and convention.
"Tale of Genji" provides the patient student (it is a lengthy
novel of six parts) with a rare vista on the complex norms of
11th-century Japan.
   -- Rabindranath Tagore's "Gitanjali." Written in Bengali
in the early 20th century, this is a series of poetic
meditations on life and nature. William Butler Yeats, who
wrote the introduction to the English translation of the
"Gitanjali," said he discovered in Tagore a world that he had
always dreamed about, but never encountered, in the West.
   "These verses," Yeats wrote, "will not lie in little
well-printed books upon ladies' tables, who turn the pages
with indolent hands that they may sigh over a life without
meaning . . . but, as the generations pass, travelers will
hum them on the highway, and men rowing upon the rivers.
Lovers, while they await one another, shall find this love of
God a magic gulf wherein their own more bitter passion may
bathe and renew its youth." Somehow Tagore's spiritual ethos
managed to capture "a whole people, a whole civilization,"
and he did so grandly, nobly, without polemic.
   -- Chinua Achebe's "Things Fall Apart." The conflict
between the old tribal ways of Africa and the new forces of
colonialism and Christianity are portrayed in this 1958
novel. It dramatizes change through the life of a bellicose
tribesman of the Ibo tribe in Nigeria, who places such
emphasis on physical strength that he regards all men weaker
than himself as "women."
   Mr. Achebe's novel recounts the destruction of
thousand-year-old indigenous traditions, including
internecine warfare among the tribes (the protagonist Okonkwo
drinks wine from the skulls of rival tribesmen he has
killed), wife-beating, the consultation of oracles leading to
bloodshed, and superstitious refusals to bury those who die
from disease. "Things Fall Apart" is written with such
economy, honesty and moral seriousness that it has been
compared to the classics of Greek tragedy.
   -- Naguib Mahfouz's "The Thief and the Dogs." When Mr.
Mahfouz won the Nobel Prize in 1988 he was praised for being
realistic yet metaphorical, detailed yet evocative. In the
tradition of Flaubert and Dickens, Mr. Mahfouz is a masterly
observer of the subtle interaction of foreign and indigenous
influences in Cairo, and his novels reflect the rich social
texture of urban life: its distracting exotica; its
picaresque abandon; its social-climbing, kowtowing, and
disguised corruption. "The Thief and the Dogs," published in
1961, is a narrative thriller, following the roguish exploits
of the jewel robber Sai Mahran, his desperate attempts at
revenge and love, his moral disguise of revolutionary ideals
for his self-aggrandizing crimes, and ultimately his effort
to escape the police dogs without degrading himself to the
level of an animal. This novel raises the veil on an
often-concealed and often-misrepresented civilization.
   -- Octavio Paz's "The Labyrinth of Solitude." Published in
1985, this collection consists of two long meditations -- the
famous title piece and "The Other Mexico" -- and other
shorter articles, all exploring the moral and psychological
identity of Mexico, partly in relation with colonial Spain
and the U.S. Mr. Paz, who won the 1990 Nobel Prize for
literature, is a Mexican novelist, poet and social critic,
and this book employs flights of fancy, rhythm, and meter, as
well as trenchant analysis and commentary. Mr. Paz terms
himself a "disillusioned leftist," and his work resonates
with longing for a peasant utopia, punctuated by a keen
awareness of the follies that attend its implementation.
   Other classics that could be added to this list include
the "Tao Te Ching" of Lao-tse, Sun Tzu's "Art of War," the
"Ramayana," Ibn Khaldun's "Muqadimmah," the autobiography of
Al Ghazali, the Chinese drama "Three Kingdoms" by Lo
Kuan-Chung, and the "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam." Contemporary
works, such as Mario Vargas Llosa's "Against Wind and Tide,"
V.S. Naipaul's "A House for Mr. Biswas," the work of Jorge
Luis Borges, and the novels of Wole Soyinka, could be used as
well. Any multicultural curriculum should explore the
principles of Buddhism. There are also excellent collections
of folklore, historical surveys, and modern scholarly
analyses of the literature and philosophy of non-Western
cultures that merit study.
   Multiculturalism is bogus when it reduces scholarship to
ideology. Instead, universities should promote authentic
multiculturalism, which through a critical appraisal of both
Western and non-Western cultures promotes knowledge and
understanding among the peoples of America and of the world.

<HEAD>Colleges Losing Interest in Humanities, But The Public's Not</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colleges and universities are losing interest
in literature, language and history but Americans are showing a
``remarkable blossoming'' of interest in cultural events, spending
more money on them than on sports events, a government report says.
   The report by Lynne V. Cheney, chairwoman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities, says the high cost of education may
be causing more students to avoid liberal arts subjects in favor of
courses that will give them a money-making career.
   While the number of bachelor's degrees awarded increased 88
percent in the past two decades, degrees in the humanities dropped
33 percent, said her report released Sunday. Foreign language
majors were down 29 percent, English majors 33 percent, philosophy
majors 35 percent and history majors 43 percent, it said.
   The 73-page report ordered by Congress says too many colleges
are neglecting the achievements of Western culture while requiring
ethnic courses, treating literary masterpieces as political
documents, stressing publishing rather than teaching, and dealing
in topics so specialized that they have little meaning outside the
academic world.
   The report says museums, libraries, educational TV stations,
state humanities councils and private historical societies provide
so much education that they have become ``a kind of parallel
school,'' reaching millions of people outside college campuses.
   ``The remarkable blossoming of the humanities in the public
sphere is one of the least noted, though most important, cultural
developments of the last few decades,'' writes Mrs. Cheney.
   The $140 million endowment she has headed since May 1986
provides grants to scholars, colleges, museums, libraries and other
institutions to promote the humanities.
   Citing a variety of sources, the report gives several examples
of increased public interest in the humanities, including record
high book sales, a doubling of the number of historical
organizations in 20 years to nearly 10,000, and a 660 percent
increase in visitors to the National Gallery of Art in Washington
since 1957.
   Americans who spent twice as much on sports events as on
cultural endeavors 20 years ago are now spending more on culture _
$3.4 billion compared with $3.1 billion for sports in 1986, said a
news release accompanying the report. It gave no details on how the
figures were obtained or what cultural events were included.
   The report says that while some have argued that television is
the enemy of books, people are actually both watching television
and reading, with book sales up 400 percent since television was
rare 40 years ago.
   Mrs. Cheney credits television with increasing the sale of some
books which have been the basis for popular dramas or subjects of
discussion on educational television shows.
   In assessing the academic approach to the humanities, the report
says: ``Viewing humanities texts as though they were primarily
political documents is the most noticeable trend in academic study
of the humanities today. Truth and beauty and excellence are
regarded as irrelevant; questions of intellectual aesthetic
quality, dismissed.''
   The report says Western tradition is rich and creative, but many
colleges are abandoning courses that teach it.
   The report says a course in great Western literature is under
attack at Columbia University in New York, while Mount Holyoke
College in Massachusetts and the University of Wisconsin at Madison
require ethnic or Third World courses but have no Western
civilization requirements.
   ``The humanities are about more than politics, about more than
social power,'' the report says. ``What gives them their abiding
worth are truths that pass beyond time and circumstance; truths
that, transcending accidents of class, race, and gender, speak to
us all.''
   The report, ``Humanities in America,'' resulted from several
meetings of advisory panels and regional groups formed by the
endowment. It follows a 1986 report, ``American Memory,'' which
detailed how little high school students know about Western
history, literature and culture.

   Beijing University, survivor of invasions,
repression and political warfare, commemorates on Wednesday its
90th anniversary as China's foremost center of learning.
   The celebrations have been pegged not to the college's founding
date in 1898 but to a famous uprising on May 4, 1919, that vaulted
Beijing University students into the vanguard of China's
revolutionary and nationalist movements.
   The university marks its birthday with symposiums on its great
thinkers, publication of books chronicling the university's role in
shaping modern China, sports competition and disco and folk dancing.
   But as it enters its 10th decade, Beida, as it is known in its
abbreviated Chinese form, faces yet another crisis, a lack of money
that educators claim could seriously erode its standards of
excellence.
   ``We have many problems,'' said Huang Huaicheng, director of the
president's office. ``Facilities are quite backward and need to be
renovated. Students live six to a room. There are not enough
classrooms and the library is inadequate. We can't even buy all the
books we need.''
   Huang said the school last year had to cut corners to make up a
$1.3 million gap between planned spending and funds of $8.1 million
from the government and other sources.
   He said there's no money left to boost pay for instructors, who
start out at less than $30 a month, about the same as an unskilled
laborer, and seldom make more than $55.
   Most of China's 1,000 universities share the same financial
plight. The government, acknowledging that education has been
neglected in the past, is spending more, but must give priority to
lower education in a nation still 20 percent illiterate.
   The government now is encouraging teachers to help out colleges
and bolster their meager incomes by moonlighting. Universities are
being told to make money by selling basic services and technology.
   Beida students and faculty, living up to their activist
traditions, have been the first to question the wisdom of this
policy. Students with shoeshine kits appeared on Beijing's central
Tiananmen Square to show what they thought of sideline jobs.
   Open letters to members of China's parliament and big-character
posters on the campus recently spoke of the ``crisis'' engendered
by the government's investing in industrial development rather than
its human resources.
   ``Beida students have a tradition of being concerned about the
future of the country,'' Huang said.
   University President Ding Shisin defended the protestors and
complained to Chinese journalists that some department heads at the
university didn't even have their own offices.
   Beijing University began in 1898 as the Peking Imperial
University. It was founded during the Qing Dynasty's ``100-Day
Reform,'' a short-lived effort to introduce some Western ideas in
government and education.
   For its first two decades, the school's main role was to turn
out government functionaries, and among its less kind nicknames
were ``the gambling den'' and ``fountainhead of ribaldry and
bawdiness.''
   That changed in 1916 when Cai Yuanpei, a classical scholar who
had studied in Europe, became president. Cai introduced Western
scholarship and coed education and brought in educators such as
Chen Duxiu, one of the fathers of Chinese leftism, and Hu Shi, who
studied under American pragmatist John Dewey and led the movement
to use the vernacular language in Chinese literature.
   One of China's first Marxists, Li Dazhao, was librarian and then
professor at Beida. Among his library assistants was Mao Tse-tung.
   Beida and other Beijing universities moved to the southwest
China city of Kunming after Japanese troops invaded the capital in
1937, returning only in 1946 after World War II ended.
   Three years later Mao came to power in Beijing, bringing with
him strong anti-intellectual biases.
   In 1957, when Mao encouraged critics to speak out with the
slogan, ``Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of
thought contend,'' Beida teachers declared that ``the masses want
to overthrow the Communist Party.'' They were among the first to be
purged in a subsequent crackdown.
   Ma Yinzhu, an American-educated economist, was replaced as
president in 1960 and disappeared shortly after knocking government
policies in a magazine article where he said, ``It is not enough to
destroy; one must build.''
   The first clashes of the disastrous Cultural Revolution began at
Beida in 1966 when Nie Yuanzi, a woman in the philosophy department
backed by Mao's wife Jiang Qing, leveled attacks on university
President Lu Ping.
   In the next few years hundreds on the campus were detained,
driven to suicide or murdered in armed battles between rival
radical factions.
   For a decade almost all classes were suspended and no degrees
were given. ``The Cultural Revolution brought overall destruction
to the university,'' Huang said.
   He said entrance exams were revived in 1977. The school now
accepts about one out of five examinees. It has offered degrees
since 1981.
   The school now has 20,000 students, including post-graduates and
special students, with a freshman class of about 2,000. Since its
merger in 1952 with Yanjing University, a former American
missionary college, it has occupied 500 acres of wooded land in
northwest Beijing.
   Qing Dynasty-style buildings with red pillars and slanted, tiled
roofs and surrounded by bamboo groves and lakes are one throwback
to the Yanjing period.
   One fixture that will be missing at 90th anniversary
celebrations will be a giant statue of Mao, torn down late one
night in April by university workmen. Teachers who helped build the
monolith during the early days of the Cultural Revolution applauded
its removal, saying it was one reminder of the past they could live
without.

   Communist authorities are ordering China's
rambunctious students to sit through special summer school classes
geared toward ridding them of yearnings for democracy and a better
life for intellectuals.
   Official reports today said the government ordered universities
to use summer school to teach students to support state policies
and to ``enhance students' consciousness'' about the difficulties
of implementing them.
   In China, students every summer are sent for several weeks to
farms, factories and businesses to ``learn from the masses.''
   The People's Daily said this year's program would push the party
line.
   The order came down in a government directive, issued by the
Communist Party Propaganda Department, State Education Commission
and Communist Youth League. It appeared part of official efforts to
control China's restive college students and lessen their
widespread alienation from the party line.
   The directive came two weeks after students at Beijing
University put up dozens of posters demanding democracy and
criticizing the government's ongoing political and economic reforms
as inadequate.
   ``The directive expressed the hope that the students will be led
to the frontline of the reforms to understand the great
achievements of the past 10 years of reform and increase their
confidence in it,'' the People's Daily said.
   The Xinhua News Agency's English service said the students
``should be educated to support reform programs drawn up by the
party and the government and take part in overcoming difficulties
in the reform.''
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping launched the reform program in 1978
in an effort to develop China's backward economy by replacing
central planning with elements of free-market economies.
   He also sought to make the sluggish bureaucracy more efficient.
   Many students believe the reforms do not go far enough and want
sweeping political changes, including introduction of Western-style
democracy.
   The posters that went up this month at Beijing University took
pokes at top leaders and demanded democracy, respect for human
rights, a freer press, more funds for education and better pay for
intellectuals.
   Police appeared in force to head off a march students had
planned to dramatize their demands. Authorities warned against
illegal protests and emphasized the need for stability if China is
to modernize.
   The official China Daily today quoted the head of the party
Propaganda Department, Wang Renzhi, as telling a meeting of
ideological workers in Beijing they must be careful in exposing
students to foreign ideas.
   Wang said China must introduce foreign ideas that are good for
its development, but should not embrace all Western culture and
ideology. He especially warned against teaching nihilist, egoist
and non-rationalist philosophies.

IN THE MAY 4TH TRADITION, CHINESE STUDENTS SEEK A NEW TURNING POINT

The student demonstrations that erupted last month after the death of Hu 
Yaobang, who had become a symbol of democracy, are very much in the Chinese 
tradition. The first student demonstration in modern times occurred 70 years 
ago today. Then, as in April, Beijing University students marched from their 
campus to Tian An Men Square to demonstrate against the government and demand 
"democracy and science." April's rally put less emphasis on science, which the 
government already supports, and more emphasis on demands for freedom of 
speech, rule of law, end of corruption and student-led, rather than party-led, 
organizations and publications. 
</P>
<P>
The May 4th Movement became a turning point in Chinese history, leading to the 
overthrow of the warlord government and rejection of Confucian ideology, which 
had dominated China for more than 2,000 years. Whereas the May 4th Movement 
challenged Confucianism, 1989's demonstration challenged Marxism-Leninism and 
the Communist Party that have dominated since 1949. Like the May 4th Movement, 
the April demonstration was well-organized, starting in Beijing and spreading 
to universities throughout China. That the students were able to conduct their 
protests of more than 100,000, facing off against policemen and military men 
without any major incident, shows the degree of organizational skill that they 
must have learned from their party elders, the very people they have turned 
against. 
</P>
<P>
Like their May 4th predecessors, the students, following the demonstration, 
have boycotted classes and mobilized support to their cause from other groups 
-- the middle class, workers and peasants. In modern times, student movements 
have only been successful when they have gained wider social support. There is 
evidence that members of the emerging small-scale entrepreneurial class that 
has been spawned by Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms has helped the students 
morally and financially. Workers on fixed incomes who have been hurt by 
inflation, also caused by the reforms, have joined in the demonstrations, 
though their concerns are more economic than political. 
</P>
<P>
The May 4th Movement was able to take place and expand because the warlord 
government was relatively weak. By contrast, China's present government can act 
decisively if it wishes. It is ironic that one reason the party leaders purged 
Hu as the general secretary in January, 1987, was because he had refused to 
repress the student demonstrations for democracy in December, 1986. Yet the 
same leaders have showed restraint this time. 
</P>
<P>
In part, the leadership is divided and uncertain about what action to take. 
Accelerating inflation, blatant corruption of officials and their children and 
the people's general discontent have created a potentially explosive situation, 
which the leaders fear may erupt into chaos if they crack down. Moreover, the 
memory of repression and anarchy of the Cultural Revolution, in which these 
leaders were among the victims, also is a limiting factor. Perhaps most 
important, unlike the regimes of the warlords, Chiang Kai-shek and Mao 
Tse-tung, the Deng regime has been reluctant to use violent means to suppress 
political demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Another restraint is China's concern with its image in the outside world. 
During the Cultural Revolution, China did not care about its image abroad. But 
today it does because it wants foreign capital, technology and help with its 
modernization. It also cares about its image in the communist world, in which 
it sees itself in competition with the Soviet Union in developing the most 
effective model for reform. Although China has stressed economic rather than 
political reform, it too has accepted the need for the latter. A bloody 
repression of students demanding democracy at the very time Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's visit is imminent could be very embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
Both the May 4, 1919, and April, 1989, demonstrations occurred in a pluralistic 
intellectual atmosphere in which many ideas from abroad were vigorously and 
publicly debated. Many of the students' teachers and intellectual elders had 
written about and openly advocated the democratic rights for which the students 
demonstrated. In the two months preceding the April demonstration, nearly 100 
of China's most prominent intellectuals had success makes you feel pessimistic. 
It condemns you to loneliness and makes you feel apart from the world. Talking 
so much about my films sometimes makes me depressed. I think dwelling on your 
organized a petition to the government demanding the release of political 
prisoners and democratic rights. This was the first time since 1949 that 
intellectuals had organized publicly for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
An important difference, however, between the two movements, is that they took 
place in different contexts. The May 4th occurred two years after the Russian 
Revolution, when it appeared that the Bolsheviks with their Marxist-Leninist 
ideology had found a way to modernize a backward country quickly. Its model and 
ideology became the inspiration for many of the participants of the May 4th 
Movement -- among them Mao -- who were to establish the Chinese Communist Party 
and eventually lead it to power. 
</P>
<P>
The participants in the April demonstration specifically reject that model and 
ideology as a failure and as inappropriate. The models today are the Western 
democratic systems and the idea of human rights as evolved in the West. 
However, just as the Chinese transformed Buddhism or Marxism-Leninism brought 
in from abroad, whatever they take from abroad today will be combined with 
aspects of their own tradition and society. 
</P>
<P>
This year is also the 40th anniversary of the Chinese Communist revolution. 
Will 1989 mark a comparable turning point in Chinese history?

   Irving Kristol has gone too far ("The Tragedy of
Multiculturalism," editorial page, July 31). Pillorying the
broad range of attempts to respond to our growing cultural
diversity by invoking such excesses as teaching that
"`Western civilization' was invented by black Egyptians and
feloniously appropriated by the Greeks" is about as useful,
and serves the same purpose, as the Bush presidential
campaign's use of Willie Horton: manipulation of public
opinion through fear of change, rather than providing the
facts.
   The fact is that, racially and ethnically, America's
school-age population is increasingly unlike its past
generations. According to the 1990 census, 15% of today's
preschoolers are black, 13% Hispanic, 3% Asian and Pacific
Islander, 1% American Indian and 6% "other." Compare that
with Mr. Kristol's contemporaries (people aged 70 to 74 in
1990): 8% black, 3.6% Hispanic, 1.5% Asian and Pacific
Islander, 0.4% American Indian and 1% "other."

   Demographers have made much of the change from a majority
of families with children to a majority of families without
children. But that applies only to white families. Two-thirds
of black families have children under age 18, as do nearly
70% of Hispanics and 63% of "other" races. This ensures that
the school-age population will become even less a product of
"what we call `Western civilization'" in the future.
   It takes a high degree of obtuseness not to understand
that limiting the curriculum to "what we call `Western
civilization'" is a sure way to turn off a youth population
that is already largely alienated from school. A good example
of how their different backgrounds produce different
interests was provided by a study last year on awareness of
current news events. Most of the conclusions faulted the
younger generation for its ignorance of the Gorbachev-Bush
dialogue and the political changes in Eastern Europe -- and
failed to note that its interest in the freeing of Nelson
Mandela, the U.S. invasion of Panama and the political
upheaval in China was as great as that of older generations.

   I found Mr. Kristol's article very bold and accurate. I
recently graduated from one of the last bastions of a truly
classical liberal-arts education.
   But the "core curriculum," as it is known at my alma
mater, is under attack. This is not surprising, since most
schools across the country are also under fire. I am,
therefore, worried that if I have any children, they are
going to grow up without ever being exposed to (let alone
versed in) Homer, Aeschylus or Montaigne. Oh, by the way, I
am from Africa -- a real, greencard-carrying immigrant.
   There are thousands of Africans and other non-Americans
who would literally do anything for the privilege of being
"brainwashed" by studying Hobbes and Locke.
   Teodros Ashenafi

   First of all, multiculturalism is not an attempt to
address the social problems of African-Americans -- it is an
effort to correct the marginalization of significant
historical figures and events involving nonwhite people and
to portray history more accurately. Second, Latin Americans
and Asian-Americans have been equally involved in, and
concerned about, multicultural education. Third, Mr. Kristol
minimizes the impact of positive role models, contradicting
the declarations of social scientists concerning the
demonstrative impact of negative role models.
   Finally, schools are a microcosm of our society. As such,
they are an instrumental tool in the socialization of
American citizens. An inaccurate and biased education
contributes to the prejudices and misconceptions that others
have about African-Americans and that many African-Americans
have about themselves. To advocate the continuance of such an
educational injustice facilitates the miseducation of all and
further promotes many of the societal problems represented
daily in the media. This is the real tragedy.

   Was Mr. Kristol trying to be funny? Saying that blacks
were "among the earliest arrivals" to this country must set a
record for most misguided euphemism. I suppose inmates on
Alcatraz were "island dwellers" and that Franco's condition
has remained stable.
   Jordan Eth

   Assimilation among earlier ethnic groups, though
difficult, happened because these people became Americans and
lost their ethnic identity, even if they maintained some
family traditions privately. That is much more difficult for
blacks to do, because no matter how well they adopt the local
culture, they are still black and still subject to all those
little racial insults, whether real or imagined. Small wonder
that some blacks decide to chuck trying, and develop a
culture they can live with. Wrong-headed as this might be,
calling it "psychobabble" isn't going to help much either.
   We need to show blacks that there really is a place for
them in mainstream American culture, and if teaching black
history helps boost their pride and bring them along, so much
the better. The alternative is a perpetuation of two separate
Americas, which helps no one.
   Timothy F. Merker

   Grant it that black Americans have not become
"Americanized" to the degree of Hispanics or Orientals. But
the "arrival" of blacks on America's shores for nearly two
centuries of slave trade meant being sold, starved, separated
from family, subjected to sexual and physical abuse, and
denied access to educational and economic opportunities
available to "other" groups by virtue of arriving as chattel,
subjected to a life of bondage. And, even after they were
finally emancipated, they were denied access to educational
and economic opportunities. Can we seriously blame certain
black Americans for not wanting to become "Americanized"? Can
we blame them for not wanting to be part of a "process"
rooted in an institution such as slavery? And can we fault
black Americans for seeing "multiculturalism" as an
alternative to the continued second-class status afforded
most blacks in our society? By the way, where do the American
Indians fit into Mr. Kristol's analysis? Why don't we condemn
their failure to "Americanize"? After all, they were here
first]

   When our nation was launched in the late 18th century, we
were primarily from England, speaking English. The waves of
immigrants that came to our shores in the 19th century were
assimilated into our culture by the third generation, and the
English language was the big unifier. When you could speak
English fluently, you were an American. And being an American
meant accepting the culture, social graces and form of
government that were primarily Anglo-Saxon.
   We have been fighting for the past half-century to bring
people together. Multiculturalism represents a major step
backward and is, on balance, far more destructive than
constructive. And why should minorities just include blacks,
Hispanics, Asians, etc.? How long will it be before other
"minorities" are clamoring for the same cultural purity?
   George J. Helwig
   Scarborough, N.Y.
   ---
   As anyone who follows this issue must be aware, the
principal justification for the multiculturalist movement is
that we are rapidly becoming a non-European country and our
culture and teaching of history must reflect that fact.
Multiculturalism, in short, is not simply a radical ideology;
it is a mainstream phenomenon, an historically predictable
outcome of America's revolutionary transformation into a
multiracial, white-minority society. In order to accommodate
itself to that transformation, America is literally
reformulating itself, adopting group rights along with a
radically different "cultural story" to represent our
radically changed and heterogeneous population. This process
is pushed along by the expanding cultural and political power
of minorities and the collapse of morale among a majority
that sees itself rapidly diminishing.
   How strange and tragic it is that conservatives, who see
themselves as the embattled opponents of multiculturalism,
should continue to support the immigration policies that give
multiculturalism its most compelling rationale]

   That few individuals, mainly Afrocentrists, are aware of
the racial character of the ancient Egyptians as a black
people (by today's definitions), should come as no surprise.
   Egyptology was born on the crest of a great wave of racism
and anti-Semitism that swept Anglo and Germanic Europe in the
early 19th century. While Egyptology provided a pretext for
the mass transfer to European museums of the much coveted
wealth of the pyramids, it was also the hoped-for basis that
would legitimize the whitening of the ancient Egyptian
racial-ethnic character. With a Europeanized Egyptian type
that could never be confirmed as ancestor to those West
African peoples taken into New World slavery, it would prove
straightforward -- on moral grounds -- for Europe to justify
the colonization and enslavement of the dark-skinned races.
   Were the whole, unvarnished truth ever revealed in public
education, the white-supremacist impulse that has governed
the Western world for 500 years -- and which Mr. Kristol and
his colleagues staunchly seek to defend -- would lose its
viselike grip on the destinies of the vast majority of the
populace.

   As greater numbers of nonwhite Americans enter the work
force and consumer base, it is becoming clear that our
Western "common" culture no longer works.
   What Mr. Kristol overlooks is that this decline of
Westernism leaves us no surviving basis for social order. In
the gaping hole left by a departing common culture, there is
truly nothing to hold us together as a nation of people.
   America's best and biggest corporations have already made
it a high priority to better understand and manage an
increasingly multicultural workplace. CEOs at these
corporations do not have the luxury of time to reflect about
the loss of common culture; they must meet the challenges
presented daily by heterogeneous markets and labor pools.
   Thus, what must be debated is not whether multiculturalism
will be exploited by opportunists, as Mr. Kristol seems
obliged to conclude, but rather the extent to which
multiculturalism might succeed in reuniting an increasingly
fragmented society. This is an exceedingly important
question. It has a direct bearing on the future health of
American business.
   Mr. Kristol and like-minded thinkers should bear in mind
that we are in acute need of positive ideas. They should be
asking themselves a whole new set of questions: How can we
design a framework that makes room for both Western and
non-Western strains? Reasserts founding principles? Advances
a unifying theme?

   The article is quite apropos and candid. If there is to be
any hope for our educational system and social preservation,
understanding and espousing this philosophy is urgently
necessary for today's leaders.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Moslem women calling
themselves the Vanguard of Chastity paraded through Iran's capital
today in a campaign against ``moral decadence,'' which they said is
creeping into Iranian society.
   The demonstration was part of a fundamentalist backlash against
the more liberal attitudes that have emerged in the Islamic
republic since the August 1988 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani is seeking to improve ties with the
West to secure badly needed foreign investment for postwar
reconstruction. Iranian hard-liners oppose closer Western ties.
   The protesting women wore black chadors, the cloak-like,
head-to-toe robes that Islamic teachings dictate they wear in
public. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said they marched
through Tehran and to Tehran University campus, where Rafsanjani
was delivering his weekly prayer session.
   The demonstrators expressed support for the government, formed
in August after a presidential election, but demanded it do
everything to ``counter the corrupt culture of the West.''
   Hard-liners fear that allowing Western culture to flourish in
Iran, as it did before the 1979 Islamic revolution, will undermine
the revolution.
   Since the cease-fire and the June 3 death of Iran's
revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, there has been a
visible relaxation in observance of the Islamic code that
revolutionary zealots enforced with such severity in the first 10
years after the revolution.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said today's demonstrators read a
nine-point resolution calling for women to be allowed more
participation in political, social and cultural life.
   It also called on Iranian women to ``avoid the vain, luxurious
mode of life'' and observe the Islamic dress code. It asked the
state broadcasting authorities to clean up their programming,
eschew ``corrupt values ... and propagate Islamic values.''
   The postwar period has seen many young women abandoning the
chador for scarves and using cosmetics that have long been banned.
   Some men also have been dressing more stylishly, turning their
backs on the drab revolutionary garb. Many now wear ties,
considered a symbol of Western decadence.
   The radical publication Jomhuri Islami has condemned the trend
and each day publishes letters calling for strict enforcement of
Islamic values.
   One letter, signed by Qorban Husseini of Tehran, complained:
``It has been observed that Tehran shops now sell neckties,
miniskirts _ a full span above the knee _ and so on. When
shopkeepers are asked why they try to promote corrupt Western
clothing, they say that television is allowed to show them.''
   Under a 1987 law, the punishment for failing to observe the
Islamic dress code is 10-20 lashes or a hefty fine. The newspaper
said that unfortunately, ``the law has been put aside.''
   The magazine Pasdar-e Islam even criticized chess, which
Khomeini decreed two years ago was religiously sanctioned, and
boxing, ``one of the most barbaric manifestations of the deviant
Western culture.''
   ``Which chess player has led or played an influential part in
any revolution?'' the magazine asked. ``What scientist or inventor
has used chess to develop his creativity?''

@  Camera Meets Caravaggio

<TEXT>
   I predict a lot of highbrow-furrowing at the new PBS series, "Art of the Western World," which begins tonight and continues for eight Mondays (9-10 p.m. EDT and EST). 
Connoisseurs will abhor seeing two millenniums of masterpieces crammed into that despicable invention, the cathoderay tube. 
And intellectuals will detest hearing Western culture reduced to voice-over narration, even if it is delivered by several respected art historians and the ever-so-Oxonian host, Michael Wood. 

   Yet I also predict that most viewers -- including the students who watch this series as part of an introductory college course -- will find it entertaining, edifying, even inspiring. 
Certainly it's a cut above the type of college course in which students squint at blurry slides and memorize dates without grasping the broader historical context. 
It also beats the sort of elite seminar in which students exalt trendy theories on pedestals of pure ignorance. 

   Any educator worth his salt can tell you that it doesn't help Johnny to learn that Caravaggio's "Entombment" was painted in 1604, or that the painter's deep pictorial space currently influences the post-minimalist work of Frank Stella, if Johnny hasn't a clue about Caravaggio. 
Better to let Mr. Wood describe Caravaggio's realism as an expression of resurgent Catholic faith poised between the Reformation and the Age of Reason -- while the camera compares the faces in the paintings with those outside in the Roman streets. 

   Or better to let Mr. Wood describe the renewed prosperity of early 17th-century Rome to stirring baroque music -- while the camera pans a gushing Bernini fountain, sails into the high baroque halls of the Palazzo Barberini and hovers, like one of the family's heraldic bees, beneath an ornate Bernini ceiling. 
To match this experience, Johnny would need a good reading list, a Walkman, a generous travel allowance and a pair of wings. 

   Praise for the power and mobility of the camera is, of course, heresy to highbrows who blame the decline of Western art on the invention of that infernal machine. 
It's true that photography helped stifle art's representational glory. 
But the camera can also celebrate that glory. 
For example, Program Four (Oct. 23) includes a stunning sequence in which the narrator reads Michelangelo's sonnet about the sin of worshipping art over God, and the camera circles the sorrowful "Rondanini Pieta." 

   What the highbrows don't acknowledge is the fact that much of the magnificent art created before the invention of the camera is actually rather well-served by the camera. 
Mr. Wood suggests, in his introduction to the book accompanying the series, that "film is the true successor of the Greek mimetic revolution, and the West is still in the grip of that obsession with the illusion of reality in art." 

   Yet this compatibility between lofty art and lowly camera fades as the series proceeds. 
Program Seven (Nov. 13) looks at impressionism, arguably the first period in Western art to define itself in opposition to photography. 
The essential optical effects of impressionism aren't reproducible by the camera -- which is ironic, considering that impressionism is the most mass-reproduced style of painting in history. 

   But optical effects are the least of it. 
The film medium has been justly criticized for overwhelming the verbal with the visual -- for having a built-in bias against ideas. 
This bias poses no problems as long as the series offers quick, light sketches of history while providing access to objects, buildings and vistas that viewers might otherwise never see. 
But problems do arise when the series reaches the modern period with its abstract, difficult images and its reliance on complex ideas. 

   Not that film is incapable of conveying any ideas. 
In Program Seven, an art historian named Griselda Pollack delivers a feminist diatribe. 
Standing next to Gauguin's "Spirit of the Dead Watching," a painting of a Tahitian girl cowering on a bed guarded by a black-robed spirit, Ms. Pollack complains, "The power that men enjoy makes women available for artistic experimentation and colonization." 

   To drive home the point, the camera cuts between the girl's frightened face and a particularly menacing photograph of Gauguin. 
Thus, the medium of film is better at conveying crude ideas than subtle ones. 
Ms. Pollack approaches ideological censorship when she implies that the aesthetic concerns of such artists as Gauguin, Manet and Picasso were really just a cover for their aggressive feelings toward the female sex. 

   Speaking of ideological censorship, Program Eight includes an intriguing look at the tripe preferred by that renowned art critic, Adolf Hitler. 
Less intriguing is the dutiful way this segment tramps over the well-trampled ground of 20th-century "isms." 
And for all its groveling before feminism, the show proves surprisingly obtuse about African art (which influenced expressionism and cubism). 
Christopher Green calls it "primitive" and "savage" in an echo of century-old prejudices. 

   Program Nine, which tackles art since World War II, has an even worse time conveying the ideas behind its subject. 
Most disappointing is its failure to display any self-awareness as a medium -- specifically, as a TV program presuming to deal with the plight of art in the age of TV. Ever since Pop Art appeared in the 1960s, the ubiquitousness of mass-media images has been the main preoccupation of artists such as Andy Warhol, whose gimmick (or inspiration, depending on your viewpoint) was to stick those images where people least expected to see them -- in the art museum. 

   The joke has lost its punch, now that the scholarly study of art entails pondering such venerable masterpieces as Warhol's Brillo pads. 
And as Jesse Helms can tell you, there isn't an image under the sun that people don't expect to see in the art museum. 
By now most people have heard Warhol's observation that the effect of his celebrity was to recycle the images he originally took from the mass media back into the mass media. 
At the very least, "Art of the Western World" ought to acknowledge that it is doing just that. 

   But no such luck. 
Instead, we get Rosalind Krauss declaring, in the middle of Times Square, "The media have created a world of images that separates us from nature. . . . 
Reality has become a TV tube." 
However diverting it is to hear such tidings from a person inside a TV tube, it's also annoying. 
I mean, who is this flickering image to tell me, in such a deadly serious manner, that my sense of reality is screwed up? 
It's too bad that "Art of the Western World" loses its light touch just when it needs it the most.

   Don't Change Corporate Culture -- Use It]

   Changing the corporate culture has become the latest
management fad. Every business magazine carries articles
about it. And not a week goes by without my being asked to
run a seminar on the subject.
   There is indeed a need to change deeply ingrained habits
in a good many organizations. Electric-power and telephone
companies always had their profits guaranteed by public
regulation. Now they find themselves up against cutthroat
competition. Customers demand just-in-time delivery.
Consumers are increasingly picky about quality and service.
Employees sue at the drop of a hat alleging discrimination
and sexual harassment. And with product lives shrinking,
there is an urgent need in most mechanical industries in the
U.S. (and even more in those of Europe) to change drastically
the way new products and new models are conceived, designed,
made and marketed, with the process eventually being
telescoped into months from years.

   What these needs require are changes in behavior. But
"changing culture" is not going to produce them. Culture --
no matter how defined -- is singularly persistent. Nearly 50
years ago, Japan and Germany suffered the worst defeats in
recorded history, with their values, their institutions and
their cultures discredited. But today's Japan and today's
Germany are unmistakably Japanese and German in culture, no
matter how different this or that behavior. In fact, changing
behavior works only if it can be based on the existing
"culture."
   Japan is the best example. Alone of all non-Western
countries it has become a modern society, because her
reformers, a hundred years ago, consciously based the new
"Westernized" behavior on traditional Japanese values and on
traditional Japanese culture. The modern Japanese corporation
and university are thoroughly "Western" in their form. But
they were used as containers, so to speak, for the
traditional and thoroughly un-Western culture of the mutual
obligations and loyalties of a clan society -- e.g., in the
lifetime commitment of company to employee and employee to
company, or in organizing industry in "keiretsu," groups of
autonomous firms held together as "vassals" by mutual
dependence and mutual loyalty.
   The reformers of India and China, by contrast, felt that
they had to change their countries' cultures. The only
results have been frustration, friction, confusion -- and no
changes in behavior.
   Another example: Konrad Adenauer in the 1920s was a vocal
critic of Weimar Germany, for its "bourgeois" values, its
greed, its materialism, its worship of money and business.
When he became chancellor of a defeated Germany after World
War II he deliberately and uncompromisingly strove to restore
the pre-Hitler "bourgeois" Germany he so thoroughly detested.
When criticized -- and he was harshly attacked by
well-meaning "progressives" both in Germany and in the West
-- he answered: "Pre-Hitler Germany, no matter how deficient,
is the only culture Germans alive today know that still
worked; we have no choice but to use it to build the new, the
post-Hitler Germany."
   But there is also a good -- and American -- business
example: the railroads. In the late 1940s, the American
railroads were losing money hand over fist. Worse still, they
were losing market share to trucks and airplanes even faster.
Yet they were clearly needed -- and so Uncle Sam, everybody
agreed, would have to take them over. And most of the
passenger business did indeed have to be taken over by
government agencies. But passenger business was never more
than one-tenth of railroad traffic.
   The railroads' real business, freight traffic, remained
totally private in the U.S. -- the only country in the world
where this is the case. Moreover, the American railroads are
the only ones that make money. Every other railroad system is
virtually bankrupt. And the railroads in the U.S. carry a
significant share of the country's freight -- a little more
than one-third of long distance traffic -- with no other
system carrying more than 5% to 8% (and neither the British
nor the Japanese railroads carry even that much). The
American railroads based this turnaround on the existing
values of their managers, their clerks, their train crews --
on the railroaders' dedication to technical standards, for
instance.
   If you have to change habits, don't change culture. Change
habits. And we know how to do that.
   The first thing is to define what results are needed. In
the hospital emergency room, for instance, each patient
should be seen within one minute after arrival by a competent
person -- e.g., an emergency-room nurse. The new model of the
washing machine or of the laptop computer has to be ready for
market testing within 15 months of its predecessor's
introduction. Every customer inquiry, including every
complaint, has to be settled by telephone within 24 hours
(the standard of a well-run mutual-funds firm).
   The next -- and most important -- step is not a "training
session" or a management conference, let alone a lecture by
the big boss. It is to ask: "Where within our own system do
we do this already?"
   The American railroads began their turnaround around 1948
or 1949 when executives at the Union Pacific, the Chesapeake
&amp; Ohio and the Norfolk &amp; Western first asked: "What is the
most important result we need?" They all answered: "To get
back on the railroad the shipment of finished automobiles
from factory to dealer." Then they asked: "Is anyone on any
railroad actually doing this?"
   The moment the question was asked, they all realized that
one subsidiary of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio -- the one serving
Flint, Mich., home of the Buick Division of General Motors --
was actually increasing its share of finished-automobile
shipments while every other railroad in the country was
losing automobile business. Yet all these people in Flint had
done was to find out what traditional railroad services Buick
needed and was willing to pay for -- and then to provide the
service with true excellence.
   Marshall Field in Chicago was one of the first of the
high-class big-city department stores to get into trouble, in
the 1970s -- and one of the first ones to get out of trouble
too. Three or four successive CEOs tried to change the
culture -- to no avail. Then a new CEO came in who asked,
"What do we have to produce by way of results?" Every one of
his store managers knew the answer, "We have to increase the
amount each shopper spends per visit." Then he asked, "Do any
of our stores actually do this?" Three or four -- out of 30
or so -- did it. "Will you then tell us," the new CEO asked,
"what you people do that gives you the desired results?"
   In every single case these results were achieved not by
doing something different but by systematically doing
something everyone had known all along should be done, had in
the policy manuals, and had been preaching -- but only the
few exceptions had been practicing.
   The next step, therefore, is for top management to make
sure that the effective behavior as it develops out of the
organization's own culture is actually being practiced. This
means, above all, that senior management systematically asks,
again and again: "What do we in senior management, and in
this company as a whole, do that helps you to produce the
results that all of us are agreed are the necessary ones?"
And: "What do we do that hampers you concentrating on these
necessary results?" People who successfully managed to get
old and entrenched organizations to do the needed new things
ask these questions at every single meeting with their
associates -- and take immediate action on what they hear.
   Finally, changing habits and behavior requires changing
recognitions and rewards. People in organizations, we have
known for a century, tend to act in response to being
recognized and rewarded -- everything else is preaching. The
moment people in an organization are recognized -- for
instance by being asked to present to their peers what made
them successful in obtaining the desired results -- -they
will act to get the recognition. The moment they realize that
the organization rewards for the right behavior they will
accept it.
   The best example: the way the American military services
worked together in the recent Iraq campaign. In the invasion
of Grenada in 1983 there was no cooperation at all between
the services -- if there had been the slightest opposition,
the invasion would have ended in disaster. The military
immediately organized all kinds of conferences, pep sessions,
lectures and so on, to preach cooperation. Still, less than a
year and a half ago, the Panama invasion almost foundered
because the services still did not cooperate.
   Only a year later, in Iraq, cooperation worked as no
service cooperation ever worked before. The reason: Word got
around, I am told, that henceforth the appraisal of an
officer's cooperation with other services -- as judged by
those other services -- would be a material factor in
promotion decisions.

<F P=106> [Article by Wei Jingsheng (7614 0079 3932) dated 30 November </F>
1993: "China and the World" -- originally published in OU CHOU 
JIH PAO; first three paragraphs are editor's note] 
  [Text] It was rumored that Wei Jingsheng, who was detained 
by the mainland authorities on 1 April this year, would be 
prosecuted and tried once again. Although Beijing has denied 
the rumor, Wei Jingsheng's fate in the days to come worries the 
outside world to a certain extent. 
  At the beginning of this year, a female French Sinologist, a 
friend of Wei Jingsheng, brought the two articles which Wei 
Jingsheng wrote at the end of last year to France. At that 
time, Wei told her that he hoped to see the two articles 
published in Europe. Being devoted to the trust conferred on 
her, his friend wrote and published articles in CROISSANCE and 
LIBERATION, introducing the contents of the two articles. The 
Chinese versions of the two articles were handed to OU CHOU JIH 
PAO [EUROPE DAILY], a subsidiary of LIEN HO PAO, for exclusive 
publication. This newspaper reprints them today. Wei Jingsheng 
entitled his articles "China and the World" and "How to Invest 
in China." Today we reprint the article: "China and the World." 
  In his article "China and the World," Wei Jingsheng appealed 
to European and American countries to support the democracy 
movement and the reform process in mainland China for the sake 
of long-term interest. He maintained that the issue of the fate 
and future of the Chinese people is a major issue which has a 
bearing on the future of mankind and it is much more important 
than selling a nuclear power station. 
  It is common knowledge that China is equal to one-fourth of 
mankind. It is the only great classic civilization that has 
lasted up to this day, and so far is the largest country that 
has been under one-party rule by the Communist Party. 
Nevertheless, what kind of country is China, in reality? What 
kind of people are the Chinese? What kind of relationship do 
they share with the other parts of the world? These are things 
on which no one is very clear. This being the case, it is both a 
logical and extremely dangerous state of affairs that importance 
has not yet been attached to China's affairs and to its 
influence on the future world. 
<H5>  China Does Not Necessarily Lack Any Tradition of Legality </H5>
  China has age-old cultural traditions that differ from 
European culture. China's culture is unique, and has been very 
successful over the past 5,000 years. Apparently, it will 
retain the majority of its fine substance in the years to come, 
and on that basis, a new cultural system will be formed. Some 
Chinese and Europeans maintain that, like many other backward or 
weak nations, China can accept European culture totally and 
uncritically, and can develop its modern civilization with 
European culture as the mainstay. This is obviously wrong. The 
reason this is wrong is not that China is incompatible with 
modern European civilization. Quite the contrary, the Chinese 
were the fastest in accepting the European culture among all 
nations besides the Europeans; they were even faster than some 
European nations. 
  More often than not, Westerners who know the Chinese are 
amazed at the speed and the degree of understanding with which 
the Chinese (not referring exclusively to the Chinese of today) 
accept Western cultures, as well as science and technology. The 
fact that Western science and technology -- and cultures, in 
particular, those forerunners of democratic and liberal ideas -- 
and Chinese traditional culture have close links shows that 
Chinese and Western civilizations are not incompatible. 
Otherwise, we would be unable to explain why Copernicus, 
Leibniz, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and others were very 
familiar with, and even had the greatest esteem for Chinese 
culture. Although Europe's modern democratic legal system 
differs in essence from China's classic autocratic legal system, 
Montesquieu charted the blueprint for Europe's modern legal 
system by using China's classic forms of legal system as direct 
reference. Therefore, the allegation by the Communists, and of 
the royalists of the older generation before them, that the 
Chinese lack a tradition of legality is sheer nonsense. 
<H5>  The CPC Does Not Tolerate the Existence of a Normal Legal </H5>
System 
  In fact, when it comes to some of the basic ideas of the 
modern legal system, such as "Everyone being equal before the 
law," the Europeans were not the first to discover them; 
instead, they were translated directly by the forerunners of 
democracy -- including Montesquieu -- from China's legal system 
culture. The principle that "if a prince violates the law, he 
will be punished just like ordinary people" has existed in 
Chinese legal clauses for at least 2,000 years. Although these 
modern principles and ideas of legality were not accurately 
guaranteed in the classical autocratic legal system, and were 
violated frequently by members of the ruling groups, which had 
unrestricted supreme power in their hands, they really served as 
the basis on which honest law-enforcement personnel protected 
the people's rights and interests, thus playing a genuine role 
-- to a certain extent -- in protecting human rights and in 
maintaining social fairness and stability. The forerunners of 
democracy and the legal system in Europe have raised the status 
and role of these ideas and principles greatly, and have 
developed a completely new democratic legal system, thus 
enabling these basic ideas and principles to play a greater role 
in protecting human rights and maintaining stability. Thus, the 
argument asserting that the Chinese -- who were the earliest to 
put forward these ideas and principles and who had been familiar 
with them for more than 2,000 years -- were not suited to the 
ideas and principles of legality which obviously were favorable 
to them can be nothing but sheer nonsense. I can hardly find 
any other more accurate adjectives. 
  This kind of lawless situation exists in China, but it is 
not a continuity of Chinese tradition. It was borrowed by the 
Chinese communists from the non-legal tradition in ancient 
European culture. They integrated this kind of feudal and 
antilegal "communism" with "small-peasant liberalism," which was 
a branch of the traditional Chinese culture, to form the 
"Chinese-style Maoist" legal ideology. They used this ideology 
to mobilize the peasants to overthrow the legal system that had 
lasted for more than 2,000 years in China, and they built a 
contemporary lawless despotic regime characterized by 
small-peasant opportunism. This despotic regime, therefore, is 
unable to tolerate the existence of a normal legal system, no 
matter in terms of ideological principle or in terms of 
practice. So 40 years after the nation's founding, a 
preliminary legal system still is nowhere to be found, so 
naturally the country cannot be ruled by law. It resembles a 
robot, and you treat its head when its head aches, treat its 
foot when its foot hurts. There is always a specific therapy 
for every illness, but there is no fixed, predictable, and 
systematic prescription for every illness. Therefore, politics 
in China can only maintain this kind of chaotic situation, which 
is highly fortuitous, unpredictable, and adjusted by a small 
handful of persons using expedient measures. This style of 
maintenance is the most difficult one, as well as an operational 
style that places the harshest demands on leaders. Or it may be 
regarded as a style for which it is almost impossible to find a 
suitable operator to ensure its good operation, so I say that 
the CPC regime is a power structure that harbors great factors 
for turmoil. 
<H5>  Internal Power Struggle Most Likely Cause for Turmoil </H5>
  Turmoil can erupt in many areas and in different ways. The 
greatest possibility is that it will erupt from the power 
struggle within the CPC. Reason number one: Although peasant 
and worker riots are the easiest way for it to erupt, owing to 
the overwhelming difference between their own ability and the 
might of the modern machine of suppression, riots can be only 
the catalyst for intensifying social conflict and cannot be the 
main way to overthrow the government. Reason number two: The 
road through which an opposition party promotes progressive 
changes or so-called peaceful evolution to democratic system has 
been completely blocked by those in power. With the silent 
consent of governments in the West, the CPC gradually has 
tightened its control over the mass media, to the extent that 
new thoughts and ideas cannot spread. So the possibility that 
exploration into new thoughts and ideas may lead to social 
consensus diminishes, whereas the CPC does not have new thoughts 
and ideas that can win a general consensus in society. What it 
has is only the evil method of eliminating its opponents in a 
brutal and unreasonable way. Thus, Chinese society will maintain 
a blind, confused, chaotic, and antigovernment mentality for a 
long period of time. This is how things are at the moment. 
Aside from the fact that the CPC fails to offer any presentable 
and convincing theory, even if it could, it would find no major 
opponent. The CPC solves one problem only to find another 
cropping up. Apart from normal modern democratic thought, there 
are numerous strange thoughts and theories confronting the CPC's 
lack-of-thinking theory in the struggle to win hearts and minds, 
and almost all of them are very successful. To conclude, the 
most likely cause for great turmoil in China in the future is 
the struggle for power and interests within the CPC. 
<H5>  China's Influence Greater Than Is Estimated by Historians </H5>
  Over the past four decades, owing to the self-imposed 
closure 
by the CPC and the blockade by the international community, 
China was comparatively isolated from the world, so for many 
people, China has nothing much to do with the world. Many 
people even think that China's situation does not have anything 
to do with their countries and their interests; so why bother 
whether the Chinese people live or die? Although this kind of 
thinking is not quite in line with the humanitarianism and 
humanism declared by the Europeans, it is indeed a principle 
followed by many European politicians, and it also influences 
the attitude of a majority of Europeans. In fact, these 
politicians who believe in pragmatism have covered up many facts 
that already have happened and will soon happen beside you. 
  Since the middle of 19th century, when China and Europe 
began 
frequent trade interactions, every major incident that happened 
in China has had something to do with the West, and has become 
an important topic in the governments and parliaments in the 
Western countries. By the time of World War II, China already 
had become one of the major and indispensable members of the 
Western allies, and the important role it played in winning the 
antifascist war can be matched only by the two great countries: 
The United States and the Soviet Union. The trends of this 
century have indicated that the closer China's relationship with 
the rest of the world becomes, the more evident is its 
importance as the largest part of mankind. The importance of 
this nation, which Napoleon called a sleeping lion, is in direct 
proportion to the degree of its consciousness. After World War 
II, the situation was even more shocking. The establishment of 
the Maoist regime changed the political pattern of the whole 
world, and almost every foreign and domestic condition and 
policy in the Western countries was affected by this incident. 
The theory of violent revolution exported by Mao Zedong also 
became the main ideology in the world during the 1960's and 
1970's, and its influence spread to every corner of the world 
and has not yet disappeared even to this day. What is more 
important is that the Democracy Wall movement and the continuous 
development of the pro- democracy movement in China, have become 
the starting point for the tides of democracy in "socialist 
countries," and its important role in human history cannot 
possibly be adequately evaluated by contemporary historians or 
anybody else. The importance of such a country should be beyond 
dispute, and any change it goes through -- for better or for 
worse -- will have a decisive impact on the future development 
of mankind which will be hard to evaluate. 
  If some 
politicians have to satisfy the need of some businessmen, so 
they tell you that "it is unimportant," would you not feel that 
this is an extremely irresponsible deception? I think, if I 
were a French or American politician who had a responsible 
attitude toward his country and people, I would sacrifice some 
commercial sponsorships or even votes, in order to fully support 
China's democracy movement and reform process because whether 
China has a strong noncommunist democracy movement is a crucial 
and decisive factor determining whether China can embark on the 
road of cooperation between the government and the people in 
peacefully reforming the social system. Whether China follows 
the road of peaceful democratic reform or waits for a war among 
the warlords is no longer a matter that concerns the fate and 
future of the Chinese people alone; it also has a bearing on the 
immediate interests of the French and American peoples. I think 
that this is more important than whether or not they can sell 
one more nuclear power plant because the interests of the French 
and American peoples do not terminate when tenures expire. An 
old saying in China goes: One who has no long-term 
considerations has imminent worries. A person who looks down on 
long-term interests often will be plagued by present 
difficulties that he cannot overcome. 
<H5>  The West Should Help Promoting Democracy Movement </H5>
  I want to take this opportunity to tell everyone that my 
friendship with the Europeans begins with two Frenchmen. It is 
precisely from them that I have discovered that the Chinese and 
Europeans can understand and help each other easily. I hope 
this kind of friendship and understanding can break through the 
blockade by the CPC and reach out to all Europeans and Chinese. 
This way, our world certainly would be a better one!

   Today's lesson is from Granta 36.

   In a coherent culture, it would be clear to anyone reading
that sentence that I was pretending to be an Episcopal
minister preparing to give a sermon whose text would be the
current issue of a leading literary quarterly. In England, I
could probably expect more people to get the allusion, since
it is from pulpits of the Church of England that the weekly
reading of a text from scripture was first called a lesson.
   Here we have, by constitutional first principle, no
established church, and so only a minority among us have
heard that phrase in its pristine context. Fewer still,
within this minority, have the Latin to experience the word
lesson in church as anything except quaint. Perhaps they lump
it together with other Sunday-morning archaisms such as "the
quick and the dead."
   The preacher's use of "lesson," however, is not just
oldfangled: It has the specific sense of a "reading" from the
Bible (lesson derives from the Latin word for reading,
"lectio.")
   Granta, in its muscular-aesthete way, is a stab (in the
dark?) at joining the splinters of the culture that long ago
fanned out from Britain and claimed the imaginations of
English-reading peoples from Boston to Poona. Just to
describe the magazine's administrative structure reminds us
of the global heritage a shared language still permits. The
editor and informing spirit of Granta is an American, Bill
Buford. Granta originated in Cambridge, England, but its list
of writers is international and it has acquired an
international owner, Penguin, the British paperback titan now
merged with Viking, the U.S. house.
   Now as a native American, non-Christian, I can't claim
that these allusions to antique Anglican parlance, buried
Latinity and a British intellectual quarterly speak to my
specific heritage in any way. It would be perfectly logical,
not to say trendy, for me to reject this kind of cultural
backdrop as
white/Anglo-Saxon/European/theocratic/male/imperialist
irrelevance. The kind of education and lifetime reading
practice that would allow a person to "get the point" of my
opening sentence implies a traditional curriculum and a
mainstream cultural focus that makes so-called
multiculturalists snarl and then demand yet another required
course in Third World Women Writers Born After 1950.
   Such cultural activists have a point, beautifully
exemplified by the absurdity of schoolchildren in
post-colonial Francophone Africa learning to read with the
standard old French primer that began: "Nos ancetres les
Gaulois." Our ancestors the Gauls. But this same system also
did put the liberating, brilliant literature and culture of
France and Europe within the easy grasp of students who
emerged broader people, truly multicultural.
   In this country, the fight over bilingual education now
besieges an educational system never very secure in its goals
and threatens to shatter it, letting each splinter group
teach its traditions and denying any centrality to the
"Master Culture" of the West. On the other side of the
barrier are conservatives who want to make English the
official language of the land and compel all high school
graduates to memorize "Paradise Lost."
   New multicultural programs will inevitably arise; they are
already doing so. And however much some of us may want to
stop this wave, it won't stop because we shout at it. The
goal should be to direct its force so that the new programs
do not become empty exercises in the falsification of history
and the exclusive study of modern literature from the Third
World.
   In particular, Hispanic Studies must not be limited to
recent literature of a politically correct cast. The Spanish
language is the only cultural link of consequence between
Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and new arrivals from the
countries of the Andes. Any sound intellectual approach to
teaching students from these very different backgrounds about
their Hispanic heritage must begin with Spain -- with
Cervantes, with Lope de Vega, even with Gongora, the florid
and arcane lyric master of baroque poetry -- so that the
great writing of today in Latin America will resonate
properly in the minds of young readers. In this way, the
long, global tradition of Hispanic culture can give
inner-city Hispanic students a historically accurate sense of
how they got where they are. Let them be taught to read all
the great books in their language. This will honorably
fulfill the task of education in the humanities, while giving
students legitimate cause for cultural pride that goes beyond
sessions in political indoctrination masquerading as school.
   To see what this could mean, open Granta 36, which is
mostly given over to essays about the Peruvian novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa's failed campaign for the presidency of his
country. Mr. Vargas Llosa, one of the great living
practitioners of his language, himself contributes a piece
called "A Fish Out of Water." With rich irony, he describes
the campaign -- the mortal dangers of speechifying in
guerrilla territory, the awful lack of privacy -- and then
tells how he saved himself:
   "At night, before going to sleep, I read poetry -- always
the classics of the Spanish Golden Age, and usually Gongora.
It was a purifying bath. I stepped away from arguments,
plots, intrigues, invectives and was welcomed into a perfect
world, resplendently harmonious, inhabited by nymphs and
villains, full of coded references to Greek and Roman
fictions, of subtle music and bare, spare architectures. I
had read Gongora since my university years with a rather
distant admiration; his perfection seemed to me a touch
inhuman and his world too cerebral and chimerical. But now I
was grateful to him for being abstract and remote, for having
built a Baroque enclave outside of time, suspended in an
illustrious realm of intellect and sensibility, emancipated
from the ugly, the mean and the petty, the mediocre, from the
sordid facts of daily life."
   If there is going to be bilingual education for Hispanics,
this is the image that should be in the minds of the people
inventing the program. They should design their curriculum so
that its success would be defined by Mr. Vargas Llosa, the
modern New World Hispanic writer par excellence, retreating
for a precious moment from the ragged world of Peruvian
politics to bathe in the cool, dark mythological waters of
Gongora, penned in southern Spain 400 years ago.

By Nesta Ramazani, Ramazani writes on the subject of women in the Muslim world, 
her articles appearing in such journals as the Middle East Journal, Middle East 
Insight, and Journal of South Asian and Middle Eastern Studies. She is the

In the decade since the overthrow of the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi 
and the start of the Iranian revolution, a virulent strain of Islamic 
fundamentalism has spread throughout the Muslim world, espousing a social order 
that appears to promote medieval attitudes, to restrict individual freedoms and 
to foster misogynist beliefs. Yet, women in one Muslim country after another, 
many of them educated in the West, have flocked to its banner, repudiating 
Western clothing and value systems and declaring themselves willing to fight 
and die for their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Those early Western-inspired feminist movements in such countries as Egypt, 
Iran, Lebanon and even Turkey, which sought to improve the lot of women through 
legislation limiting polygamy and restricting men's freewheeling divorce and 
custody rights, appear to be dead. In their place have emerged widespread 
demands to return to Islamic roots, to rescind foreign-inspired legislation, to 
reintroduce Islamic sharia law, to re-segregate educational systems. And 
everywhere, women appear in the forefront of a movement to return to a 
seemingly outmoded way of life, one that restricts their activities and limits 
their choices. 
</P>
<P>
Minou Reeves seeks to explore the reasons for the resurgence of Islam in the 
late 20th Century, to explain the baffling paradox of women who freely 
sacrifice their lives in war, bravely engage in guerrilla attacks, actively 
take part in combat, yet voluntarily return to the veil, historically a symbol 
of their exclusion from public life. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to uncover the sources of a phenomenon that has baffled and even 
frightened many world leaders, the author links the resurgence of Islamic 
traditions to anti-Western attitudes, whose roots lie in centuries of 
confrontation between the West and the Islamic world, and more recently in 
"anti-colonialist" and "anti-imperialist" sentiments born of post-World War II 
experiences with foreign powers. 
</P>
<P>
She outlines the historical development of repressive customs and attitudes 
toward women in Muslim societies, in spite of Islam's originally liberating and 
progressive tenets. She delineates the absorption into Islam of such 
pre-existing local customs and practices as veiling and polygamy, showing how 
obscurantist exegetes reinforced the misogynistic attitudes of patriarchal 
societies. 
</P>
<P>
She follows the emergence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries of Muslim 
reformers in Egypt and Tunisia who objected to misogynistic interpretations of 
the Koran and the hadith (the sayings of the prophet Muhammad). She touches 
upon early 20th-Century reforms in such countries as Tunisia, Iran and Turkey, 
which resulted from attempts at modernization inspired by Western models. She 
sees feminism within the broader framework of nationalist and socialist 
tendencies of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The major contribution of this book lies in the author's sketching of the 
larger historical and political framework for today's Islamic revival and in 
making it clear that the resurgence of Islam cannot be understood outside of 
the nationalist revival. The author has tackled a large and complex subject and 
has managed to weave together many strands into a comprehensible and valuable 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
A narrower focus, however -- on Iran alone -- might have made this an even more 
valuable book. The author has spread herself thin by attempting to cover too 
much. Although she singles out Iran as the major moving force behind the 
Islamic revival, in touching on events in a number of other Muslim countries 
she neither does justice to them, nor to Iran. Had she concentrated exclusively 
on the Iranian revolution, the author might have succeeded in exploring the 
resurgence of Islam in far greater depth. 
</P>
<P>
She might, for example, have examined in more detail -- and with actual 
anecdotal accounts -- the difficulties that a tradition-bound and 
underdeveloped country such as Iran faced when trying to compress several 
hundred years of modernization into one or two decades. She might have 
explained what cultural aspects of Western culture have been so offensive to 
Muslim sensibilities as to have provoked violent rejection. 
</P>
<P>
She might have recounted, through the testimony of those who lived through the 
revolution, what it was like to have experienced the trauma and the chaos of 
those times. She might have studied, through the words of Iranian religious 
leaders (many of whom are at odds with one another), the unresolved conflicts 
over national goals, philosophy, and identity that continue to plague Iran and 
that, at a deeper level, were to some degree responsible for the force of the 
explosion that rocked this ancient land. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, by limiting her sources to published documents, the author, in the 
end, does not succeed in leading the reader across the cultural barriers to see 
events as an insider. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these shortcomings, however, this book is a much-needed corrective to 
the paucity of objective information available to Western readers on the 
subject of Muslim women. It goes a long way toward combatting much 
disinformation, as well as misinformation, on the Muslim world in general and 
its women in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, writing as she was at the height of Iran's xenophobic anti-Westernism, 
the author could not have foreseen the current trend in Iran toward moderation 
and pragmatism, as exemplified by the ending of the Iran-Iraq war. Recalled 
from the front, women are having to put down their arms and set aside their 
virulent anti-Western rhetoric. What role they will be allowed to play, amid 
the high unemployment and economic chaos of their war-torn and 
revolution-ravaged land, remains to be seen. But that is another chapter, and 
it has not yet been written.

  [Excerpts] The first congress of Iranologists and of 
Persian language and literature academicians from Central Asia 
and the Caucasus opened in Tehran on Friday afternoon, 4 
February, with a message from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani at 
the Cultural Heritage Organization. The congress, which is to 
continue until tomorrow, Monday, will study the role of Persian 
language and literature in the region and its influence on the 
culture and literature of countries in Central Asia and the 
Caucasus. [passage omitted] 
  Persian language and literature, which is influenced by 
Islam, prevails in extensive areas in southern, central, and 
western Asia and the peoples and nations in the region are 
familiar with this language and literature. This is at a time 
when the 70-year presence of communism in countries north of 
Iran prevented these peoples from becoming better acquainted 
with Persian culture and language and, as a result, from 
becoming better acquainted with their own ancient culture. The 
emergence of the Islamic revolution and the liberation of the 
nations in Central Asia and the Caucasus from the yoke of 
communism has made these nations show more interest in learning 
about Iran and its culture and language. 
  The truth is that the countries of the former Soviet Union 
are exerting great efforts to acquire their own culture and 
identity and to return to their historic Islamic roots. 
Meanwhile, the West is trying to propagate its own culture and 
to encourage these countries to follow Western culture. Thus, 
having strong cultural ties with these countries, and especially 
with Muslim-inhabited areas, can help them become acquainted 
with the Persian language and culture and with Islamic teachings 
and also help them realize that, like Iran, they can use Islamic 
culture to further enrich their society, language, literature, 
and culture and can do without the West.

   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett
charged Monday that recent changes in its Western culture course
requirements at Stanford University represented a victory for
radical students who employed ``the tactics of intimidation.''
   ``A great university was brought low by the very forces which
modern universities came into being to oppose _ ignorance,
irrationality and intimidation,'' Bennett charged in a speech
prepared for delivery on the Stanford campus in California.
   Stanford President Donald Kennedy denied Bennett's allegations
and accused Bennett of using ``his bully pulpit to bully rather
than to engage the issues.''
   Kennedy said Bennett had refused an offer to debate with
university officials and insisted instead on having ``a platform to
speak unopposed.''
   Among the sponsors of Bennett's speech were the Stanford
Conservative Forum and the Stanford College Republicans.
   Stanford's Black Student Union, feminists and other minority
student groups had agitated for changes in the Western culture
requirement.
   Stanford's faculty senate voted 39-4 on March 31 to alter its
Western culture requirement for freshman to include the study of
non-European cultures and works by women and minorities. They also
renamed the requirement, effective in the fall of 1989, ``Cultures,
Ideas and Values.''
   Freshmen entering this fall still will have to read from the Old
and New Testaments and works by Plato, Augustine, Machiavelli,
Rousseau and Marx. But works by Dante, Luther, Locke, Freud,
Voltaire, Darwin, Nieztsche and several others have been dropped
from the core list.
   Starting in 1989, the Cultures, Ideas and Values faculty will
decide which texts, authors, themes and issues will be taught in
six to 10 different tracks.
   The faculty senate decided that each track must include works
from at least one non-European culture and confront ``issues
relating to class, ethnicity, race, religion, gender and sexual
orientation.'' Students will have at least one major reading each
quarter on race, gender or class issues.
   In a related matter, the chancellor of the University of
Massachusetts on Monday lashed back at Bennett, who had accused the
school of being too lenient in handling a protest by minority
students.
   ``Students here were treated with respect but also firmness,''
Chancellor Joseph Duffey said. ``They left the building because
they were treated with respect, not because they got what they
wanted.''
   Minority students took over a campus building at UMass for six
days in February to protest campus racism, and Bennett on Sunday
complained that administrators sent ``the demonstrators a basket of
fruit and ordered out Chinese food for them and then gave in to all
of their demands ... one wonders what kind of teaching experience
that is.''
   Bennett previously had injected himself into the debate at
Stanford in February, when he said that ``faculty trashing of Plato
and Shakespeare'' was eroding the credibility of higher education.
   Kennedy said in an interview after he read the advance text of
the speech that the faculty had made ``a significant improvement''
in the curriculum and that Bennett obviously had not followed the
controversy very carefully.
   ``I don't believe he can possibly have read the ultimate
compromise carefully or read the arguments in the debate that led
up to it,'' Bennett said.
   ``I'm disappointed that people on both sides of the original
debate won't have a chance to respond,'' Kennedy said. ``But I
certainly hope they will respond in other forums.''
   Kennedy said the faculty ``has made the core list more flexible
and it has introduced some notion of comparative analysis into that
curriculum.''
   But Bennett said that even though some may portray the new
requirement as ``a minor pedagogical change ... the fact is that
the core reading list of 15 significant works in Western philosophy
and literature has been thrown out.''
   Instead, instructors will decide year by year what the course
content will be, he said. ``Does anyone doubt that selecting works
based on ethnicity or gender of their authors trivializes the
academic enterprise?'' Bennett asked.
   He said ``the tactics of intimidation'' had brought about the
changes.
   ``The loudest voices have won, not through force of argument,
but through bullying, threatening and name-calling. That's not the
way a university should work,'' Bennett said.

<HL> At Last: Capitalistic Communism

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>

<TEXT>
   "Advertising," the chief of the Advertising Department of the State Administration of Industry and Commerce told the Third World Advertising Congress, "has not only played an important role in promoting the country's production and marketing of goods and foreign trade, and in increasing state revenues and earnings of enterprises, but has also helped people to acquire more knowledge, broaden their fields of vision, cultivate better manners, and displayed the new look of socialism." 

   Socialism? 
What's going on here? 
In 1980, the speaker continued, her country had fewer than 10 advertising agencies; now it has nearly 7,000. 
It offers one of the world's largest advertising markets. 
The country's nearly 80 million TV sets reach 350 million viewers during peak broadcasting hours. 
Socialism, the visitor to China discovers this summer, has indeed acquired a new look. 

   What strikes the visitor most is the explosion of commercial and entrepreneurial energy. 
This explosion has brought new wealth to the countryside and fills city streets with the bustle of shops, stalls, booths and peddlers' carts. 
The bazaar, banished during the bleak Mao years, has returned to China with a bang. 
The sounds of China in the summer of 1987 are the sounds of bargaining and bartering, of wheeling and dealing, the sounds of rampant consumer capitalism. 

   This new China is one more blow to the cherished right-wing myth of communism as totalitarian monolith, uniform in dogma and application, immune to historical permutation and vicissitude, unchanged, unchanging and unchangeable. 
In fact, communism has assumed a variety of forms. 
There is national communism in Romania, North Korea and Vietnam, liberal communism in Hungary, Latin communism in Cuba; even in the Soviet motherland, the communism of Mikhail Gorbachev departs notably from the communism of Stalin. 
But of all the varieties of communist experience the most improbable is surely the capitalistic communism now bursting out all over what used to be called Red China. 

   In carrying out policies of economic reform, the Chinese feel that they enjoy considerable advantages over Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviet reformers. 
The Chinese, they say, have an entrepreneurial tradition the Russians lack. 
The Soviet Union has worse nationality problems than China. 
It has a defense budget that devours its economic resources. 
"Will the Soviet Union in order to carry out economic reforms be prepared to give up military superiority?" one official asked. 
"If they really want reform, their foreign policy will have to undergo changes." 

   In China, foreign policy does not compete with the reform effort. 
Moreover, the Cultural Revolution, for all its woes, has in some respects made the tasks of reform easier in China. 
It crippled the bureaucracy; Deng Xiaoping does not have to wrestle with the rigid structures that eventually may do in Mr. Gorbachev. 

   And the Cultural Revolution thoroughly discredited the utopian remedies of the revolutionary left, thereby making the turn to the market more acceptable. 

   Mr. Deng's economic policies have brought about a considerable increase in production (especially in agriculture), in wealth, in inequality and in corruption. 
White-collar crime is growing. 
At the end of June, the State Council promulgated a new code setting punishments for fraud, profiteering, tax evasion, unauthorized bonuses and other "economic crimes." 
The State Auditing Administration has uncovered financial irregularities covering almost 2% of the total amount audited. 

   The number of lawyers is increasing; in Liaoning Province alone, 2,300 lawyers have opened 122 offices. 
The divorce rate is also rising. 
Beggars and vagrants are seen more often in the streets. 
The de-collectivization of agriculture has elevated short-term profit over long-term considerations of land use and conservation, weakened the traditional system of irrigation, canals and dikes and has exposed the countryside to new threats of soil exhaustion, erosion, pollution and flooding. 

   Mr. Deng seems determined to plunge ahead nevertheless. 
One has the impression that his first goal is to get the country moving again economically. 
He will let 'er rip for the time being and deal with the social costs later. 

   Mr. Deng's political concern is with the maintenance of control during the upheaval of modernization. 
His objective is economic development, not political democracy nor liberalism nor human rights. 
This concern seems to have been the point of the campaign last winter against "bourgeois liberalization." 
Confessing myself an unrepentant bourgeois liberal, I asked Chinese officials and scholars what was so terrible about bourgeois liberalism. 
The great sin, it became evident, is that the doctrine of political competition represents an unacceptable challenge to the monopolization of politics by the Communist Party and therefore, they assert, to social stability and economic reform. 
"We can't afford people who oppose the party leadership," Vice Premier Yao Yilin said. 
"The campaign against bourgeois liberalization is designed to facilitate, not to block, reform." 

   It is no doubt true that a salient Chinese trait through the ages has been fear of disorder and chaos. 
Since Confucius, social harmony has been valued above all. 
Confucianism is authoritarian, hierarchical, collectivist and anti-individualist, making no distinction between state and society and expecting the ruler to transform the behavior of the ruled. 
The Confucian tradition bans disturbers of the peace. 

   Chinese communism is in a real sense an heir to that tradition and is seen today as the bulwark against chaos. 
At the end of August a conference of Confucian scholars will be held at Confucius's birthplace in Qufu. 
As Prof. Wu Teh Yao of Singapore observes, Confucianism is being studied "to counterbalance the impact of values from the West, particularly those of rights and individualism. . . . 
The Confucian system stresses obligations, not rights, and group spirit, not individualism." 

   But memories of the Cultural Revolution remain vivid. 
The determination not to go through anything like that again is expressed constantly and with great intensity. 
The anti-bourgeois liberalization campaign is limited in its targets and has not been pursued with much passion. 
It is now often defended as a campaign against pornography. 
Even here, to judge by the girlie magazines freely on sale in Shanghai, the campaign is languishing. 

   The campaign expresses, however, an understandable anguish over the relationship between the traditional culture and modernization. 
The question is much debated in conferences, seminars and scholarly journals. 
Some savants fear "Westernization" will undermine what one chronicler of the discussion, Zi Zhongyun, calls "the world's longest uninterrupted, integrated culture" and will erode China's national identity. (Hearing small Chinese children sing "Jingle Bells" at a middle school in Beijing, one can understand their concern.) 

   Others argue that the traditional culture holds China back. 
People in Beijing talk of a book titled "The Ugly Chinese" and published in Taiwan. 
In it, the author, Bo Yang, contends that the Chinese must reject Confucianism and the idea that they are a chosen people and instead emulate the spirit of competitive individualism that liberated Europe from feudalism. 

   A second question ought to preoccupy the Chinese leaders. 
They worry about the impact of Westernization on traditional Chinese values. 
They should worry too about the question: How much can communism concede to the marketplace and still remain communistic? 
Their system, the Chinese insist, is "socialism with Chinese characteristics," and it will remain socialist so long as the state owns the means of production and distribution. 
The market, they argue, can coexist with state ownership under the "responsibility" process, which gives individual farms and firms a measure of independence and autonomy. 
It is, they say, a "birdcage" economy, in which the bird is free to fly within the confines of the cage. 
If present trends continue, some surmise, the economy in 10 years will be about 20% state-planned, another 20% will be in the free market, and the remaining 60% will be guided and regulated by the state. 

   The answer is not entirely convincing. 
Individuals today pool their assets and buy a taxi or a tourist bus or start a restaurant or a magazine. 
Shanghai has a rudimentary stock market in which shares are sold to private investors. 
Who "owns" a company that issues shares for public purchase? 
How will the state prevent the reemergence of private property when a shop or a plot of land is leased to the same family for a generation? 
The idea that everything is owned by the state is bound to grow tenuous. 
One notices, too, that the discussion of economic policy is already singularly devoid of Marxist categories, catchwords and attitudes. 

   China is an exciting country today because deep questions of history, culture, politics and economics are being tackled by a shrewd and determined leadership. 
The Chinese experiment has hardly begun. 
No one can tell at this point where it will end. 
The outcome will shape much of the history of the 21st century.

   The National Endowment for the Humanities called for a curriculum overhaul in elementary and secondary schools, including more U.S. history and classic literature. 

   In a report that is the latest government attack on the quality of U.S. education, the NEH said schools fail to teach students about many of the basic events and works in U.S. history and Western culture. 

   The NEH report, issued yesterday, was mandated by Congress in 1985 to assess humanities education in grade schools and high schools. 
As part of its report, the NEH also released partial results of a survey test of 8,000 U.S. 17-year-olds that showed big gaps in their historical and literary knowledge. 

   The NEH report blamed poor performance in the survey on changes in the social studies and English curricula that favor "learning skills," or how-to courses in reading, writing and research, at the expense of basic history and literature. 
"Instead of preserving the past," said NEH Chairman Lynne Cheney in the report, schools today "more often ignore it." 

   The report recommended that much of the social studies curriculum should be scrapped and "replaced with systematic study of history." 
It also said that original work should be used more to replace textbooks and readers, which the report said had been overly simplified. 

   In the multiple-choice test, 40% of the students couldn't place the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor between 1939 and 1943, 39% couldn't pin down the writing of the U.S. Constitution between 1750 and 1800, and 69% couldn't identify the Magna Carta as a foundation of parliamentary government. 
About two-thirds didn't know the authors of "The Canterbury Tales" (Geoffrey Chaucer), "Leaves of Grass" (Walt Whitman) or "The Brothers Karamazov" (Fyodor Dostoevski). 

   Earlier-released results have shown that students had difficulty identifying Winston Churchill, and that 68% didn't know in which half-century the U.S. Civil War took place. 

   About 80% of the students surveyed were enrolled in U.S. history courses at the time. 

   "All of this amazing ignorance didn't exist among our incoming freshmen 10 years ago," said E.D. Hirsch Jr., a University of Chicago professor and author who served on an advisory committee to the report. 
"All this emphasis on technique in our schools was wrong." 

   The latest NEH report follows its similar critique of humanities education in colleges and universities in 1984 by William Bennett, now Secretary of Education. 
Mr. Bennett has repeatedly criticized universities and elementary and secondary schools for placing too much emphasis on teaching skills. 

   Although worried about standards, many educators have been wary of embracing the government's findings. 
Specifically, they say that the Reagan administration is trying to roll back the introduction of more contemporary teaching methods and topics aimed at minorities. 

   "I would agree that content should be reintroduced into the classroom," said S. Michael Halloran, chairman of the department of language and literature at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Rensselaer, N.Y. 
"But culture isn't just what dead people have done or said. 
I don't see much call for diversity or pluralism in a lot of what's coming out of Washington these days."

<HEAD>Professors Debate Diversity in Literature</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Watch your language. Some 10,000 academics -
representing a veritable ``Who's Who'' of English and language
professors - were in town Friday.
   The president of the Modern Language Association says the
group's annual convention is bent on exploring ``the newest of
methods and the oldest of texts.''
   ``I think this association really represents a great commitment
to diversity of inquiry and freedom of thought,'' said Catharine
Stimpson, president of the 32,000-member organization.
   Stimpson said much debate in academic circles today focuses on
the trend on college campuses to teach and review literature beyond
the traditional scope of Western Civilization. New perspectives
include those of minority, feminist, Third-World and homosexual
authors.
   The trend has been criticized for forcing students into
``politically correct'' interpretations of written works and moving
away from the study of classics.
   But the purpose of studying literature is to learn about
cultural values and that study shouldn't be limited to old methods
and established texts, said Stimpson, an English professor at
Rutgers University in New Jersey.
   ``There are lots of different perspectives. Some are richer than
others and some are more comprehensive than others,'' Stimpson
said. ``Historically you can look back at literature to see the way
it's shaped culture's ideas of what is beautiful, what is true.''
   Many professors and graduate students welcomed the move toward
exploring more diverse literature. Some criticized more traditional
presentations for giving the impression that authors must be white,
male, European and dead to be worth studying.
   ``These newer texts, I think, will show students that literature
is still an open-ended enterprise,'' said Robert Hamner, a
professor at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas. ``A
writer doesn't have to be dead to deal with serious issues.''
   Hamner, who specializes in Caribbean literature, has been
teaching since 1968. He said while the movement toward diversity
isn't new, it's finally gaining attention.
   ``Some students find it exciting, they're looking for something
new and interesting,'' Hamner said. ``I tell them to remember that
these writers are not being touted because they're minority
artists. They are just good authors.''
   But introducing a more diverse selection of literature isn't
just a matter of choosing the authors and telling students to start
reading, said Susan K. Harris, who teaches at Queens College, City
University of New York.
   ``Philosophically I'm all for it,'' said Harris, who specializes
in American literature and 19th century women authors. ``But on a
practical level I'm still struggling.''
   Harris said professors encounter difficulty drawing critical and
thematic connections between the newer texts and the classics.
   ``I have found ways to talk about the new literature in artistic
terms,'' she said. ``People critical of the new approach often feel
it's all come down to the fact that we've thrown out art in favor
of diversity.''

CURRICULUM REVISED TO INTRODUCE FRESHMEN TO THEIR INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL

<P>
Stanford University's intellectual atmosphere is calm again. 
</P>
<P>
After two years of violent storms over its revision of the curriculum for 
freshmen, during which former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett and the 
editorial page of the Wall Street Journal repeatedly hurled ideological 
lightning bolts at this rich and placidly beautiful university, the rhetorical 
cold front has passed through. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy arose over the introductory courses known collectively to older 
alumni as "Western Civilization" and more recently as "Western Culture." Such 
courses are an attempt, common to many American universities since World War I, 
to explain to incoming students the assumptions of their intellectual and moral 
heritage and, sometimes, to question those assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's effort -- catalyzed by the protests of minority students -- was to 
broaden the courses to include writings from "women, minorities and persons of 
color" and, incidentally, Americans, none of which had been on the reading 
lists. It stirred, first on the campus, then in the nation, a tempestuous 
debate over the very meaning of civilization and culture in the United States 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Now the freshmen -- currently 1,565 of them -- for whom the changes were 
designed are finishing the first year of the revised curriculum. And though the 
heavy weather has passed, a look into classrooms and faculty offices shows 
signs both of intellectual satisfaction and of continuing intellectual ferment. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, the Journal editorial page staff and others on the political and 
cultural right had accused Stanford of undermining Western civilization and 
culture in a return to the "discredited" radicalism of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"Experience even in the communist world has stilled the dreams of the 1960s, 
but at least one place continues to revere them -- the ivory foxhole known as 
the American academy," the Journal said in an editorial of Dec. 22, 1988. "A 
good example is Stanford University, which earlier this year caved in to 
political pressure and cashiered its popular 'Western Culture' course 
requirement for freshmen." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the changes replied that Stanford was merely trying to prepare 
its students to understand and cope with the rapidly changing America and world 
they were growing up into. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford is trying seriously to consider how one should teach not only in the 
United States but particularly in California," said Keith Baker, an 
intellectual historian at the school. "Universities exist to raise serious 
questions, critical questions, about our cultural heritage -- what it is and 
how to teach about it. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems with American culture is that students bring together a 
whole lot of assumptions, without knowing how those assumptions have been 
created and how there are tensions between them. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford is saying this is a multicultural society, we live in a multicultural 
world. How do we best make sense of it for students? How do we best prepare 
students to live in a multicultural world?" 
</P>
<P>
At one level, the debate could be seen as an intra-faculty, inter-departmental 
struggle for students. (More students = more faculty = more prestige.) At 
another, it could be viewed as just another setting of the neo-conservatives' 
running morality play, in which they delight in attacking "relativists" 
wherever they think they have found them. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, on another level, some participants in the debate agreed, the question 
Stanford was trying to confront was that put by J. Hector St. John Crevecoeur 
in his "Letters from An American Farmer" (1782): "What, then, is the American, 
this new man?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compromise Adopted 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1988, the Faculty Senate, after rejecting proposals for more 
sweeping changes, adopted a compromise to add works by women and writers from 
previously unrepresented ethnic groups to seven of the standard introductory 
courses and to create a robustly unorthodox new course, "Europe and the 
Americas," to introduce freshmen to the experiences of their world in a 
non-traditional way. The eight courses together were named "Cultures, Ideas, 
and Values," promptly nicknamed "CIV." 
</P>
<P>
Late in the winter quarter of this year the freshmen were nearing the end of 
the second of the three 10-week sessions in CIV that constitute, for students 
in the humanities, the introduction to the intellectual experiences of the rest 
of their Stanford years, and for many of the students in science and 
engineering the heart of their non-science education here. 
</P>
<P>
The green, expansive campus was drenched by the sun under a luminous blue sky, 
though it had been unseasonably cold after a heavy rain. The raucous scrapping 
of the scrub jays in the live oak trees challenged the whir of passing bicycles 
for the loudest noise on campus. Students moved from class to class among the 
famous low sandstone buildings of the Main Quadrangle. 
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Church and many of the more than 400 Neo-Romanesque arches of the 
building porches and their connecting cloister walkways had been shored up 
after damage from the Oct. 17, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake. The quake closed 
the church, the Stanford Museum, and many other buildings, and caused, in all, 
$160 million in damage. Professors had been doubled up in offices; some classes 
were meeting in smaller rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In one of them one afternoon, 18 freshmen from the "Europe and the Americas" 
course were talking with their instructor, Debbie Gordon, about "Uncle Tom's 
Cabin." They had just read selections from Alexis de Toqueville's "Democracy in 
America"; they would next read Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness." This is the 
course that drew most of the fire from outside. It proceeds more by 
juxtaposition of texts than by chronological exposition. It includes not only 
readings from the Bible and St. Augustine's "Confessions" but also such works 
as Frantz Fanon's "The Wretched of the Earth," Virginia Woolf's "A Room of 
One's Own" and Chinua Achebe's "Things Fall Apart." 
</P>
<P>
The instructor went around the room asking each student in turn to talk about 
"Uncle Tom's Cabin." She had been somewhat apprehensive, for its subject -- 
slavery -- might, she thought, make some of the students, especially the 
blacks, uneasy. The question of race and color is not abstract at Stanford. For 
the last decade and more the school, which always accepted both women and men, 
has been making a strenuous effort to recruit minorities, and now the freshman 
class is more than one-third minority -- 18.1% Asian, 8.3% Latino, 8.4% black. 
But the discussion seemed both matter-of-fact and engaged. 
</P>
<P>
"Religion's never been a part of my life, so it was interesting to see how 
Christianity helped Tom survive," a white male student said. 
</P>
<P>
A black woman discussed at some length how the whites in the old South were 
utterly dependent upon their black slaves. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was ironic that the slaves were true Christians, yet the whites 
used Christianity to justify slavery," said another young man, also a member of 
an ethnic minority. 
</P>
<P>
The instructor noted that the author, Harriet Beecher Stowe, wrote about the 
way the "institutionalized racism" exploited blacks for economic gain, yet many 
whites were shown as loving the blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost as if slaves were pets," said a white male in a tone of wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, what does that say about that kind of power?" the instructor asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It says, 'I'm doing what's best for you because you don't know what's best for 
yourself,' " replied a black male. 
</P>
<P>
A white male observed that he thought for the longest time that Stowe was 
black. "It seemed weird a white woman would have the guts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion ranged for an hour and a half. Debbie Gordon brought in such 
topics as regionalism in American culture, religion as an instrument of both 
oppression and liberation, the importance of the concept of self-worth in a 
society as mobile as the American. The dialogue moved easily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incoming Students 
</P>
<P>
Stanford is one of the most selective schools in the country. Its freshmen 
arrive with wildly varying degrees of sophistication and education, but it is 
safe to say they are all bright. 
</P>
<P>
"What distinguishes these students," said Mary Weisling, an instructor in the 
CIV history course who has taught elsewhere, "is that they know how to use 
their time. They usually have a specific goal in mind. They find a way to keep 
integrating their experiences. They arrive here knowing they should keep their 
appointments. At UC Berkeley, for instance, they are no less bright, but a lot 
of them in the first quarter of their freshman year don't keep their 
appointments." 
</P>
<P>
The following week a different group of students from the "Europe and the 
Americas" course was discussing, with Debbie Gordon, "Heart of Darkness." Half 
the students had read the book in high school English classes, where it was 
generally presented as a parable of a voyage into the soul's interior. Here the 
students were asked to look at it as a tale of imperialism and, indeed, racism, 
the exploitation by Belgium of the Congo. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not necessarily one way to read a book," said the instructor. Which 
is the challenge that "Europe and the Americas" presents to conventional 
American methods of teaching an introduction to culture and civilization. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "Culture and Truth," one of the founders of the course, 
anthropology professor Renato Rosaldo from Tucson High School and Harvard 
College, wrote: ". . . Work in cultural studies sees human worlds as 
constructed through historical and political processes, and not as brute 
timeless facts of nature. It is marvelously easy to confuse 'our local culture' 
with 'universal human nature.' " 
</P>
<P>
Or, as his co-founder, Mary Louise Pratt, professor of Spanish and Portuguese, 
put it: 
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely don't believe in the superiority of Western culture. We don't 
believe that the academy should exclude the critique of the West. Is not 
Western civilization itself (in its several stages of development) a critique 
of the West?" 
</P>
<P>
"I am very committed," she said, "to getting people to think relationally about 
Western culture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Primary Sources 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many colleges, which habitually use narrative survey textbooks in 
introductory courses in "Western Civilization" or "World Culture" or the like, 
Stanford insists upon teaching in these courses from primary sources. So when 
it became known to the outside world that Stanford was thinking of changing the 
required reading list for freshmen, the dispute arose over which list of books 
should be the approved "canon" of texts that all educated Americans should 
know, or indeed whether there is such a canon. 
</P>
<P>
In its 1988 editorial, titled derisively "The Stanford Mind," the Wall Street 
Journal attacked "Europe and the Americas" as riding "the main hobbyhorses of 
today's political left -- race, gender and class. The West is perceived not 
through the evolution of such ideas as faith and justice, but through the prism 
of sexism, racism and the faults of its ruling class." The Journal invoked the 
name of Allan Bloom, author of "The Closing of the American Mind," as lamenting 
"the political conformity that now prevails throughout the American academy in 
the name of a fraudulent 'diversity.' " 
</P>
<P>
"As the West is 'phased out' in Palo Alto," the Journal concluded, "it's clear 
enough what's happening to Stanford's mind." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the West was not being "phased out" at Stanford. In addition to 
"Europe andthe Americas," which this year has about 100 students, the other 
seven CIV courses offered to freshmen remained much as they were: literature 
and the arts, great works, history, Western thought and literature, structured 
liberal education, philosophy and Western thought and technology. 
</P>
<P>
All eight courses have in common these readings: the Hebrew and the Christian 
Bible, a classical Greek philosopher, an early Christian thinker, a Renaissance 
dramatist and Karl Marx. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous "Western Culture" survey there had been 15 readings in common, 
including Homer, Machiavelli, Galileo, Voltaire and Freud, with others 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"This is regressive," Education Secretary Bennett said of the changes. "What 
are they doing?" 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the seven continuing courses teach pretty much what they taught 
before, with additions, such as readings from the Koran or "Equiano's Travels," 
the autobiography, greatly popular in the 18th Century, of Olaudah Equiano, the 
former slave captured in Africa; or Mary Wollstonecraft's "A Vindication of the 
Rights of Woman" (1792). 
</P>
<P>
The 15 works in the previous "Western Culture" courses were not, in fact, a 
carefully thought-out "canon," but at least partly a list arrived at through 
faculty horse-trading. The various humanities departments that teach these 
basic courses each strove to use them as introductions, or lures, to bring 
students as majors into their departments. And professors here as elsewhere 
tend to prefer to teach what they know best. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Love and Duty 
</P>
<P>
Only a small number of professors, nearly all of them from the humanities, 
teach these freshman survey courses. As it is, most of the professors who 
taught the previous courses are teaching them in their slightly revised 
versions. There is no career advantage or monetary gain to be had in teaching 
the freshman surveys. Those who do it, do it for love or duty. It is hard, 
because one must simplify and generalize. One can take intelligence for granted 
in the students, but not knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The professors are assisted by teachers like Debbie Gordon and Mary Weisling, 
who are hired from the outside to conduct the smaller sessions of discussion 
that are intended to illuminate and amplify the professors' lectures. For all 
its wealth, Stanford does not have, in its humanities departments, enough 
younger instructors to do this job. 
</P>
<P>
Shortage of faculty, and of money, stand in the way of creating new, 
experimentalcourses for the CIV series. The expenses created by the earthquake, 
constraints on increases in tuition (which will be $20,210 with room and board 
next academic year) and federal government pressure to reduce the 
administrative payments given to universities for the federal grants they 
receive are squeezing Stanford. It has announced a 13% budget cut -- $22 
million from a $175-million annual base -- over the next 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Thomas A. Wasow, dean of undergraduate studies, said, "We have 
taken the first steps in what I hope will be widespread curricular reform. I 
see developing a multicultural curriculum as one of my goals." The Irvine 
Foundation has given Stanford $1 million to that end, he said. Stanford is 
looking for an Asian-American to teach about the Asian-American experience, and 
it is also seeking someone who can do the same for the African-American. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in curricular ferment," Stanford President Donald Kennedy said. It 
is good to "fumigate the catalogue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Is Stanford undergoing these changes for moral or practical reasons, or for 
both? 
</P>
<P>
"For myself, practical, in the sense that I want Stanford students ready for 
the world as it will be, not as some would like it to remain," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Good High School 
</P>
<P>
In 1959 James Bryant Conant, former president of Harvard University and former 
U.S. ambassador to West Germany, undertook a survey of American high schools 
for the Carnegie Corp. When it was over and published, he said there was one 
sure-fire way of telling a good high school: 
</P>
<P>
"It's where the teachers are excited about doing something new. It doesn't 
really matter what it is, as long as it's new and the teachers are interested." 
</P>
<P>
His remark applies to Stanford, notably to "Europe and the Americas." It scored 
highest of all the tracks in the students' evaluation when it was introduced 
last year. No student questioned for this article found much fault in it, and 
many were enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to be a very concrete thinker. 'Europe and the Americas' helps me 
stretch my mind. The students in this course are very excited about it," said 
Bridget Kaman, who came to Stanford from St. Charles (Ill.) High School. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're studying is like what graduate students are studying," added Casey 
Lynch of Atherton, from Sacred Heart High School in Menlo Park. She was 
referring to what Renato Rosaldo likes to call the "juxtaposition of texts," 
the reading of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," for instance, right after "Democracy in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
"Juxtaposing texts is like juxtaposing colors," Rosaldo had said. "They both 
change by the juxtaposition." 
</P>
<P>
Marya Gilborn of Hunter College High School in New York City said she had taken 
courses in the "great books" and philosophy in high school and liked the 
Stanford course because "I was frustrated by philosophical theory . . . 
studying the origins of justice doesn't seem too important to me as seeing how 
it actually works." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell Mathewson of Lake Washington High School in Seattle said he was 
fascinated by the different points of view brought out by the books they were 
reading and the comments on them from his fellow freshmen of different colors 
and backgrounds, but thought "the origins of justice is important." He 
regretted missing the traditionally taught "great books" and would go back and 
read them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initial Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Which is just the point made by Ronald A. Rebholz, a popular professor of 
English who chairs the "great works" course in CIV and opposed the changes when 
they were made. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like 'Europe and the Americas,' " he said. "It really does slight the 
ancient and medieval worlds to the point where the students are going to be 
ignorant of their cultural and intellectual heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Rebholz was impressed, however, by the reports of student enthusiasm for the 
course. "It's not easy to get freshmen seriously engaged with things," he said. 
"Their lives are so hectic." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the changes, he added to his own course "The Conference of the 
Birds," by Farid ud-Din Attar, a work of medieval Islamic mysticism. "It is 
stunningly beautiful," he said, "and a great addition to the course. I have 
learned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Coope, one of the instructors in the CIV history course, last fall gave 
as one of the new elements in it a lecture on Islamic and Jewish influences on 
Europe. "We got a sense of the tragedy of the destruction of culture," said her 
colleague Mary Weisling. "The students were terribly affected." 
</P>
<P>
"The Stanford students know (because of their diversity) that a sense of the 
values in each culture is so important," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the minority students whose protests helped push the curriculum changes 
to the forefront of the Stanford agenda have graduated. For the moment the 
leaders of the various student minority groups are watching the changes and 
seem to be reasonably content with them. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Minor, a sophomore from Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia and 
co-chairman of the Black Student Union's education rights committee, which was 
the spearhead of the student protest, said that "Stanford has made a commitment 
to multicultural education, and that is fantastic, but the students have to 
keep pushing." 
</P>
<P>
Kennell Jackson, a professor of history lecturing in "Europe and the Americas," 
had said that until recently the black students here had not had a sense of 
"ownership." Do you feel at home here? Minor was asked. 
</P>

Minor wants to "work with people, hopefully in service to the black community. 
You know, lots of people have families at 19." She is thinking about going into 
high school teaching. The leaders of most American universities keep pressing 
on their students the worthiness of public service, even as many students are 
relentlessly careerist.

The Revolution' 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the debate, one of Stanford's luminaries in the humanities, 
history professor emeritus Gordon A. Craig, tolerantly observed that "these 
educational reforms take place every 15 years or so." Craig, a specialist in 
German history and author of "The Germans," was one of the founders of the 
replaced "Western Culture." He and others started it in 1980 because, after its 
predecessor had been thrown out in 1969 in what some teachers call simply "the 
revolution," students needed to know who and where they were. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have any chronological sense. They didn't know whether Jesus or 
Bismarck came first," said Craig (who, with his modified mutton-chop whiskers, 
looks not unlike Bismarck). 
</P>
<P>
Craig, who was reading the Roman poet Tibullus in Latin when his interviewer 
arrived, said he thought "Western Culture" should have been retained, with 
other courses on other cultures, which were essential, added to it. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get down to it, the mainstream of culture (that fed American 
civilization) came from the West," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The matter would be put slightly differently, perhaps, by his next-door office 
neighbor, Keith Baker, the intellectual historian, who came this year from the 
University of Chicago and is teaching the history CIV course, of which his 
history colleague Paul A. Robinson said, "This is the CIV program at its best." 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow Stanford was seen to be caving in to all these forces that seemed to 
some to be overwhelming American values," Baker said. "It wasn't doing that at 
all; it was asking crucial questions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's terribly important to convey to students the way the world -- their world 
-- has been created. It represents human choices, human imagination, human 
conflict. Any introductory course has to do that, because students take so much 
for granted. You have to show them those assumptions haven't always been there, 
that they have been created, and could have been otherwise."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Satellite Dish"] </F>
  [Text] The use of satellite dishes is among the hottest 
subjects being debated in political and cultural circles of this 
country today. 
  Satellite receivers went up on rooftops of Tehran and other 
big cities with amazing speed in the last two years. The use of 
these dishes, in and of itself, does not constitute a 
reprehensible act, and can even be considered useful in 
disseminating news and information on a global level. The 
disturbing aspect of this mass communications device, however, 
is that it is being used by the West to gradually and subtly 
dilute non-Western cultures and change the prevailing social, 
political, and cultural standards of the Third World. 
  The controversy is not confined only to Western and 
non-Western countries. Europe is up in arms against American 
films and television programs that have saturated the European 
screens and air waves. France is considering putting a limit on 
showing U.S.-made films and programs on French television, 
following the failure of American distributors to voluntarily 
cut down their imports to Europe. 
  The Islamic Republic is justifiably concerned with the 
possible negative effects of this phenomenon and is currently 
debating the best way to counter it. Other Islamic countries, 
including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, have already decided to ban 
satellite dishes. But the cultural invasion problem will not be 
resolved by the physical removal of satellite receivers, because 
smaller and more powerful satellite antennae are being built and 
it would be next to impossible to detect them short of searching 
every household in the country. 
  Officials charged with the task of finding the solution to 
this problem should first find out when the new and undetectable 
satellite dishes will reach our markets. If it takes more than 
three or four years, then passing legislation banning the device 
may work for at least a few years in keeping unwanted programs 
from entering our households. But if it turns out that the 
arrival of small antennae in our market is only a matter of a 
few months, then the physical removal of the existing dishes 
will serve only to destabilize the society and will contribute 
to a general feeling of uncertainty among the law abiding 
citizens of the Islamic Republic. 
  The long-term and logical way to combat cultural invasion is 
to improve domestic production of films and radio and television 
programs, thereby removing the incentive to watch Western 
products. After successfully averting the West's cultural 
invasion through producing internationally marketable programs, 
we can export our religious values, culture, and art through the 
same medium of communication to the rest of the world. 
  The natural target of Western media moguls who own these 
global networks are the younger generations of the Third World 
population. Iran should invest in this same generation by 
providing them with a proper education which will emphasize the 
richness and beauty of our culture and Islamic heritage that 
throughout our history has acted as an antidote to poisonous 
foreign cultural invasions.

   In the tumultuous days of China's cultural
revolution, Grace King was exiled to the provinces to work on a
farm. Today, her income is in the ``six figures'' and she owns an
apartment on Manhattan's fashionable East Side.
   Not surprisingly, she has no plans to return to her homeland.
   ``Going back would close off all our possibilities,'' Ms. King
said. ``It would be too much of a sacrifice.''
   Still, Ms. King remains a citizen of China, one of a growing
number of Chinese who have chosen to seek their fortunes in
American businesses and at American universities.
   Sons and daughters of high-ranking Communist Party members, and
even party members themselves, the Chinese came as students, part
of Deng Xiaoping's program of modernization.
   Some are taking jobs to round out their American education,
gaining practical experience that will better enable them to
contribute to China's development once they return home. Others
have become enamored of the United States and have decided to
settle here.
   The largest group af all, however, don't know where they will
end up, torn as they are between appreciation of American freedom
and ties to their homeland.
   Ms. King, 32, arrived in America nine years ago from Beijing.
After graduating from Columbia University with a master's degree in
business administration in 1984, she took a job with Merrill Lynch
as an investment banker.
   Ms. King, the daughter of two high-ranking Communist Party
members, saw her family ripped apart by the ultra-leftist Cultural
Revolution of 1966-1976. Her well-educated parents were purged from
the party, lost their jobs and were kicked from their apartment.
   As part of Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung's program that forced
intellectuals to do physical labor, Ms. King herself was sent to
the countryside to farm. During those years, she spent much of her
spare time in political meetings, hearing harangues against the
capitalism and imperialism of China's then-enemy No. 1, the United
States.
   But then came a rapprochement between the United States and
China, and educational opportunities in America. Ms. King jumped at
her chance.
   ``I'm really happy that I came,'' she said in a recent
interview. ``It gave me a chance to see a different world.''
   Like many of her countrymen who've decided to stay, Ms. King
says she's here for her career.
   ``In China, advancement still doesn't depend so much on talent
and results,'' she said. ``There are other things, like your
attitude, and your political ideology. I can't tolerate that.''
   Leo Orleans, a China scholar at the Library of Congress who is
writing a book on Chinese students in the United States, estimates
that at least 22,000 of the 62,000 who have come here as students
since 1979 have decided to stay.
   That fact, he believes, prompted Beijing to consider slashing
drastically the number of Chinese students allowed in the United
States. Official Chinese documents seen in New York in March
indicated that China has debated cutting the number from around
18,000 in 1987 to 600. But those plans, it appears, have not been
put into place.
   Jerome Cohen, an expert on the Chinese legal system and
modernization drive, sees the mainland Chinese generation in
America as crucial to the country's modernization _ regardless of
whether they return.
   ``These people will help their country no matter where they
are,'' he said. ``It's difficult for a Westerner to understand the
depths of their patriotism.''
   In addition, he said, ``it's vital that the Chinese have people
who know the practice as well as the theory'' _ and that is not
only true in business.
   Hu Quing, a 27-year-old postdoctoral fellow in physics at the
University of California, Berkeley, says the kind of experience
he's getting would be unattainable in China.
   ``Experimental physics requires a lot of equipment and supplies,
and China just doesn't have the resources,'' said Hu. ``Certainly
if I go back I will disappear from the world of academia.''
   Ms. King and Hu say that even if they did return, China, a poor
country with 1 billion people, wouldn't be able to use their skills.
   Liu Ting's father, former Chinese Premier Liu Shaoqi, was the
main target of the Cultural Revolution and died imprisoned and
alone in a hospital in western China in 1969.
   Ms. Liu, 36, came to this country eight years ago and in 1984
became the first woman since Communist China was founded in 1949 to
graduate from Harvard Business School.
   ``The Chinese leaders say they want us to give our lives to help
the country grow,'' said Ms. Liu, 36, who works for Rockefeller
Associates. ``But haven't we given enough? I can see compromising
to help one's country, but never sacrifice.''
   Ms. Liu says she plans on settling here. ``But I may change,''
she said. ``If China continues to open to the West, I may go back.''
   Orleans predicts that in the future, more Chinese will try to
stay.
   ``First, the Chinese are just beginning to realize that America
doesn't just throw people out of the country if they are here
legally,'' he said. ``Even though their government is calling them
back, the students are beginning to understand that they can stay
anyway.''
   The politcal crackdown and official warnings that followed a
recent series of student protests calling for more democracy in
China make America ``look that much better,'' he said.
   Still, some students plan to return, among them Mei Shan, an
analyst with Kissinger Associates with degrees from Harvard Law
School and Columbia's School of International Affairs.
   ``My generation is THE generation that can change China,'' said
Mei, 40, who spent eight years in Inner Mongolia during the
Cultural Revolution repairing farm machinery and now does
geo-political risk analysis for the consulting firm.
   ``We are the only ones who know the country and have expertise.
The younger ones, they may have more desire for democracy or fancy
things, but they don't really have the driving force. They didn't
experience the Cultural Revolution so they have little
understanding of bitterness. For me, the bitterness has been my
strength.''
   Mei acknowledges he is taking a chance in going back to China.
   ``Sure I might not be able to do what I want to do,'' he said.
``But not being in China, even now, I somehow feel guilty.''

<HL> Stanford Would Toss Intellectual Heritage to the Winds </HL>
<AUTHOR> Isaac D. Barchas </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   The intellectual heritage of the West goes on trial at Stanford University today. 
Most predict it will lose. 

   A Faculty Senate debate is to bring to a head a bitter dispute over Stanford's Western Culture course -- this university's version of the Great Books program. 
The Western Culture course is the only requirement at Stanford that ensures its students will study at least some of the great ideas of the West in their historical context. 

   The idea of liberty that defines and animates the world's democracies is a consequence of the Western, intellectual tradition. 
How much longer can we cling to "liberty" (or "justice" or "democracy") when our brightest young people no longer recognize the peculiar conditions, intellectual and historical, that permit it to exist? 
This informed comprehension for higher ideals allows us to speak of "freedom" as something more than, say, a mere Leninist slogan. 

   Instated less than a decade ago in place of a Western-civilization requirement that had been dropped after the 1960s, the Western Culture program, both in time and effort, is Stanford's most significant requirement. 
All entering freshmen must take this yearlong course, incorporating a "core list" of readings including the Bible, Plato, Augustine, Dante and Nietzsche. 

   Now the university's Committee on Undergraduate Studies has recommended that the focus of the course (and its name) change from Western Culture to "Cultures, Ideas and Values." 
The educational mandate is to seek out diversity. 

   The core list of readings would be dropped. 
Individual professors would have discretion over readings, the only constraint being that they include "works by women, minorities and persons of color." 
Moreover, where Western Culture spends one of three terms on the classical period, Cultures, Ideas and Values would emphasize "the last six to eight centuries in particular." 

   A 15-unit requirement lacking a basic list of readings or any structure other than that conveyed by "diverse ideas and values" would be an abdication of the intellectual leadership that students pay Stanford to provide. 
It also would symbolize the low priority that Stanford assigns to "the great works." 
Why is the faculty expected ultimately to choose this path? 
The reasons are only secondarily academic; they are primarily political. 

   The race (white) and sex (male) of the writers on the core list embarrassed Stanford. 
Campus student organizations exploited this embarrassment by labeling the Western Culture program -- and, by association, its supporters -- as racist. 
By abolishing the program, Stanford would adopt, at least tacitly, the stigmatization of the core list and its authors as racist, sexist, insensitive and culturally imperialistic. 

   These claims are repugnant to the academic tradition, to pedagogical responsibility, and to history. 
To claim that classic texts -- such as Galileo's "Starry Messenger," Freud's "Civilization and Its Discontents" or Darwin's "Origin of Species" -- are primarily apologies for the racist or insensitive or imperialist character of their societies, for example, is just plain wrong. 
All the writers now on the core list criticized the societies of which they were parts. 
For their criticisms, some of them were persecuted. 
Some, such as Socrates and Jesus Christ, were killed. 

   Stanford would display a profound disrespect for the texts themselves. 
This disrespect stems from a misguided notion that the core books are only reflections or symbols of something external to the work rather than deeply serious attempts to wrestle with great, human problems. 
This notion comes to the humanities from the social sciences. 

   The tyranny of the social sciences is the crucial factor in allowing political concerns to jeopardize academic ones. 
The impact of Marxism on the academic community illustrates the degree to which social science theories can pervade the academic establishment. 
Marxism and Marxist academics too often confuse the scholarly and the political, or disguise the political with the cloak of scholarship. 

   The current course is sympathetic to the humanities -- students read and think seriously about issues raised by great books. 
In contrast, the new course will be dominated by the social sciences, which emphasize context over text. 
The consequence of this seemingly trivial shift, from text to context, is to give the individual teachers far greater power. 
Any bright student -- and at Stanford, most students are bright -- can read and appreciate Plato. 
Only a professor with a private academic theory, however, can tell the student what the book "really means" in its anthropological or sociological or economic context. 
In this manner, the tyranny of the social sciences removes what shelter an undergraduate has from the temporarily prevailing political or academic winds. 

   The core list, by the emphasis that it places on the books themselves, helps insure that students will be taught by the books with the aid of the professors, and not vice versa. 
Conversely, without the core list the instructors' personal views will likely supersede those of the texts that they teach. 
This is not to discredit the instructors in the course -- they are good teachers, some of the best that Stanford has. 
But Aquinas and Virgil, and the other authors on the core, are better. 

   For if the Western, intellectual tradition has a generally unifying theme, it is that incidental characteristics such as race are irrelevant. 
One's mind, not one's accidental existence, is the true measure of one's worth. 
Plato, for example, rejected an aristocracy based on wealth or birth for one based on intellect. 
What matters is not that one is black or white or male or female, but that one is a human being. 
It is this great belief that gave the civil-rights movement its moral authority; it is this great belief that gives American democracy its intellectual legitimacy. 

   Now the criteria for selection of academic texts would become precisely those incidental characteristics whose significance the Western, intellectual tradition denies. 
Emphasis on such criteria sets a dangerous precedent for our institutions of higher learning, and, by their example, for our culture. 
Moreover, such selection alienates the contemporary, American university from the intellectual tradition it inherits and upon which democratic society is founded.

   Race and Sex on Campus

   Dinesh D'Souza's book, "Illiberal Education: The Politics
of Race and Sex on Campus" (Macmillan/Free Press, 300 pages,
$19.95) might well be subtitled "A Layman's Guide to
Political Correctness on the American Campus." It is a brisk,
hard-hitting, sometimes strident journalistic tour through
the political land mines imbedded these days in higher
education.
   Mr. D'Souza examines the hottest issues in American
colleges and universities. He reviews the affirmative-action
controversy at the University of California at Berkeley;
demands for an Afrocentric curriculum at Howard University,
which are now spilling over into urban school districts; the
debate over censorship policies at the University of Michigan
and other campuses; reform of the curriculum at Stanford to
de-emphasize Western civilization; the "postmodernist" attack
on objective standards of judgment led by the English
department at Duke University; and the rise of politically
correct thought about issues of race and sex on many
campuses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The old-fashioned idea that students go to college to
study the arts and sciences, to hear other views, and to
learn to think critically about issues, Mr. D'Souza suggests,
is in jeopardy. Today, he argues, politically correct faculty
and administrators impose their self-righteous ideology on
hapless students. Instead of hearing different points of
view, they learn that certain views about race, sex,
politics, literature and history are unacceptable.
   "Illiberal Education" presents the conservative critique
of the liberal policies of the past generation. While
liberals would argue, for example, that affirmative-action
policies are necessary to increase the number of minority
students and faculty, Mr. D'Souza holds that such policies
are themselves the root cause of many current controversies.
He argues that affirmative action actually generates racial
tension, because whites resent the special treatment accorded
to blacks, and blacks resent the assumption of academic
inadequacy that preferential treatment implies.
   Mr. D'Souza makes two points that university
administrators would prefer to ignore. First, he points out
the negative consequences of racial preferences. Different
standards of performance applied to different racial groups,
he finds, lead to lower academic standards, self-segregation
among racial and ethnic groups on campus, heightened racial
antagonism, and poor self-concept among minorities. Efforts
to create racial proportionality among students at Berkeley,
he asserts, have lowered academic standards while angering
Asian-Americans, who feel discriminated against by benign
quotas, and outraging whites, who are now an underrepresented
minority.
   Second, he criticizes the nihilism of those in the academy
who are intent on deconstructing the curriculum. He defends
the study of Western civilization, the reading of classics
and objective standards of judgment. He articulately chides
those who admire Third World cultures without examining how
those cultures treat women, gays and other minorities.
   Not that he himself is a paragon of dispassionate
examination on the topic of homosexuality. Like many other
conservative critics, Mr. D'Souza seems to think all
homosexuals are selfish extremists. He does not recognize the
right of homosexuals to protest against discrimination, nor
does he notice that gays do not all speak with one voice.
Gays do not enter colleges through affirmative action or
quotas, nor do they lower academic standards or demand the
dismantling of Western culture. Even though a number of the
classic authors admired by Mr. D'Souza were homosexuals, he
cannot resist seeing all gays stereotypically as part of the
cadre attacking the foundations of education, even
civilization.
   Like any journalistic effort to paint a portrait of a
subject as vast as American higher education, "Illiberal
Education" paints matters worse than they actually are.
Western civilization is still taught and studied, even in the
institutions Mr. D'Souza criticizes. American universities
continue to offer outstanding teaching and research in almost
every field. Yet the trends he describes are real and
troublesome. Scarcely a week goes by without a new
controversy over the issues he describes or new attacks on
the curriculum by political activists.
   Last December, for example, an incident occurred at
Columbia University that could be added to Mr. D'Souza's list
of campus horribles. An associate of Louis Farrakhan was
invited to speak on campus, where he proceeded to denounce
"Eurocentrism," to call for an "Afrocentric perspective" and
to lambaste Columbia "Jewniversity" in "Jew York City." The
college community would react with outrage to racist
statements, but anti-Semitic taunts, as well as academic
nonsense, scarcely attract attention anymore.
   Higher education has not escaped the baneful consequences
of politicization. It is no accident that the public is
indifferent to the budget-cutting that now endangers many
state universities. Nor is it surprising -- as John Agresto,
the president of St. John's College in Santa Fe, N.M., has
pointed out -- that most college students have deserted the
humanities, which have become a battleground for Marxists,
deconstructionists and other esoteric theorists, for the
relative simplicity of business and technical education.
"Illiberal Education" explains why.

   While businessmen have spent the past several years frantically searching for excellence, many literature professors have been just as busy repudiating it. 
"Students are not taught that there is such a thing as literary excellence as they were 20 years ago," says Duke University assistant English professor Joseph Porter. "{We} are throwing out the notion of good and bad, or ignoring it." 

   At many universities, and especially at Duke, where the movement is championed by a corps of academic stars, reading lists are now determined as much on the basis of demographics as on traditional literary standards. 
Professors have de-emphasized the "the phalluscentric canon," in favor of books by women, preferably black women. 
Reflecting the new criteria, Oxford University Press is releasing 30 volumes of works by black female writers of the 19th century this month. 
Contemporary black feminists enjoy even wider popularity. 
"I would bet that {Alice Walker's} 'The Color Purple' is taught in more English courses today than all of Shakespeare's plays combined," the chairman of Pennsylvania State University's English department, Christopher Clausen, has observed. 

   Less obvious demographic groups have also seen their works elevated. 
Duke's Frank Lentricchia teaches an English course titled "Paranoia, Politics and Other Pleasures," which surveys "texts" by Italian-Americans -- Don DeLillo's "White Noise," Mario Puzo's "The Godfather" and Francis Coppola's movies "The Godfather" parts I and II -- to show how organized crime is, according to Mr. Lentricchia, "a metaphor for American business as usual." 

   Prof. Jane Tompkins, also of Duke, studies writers and movie makers of the American West. 
"I'm trying to ask about the novels of Louis L'Amour the same questions that Shakespeare scholars ask of Shakespeare," she says. 
Her recent course in westerns covered the novels of Zane Grey and Louis L'Amour and movies such as "Stagecoach," "The Wild Bunch" and "The Searchers." 
It finished with a look at science-fiction movies and screenplays, including "E.T." and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." 

   "It was probably the most exciting course I've ever taught," she says. 
"Students felt they were doing things they hadn't done before." 

   By market standards, the transformation has been a resounding success. 
The number of undergraduate English majors at Duke is up about 70% over the past five years. 
Graduate-student applications have tripled over the past four years. 
When junior faculty openings at Duke were announced recently, 800 people applied, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. 

   The inclusion of unorthodox "texts" such as Zane Grey novels, movies and even comic books into university literature courses means that students have less and less time to study the older, traditional authors, such as Dickens and Chaucer. 
This is really the point. 

   The movement to open the curriculum without regard to literary quality is called "canon revision." 
Its adherents, who are found in English and comparative literature departments around the country, argue that there is such a thing as a literary canon. 
The term "canon" comes from the Roman Catholic Church, where it denotes an official body of ecclesiastical laws approved by the pope. 
In literature departments, it has come to mean the official works -- by Shakespeare, Twain, Tolstoy, and so on -- as determined, in the words of Duke Prof. Annabel Patterson, "by white, male Northeasterners." 
The suggestion is that these books are used by the powerful to oppress minorities and women. 

   Traditional reading lists, Wesleyan University Prof. and Rockefeller Fellow Richard Ohmann has recently argued, serve "to conceal the real workings of the society from those most hurt by it." 
Recent efforts to reintroduce the traditional Great Books curriculum are, to Mr. Ohmann, part of "a much broader social strategy" on the part of the "professional-managerial class" to enrich and empower the bourgeoisie. 

   As the rhetoric suggests, the movement to revise the canon is an outgrowth of the New Left movements of the 1960s. 
Power struggle and the will to dominate are assumed to be at the heart of all human endeavors, including literature. 
Marx is stood on his head. 
Literature does not reflect material conditions; it creates them. 
Domination, imperialism, racism and sexism are caused by their depiction in the books championed by the white male elite. 

   "The radical views of the late '60s are now divorced from politics outside the university," says Christopher Clausen, a former New Leftist himself. 
"But the New Left has power over curriculum inside the university." 
In fact, the gap between the radicalism of professors' classroom teachings and their relative passivity toward non-academic politics disturbs activist English professors. 
Houston Baker, of the University of Pennsylvania English department says: "Simply because people claim an interest in literary theory doesn't mean they have any political consciousness. 
There might be a black woman getting beaten up and raped by a fraternity in Klan robes, and they would walk on by. 
I don't really find a lot of activist or political consciousness in my colleagues." 

   Revisionists do not claim that these newly introduced authors, Alice Walker or Mario Puzo, are as skillful or brilliant as Shakespeare or Dante. 
Authors' talents or intentions are considered irrelevant. 

   Traditional literary critics believe that certain brilliant authors have created books that illuminate the human qualities, emotions and truths that are innate in all people across culture or the historical moment. 
The emphasis for the traditionalist is to understand the intentions and achievement of the author. 

   For the revisionists, books are not treated as the the work of a single person; they are cultural artifacts. 
"It is cultural conditions that lend value to a work of art," says Prof. Baker. 
Literary excellence, by this view, is window dressing; innate human virtues and eternal truths are nonexistent. 

   Shakespeare is still required of majors in most English departments, but he is usually "contextualized." 
Reading the classics, says revisionist Cary Nelson, of the University of Illinois, is "not so much a search for truth but a search for relevance to a particular culture and time. . . . 
People shouldn't pretend to make eternal judgments." 
Annabel Patterson of Duke is typical. 
She uses Shakespeare, she says, as a vehicle to illuminate the way 17th-century society mistreated women, the working class and minorities. 
This emphasis is called the New Historicism. 

   "You get people teaching autobiographies and political texts in literature departments," says Cary Nelson. 
Ms. Patterson co-teaches a freshman lit course that features "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" by Karl Marx; the writings on the Wolf Man by Sigmund Freud; and the movie version of Manuel Puig's "Kiss of the Spider Woman," about two Latin American prisoners -- one a homosexual, the other a radical. 
What books can reveal, according to the revisionists, are power relationships between elites and the oppressed. 

   By exemplifying the shift among literature professors away from traditional criticism and toward naked and unabashed consciousness-raising, Duke has transformed its English department. 
Unremarkable 10 years ago, it is now widely regarded by English professors as one of the two or three most respected departments in the nation. 

   While other administrations indulge English department fashions simply to avoid trouble and to appear with-it, Duke made its department a top priority. 
In the past five years it has made a series of remarkable personnel acquisitions. 
Stanley Fish, the chairman, was hired along with his wife, Ms. Tompkins. 
Ms. Patterson was recruited from the University of Maryland and her husband, Lee Patterson, from Johns Hopkins. 
Mr. Lentricchia and Fredric Jameson, two of America's most important Marxist scholars, were hired, as were their wives, also English professors. 
Barbara Herrnstein Smith, the president of the massive Modern Language Association and a leading revisionist, was recruited from the University of Pennsylvania. 
In many cases, the salaries that lured these professors were in the six figures. 
Duke put up a new building to house all the incoming talent. 

   It is difficult not to envy the exhilaration these professors so obviously feel as they extend the limits of what can be passed off as an English department. 
But the transformation also is troubling. 
These professors compact the world's great literature to fit their coarse and ham-fisted political framework. 

   Worse, very few of the English professors who dissent from canon revision are willing to go on the record. 
"To disagree," one observed, "is to be regarded like Lester Maddox with his ax-handle." 
Defenders of the Great Books are not part of the debate at many universities. 
Stanford University currently is embroiled in a controversy, described on this page two weeks ago, over whether the traditional Great Books will be replaced on social sciences reading lists. 
In English departments around the country, that battle is nearly over, and no shots have been fired.

<TEXT>
<P>
Six-year-old Carlitos arrived on time for his first day of primary school in 
San Juan, Comalapa, a small town 50 miles northwest of Guatemala City. But 
despite his desire to learn and the full attention he gave his teacher, he 
couldn't understand a word that was said. The instructor spoke only Spanish and 
Carlitos spoke only Kaqchikel. The teaching method was repetition, not 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
Carlitos, who is now 22 and an economist, remembers that "it was like being in 
a box without an escape." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of his classmates had to repeat first grade. Many took two or 
three years to pass each grade until they reached sixth. Many more gave up. 
Although Guatemala is not the poorest nation in Latin America, it is the second 
most illiterate (Haiti is first) and has the second-highest dropout rate. Less 
than 10% of those who enter first grade graduate from sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"The school itself is the source of illiteracy; it is a center of failure, not 
a center of learning," said Mario Leyton, an education consultant sponsored by 
the United Nations Development Program and the U.N. Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization. "It is the scene of a confrontation of cultures." 
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan educational system is going through a radical change with the 
support of the almost 3-year-old democratic government of President Vinicio 
Cerezo. The curriculum from preschool to sixth grade is being transformed to 
respond to the needs of the long-neglected Mayan majority of the population. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayan Indians, more than half of whom do not speak Spanish, are further 
distinguished from the mestizos (mixed Spanish descent) by their darker skin, 
their practice of Mayan religion as well as Roman Catholicism and their 
brightly embroidered, traditional clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than promoting the current cultural confrontation and attempting to 
integrate Mayan children into a dominant Western culture, the new curriculum 
will integrate all children into a Guatemalan nationality that is 
pluri-cultural and respects diversity," Leyton said. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are 23 languages and cultures within Guatemala and further 
diversity throughout the various regions, teachers in each school will have the 
freedom to design a curriculum that responds to the needs of their particular 
community. 
</P>
<P>
For example, students in one region may learn mathematics in terms of 
coffee-growing, the occupation most prevalent in the children's families. 
</P>
<P>
The ambitious project began with $200,000 in seed money from United Nations 
Development Program, the financial motivator for further donations, including 
$1.6 million from the Netherlands, $600,000 from the World Bank and $180,000 
from the United States Agency for International Development, in addition to $1 
million from the Guatemalan government. 
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, teachers from all over the country will have 
participated in the formation of basic but flexible curriculum guides for each 
grade; they will know the language of the students and gradually introduce 
Spanish as a second language while using the native language for instruction in 
the first grade; more participation and practical activities will replace rote 
learning; more visual aids will be used, and the entire process will reflect 
individual community needs, such as classes being held in non-harvest seasons 
when children are not required to work in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons that parents do not keep their children in school. Some 
Mayans see learning Spanish as surrendering to the Spanish conquerors. Others 
lose patience after children repeat the same grade several times. The 
repetition of grades also means a first-grade classroom has students from ages 
6 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
By reducing repetition, the project will make room for more students without 
the need for building new classrooms. At present, the average Guatemalan 
between the ages of 6 and 12 has 2.5 years of schooling; the project hopes to 
raise that to 4 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Success will guarantee economic, social and cultural development of all 
sectors and will thus strengthen the democratic process," Leyton said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The 20th edition of Dewey Decimal
Classification, which assigns numbers to library books, is due out
this year. It's a simple yet sophisticated system for organizing
the world's knowledge, a system that a child can quickly learn.
While it must be updated from time to time, some librarians
maintain that Dewey's system will ``stand for all time.''

<TEXT>
   When Melvil Dewey envisioned how a library
should be organized more than a century ago, he couldn't have
guessed how his system would be tested in the future.
   He could hardly have foreseen in 1873, for example, the
invention of computers, or the spread of AIDS and advancements in
medical science such diseases engender.
   Or the high-speed, low-cost printing presses that turn out so
very many books each year. Since 1979, over a million volumes have
been assigned Dewey Decimal numbers.
   And with the publication this year of the 20th edition of
Dewey's revolutionary system _ the first complete update in a
decade _ just about the only constants of the Dewey Decimal
Classification are its basic structure and its publisher, Albany's
Forest Press.
   But that, after all, was Dewey's vision. The strength and
popularity of the system lie in its adaptability.
   From a slant toward subjects a white, middle-class American male
in the 19th century might study _ European literature, the Bible
and classical philosophy, Romance and Germanic languages, the
natural sciences and history _ the system has assimilated other
literatures and cultures to become the most popular method of
organizing libraries in the world.
   ``Dewey had definitely a white, Protestant, Anglo-Saxon bias.
Over the years, as other editors have worked on the Dewey, there
has been a constant effort to correct for this,'' says Arnold
Wajenberg, principal cataloger and professor of library
administration at the University of Illinois in Urbana.
   Wajenberg, who is also on the advisory committee which oversees
the Dewey's updates, adds, ``There is a very definite United States
bias, Western European bias which is especially damaging as it
becomes a worldwide classification.''
   Familiar to most grade school children, the Dewey Decimal system
is used to organize libraries so books can be found easily. And
reports written, languages learned, curiosity quenched.
   A book is assigned a number to the left of the decimal, placing
it in a general category. To the right of the decimal, it is
assigned numbers that describe the particular book. By adding or
subtracting numbers, a person can find other books on more specific
or general topics. New books can be squeezed into the library's
catalog in the same way.
   The system is sophisticated enough to catalog millions of
volumes and simple enough for a child to quickly learn. So simple
and sophisticated, in fact, that its editor, John Comaromi, says it
will ``stand for all time.''
   ``The thing is, it's powerful, it's really powerful,'' he says.
``It really fits human expression of ideas.''
   Comaromi is head of the Decimal Classification Division at the
Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., where the Dewey numbers
are actually assigned.
   Translated into 34 languages, from German to Gujarati, the Dewey
system is now used in 95 percent of the world's libraries.
   It stands in near-constant transition, with differences in the
two most recent editions illustrating its changing face.
   For example, work began on the 19th edition in 1972. When it was
published, in 1979, crack cocaine was unknown and there was little
published about drugs in general. But as the next decade passed,
information piled up and social attitudes changed, prompting major
changes in the 20th edition. AIDS had the same effect, with its
impact on epidemiology, biochemistry, even sociology, Comaromi says.
   The rapid rise of computer technology even prompted a separate,
between-editions edition, and will prompt future changes in the
system itself, as it is adapted for publication in computer form.
   ``We have this tension between stability in libraries and then
advancement and progress for people using the classification as the
window into knowledge, to the whole world of knowledge,'' Comaromi
says. ``If it's going to be a window into knowledge, it's got to be
current.''
   That's the sole purpose of Forest Press _ keeping the Dewey in
line with what's being published, says executive director Peter
Paulson.
   Paulson, like Melvil Dewey, is a former director of the New York
State Library, one of the first libraries to adopt the system.
   Dewey developed his system in 1873 while a student at Amherst
College in Massachusetts and worked on it the rest of his life.
   In 1911, after resigning his post and moving to Lake Placid,
N.Y., he founded Forest Press, housing it at the Lake Placid Club.
In the early 1970s, the press moved to Albany, and earlier this
year it was purchased by private information-systems giant OCLC of
Dublin, Ohio.
   Although there was at the time neither regular training for
librarians nor a widely used classification system, Dewey based his
system on others, such as the scheme created by former U.S.
Secretary of Education William Torrey Harris for the St. Louis
Public Library earlier in the 19th century.
   While about 200,000 libraries in more than 130 countries now use
the Dewey, other systems compete for attention. Many major research
libraries use the Library of Congress' scheme, the Soviet Union has
its own system, and the Universal Decimal Classification _ derived
in the 20th century from the Dewey _ is popular in Europe,
Wajenberg says. But the Dewey is king for now.
   Its real effectiveness can be seen every time an adult enters
the public library and finds it familiar, years after first
encountering the system. For, as Paulson sums up: ``This is a
system for organizing all the world's knowledge.''

<LEADPARA>  ALTHOUGH NO school was ever purely one type or another, universities before
1910 could be distinguished according to their leading educational ideals:
Harvard was utilitarian, for example; Johns Hopkins, Clark and Chicago were
research institutions. Schools like Princeton and Yale tended to resist both
these trends. But after 1910 (as Laurence Veysey explains in "The Emergence of
the American University") there was a shift.;   Educators stopped arguing
about ideals; the various versions of what properly constituted higher
education were no longer regarded as conflicting. The university learned to
accommodate divergent views of its purpose, and the goal of the people who
administered universities became not the defense of an educational philosophy
but the prosperity of the institution. And the prosperity of the institution
depended on its being, to as great an extent as it found possible, all things
to all people.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Louis Menand teaches English at Queens College and at the Graduate Center of
the City University of New York. He is a Guggenheim Foundation fellow this
year. He wrote this article for Harper's.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     This is how a pedagogical catchall like Introduction to Poetry could come
into being -- a single course on a specific subject expected to serve, all at
the same time, a utilitarian function (by training students how to read and
write), a research function (by preparing future English majors for the
scholarly study of literature) and a liberal arts function (by exposing
students to high culture).;   Even at schools where there is no actual
Introduction to Poetry course, the overall effect of the undergraduate
curriculum is the same. Students in the humanities are expected to major in a
field -- French, say, or religion -- that will provide them with a lot of
knowledge most of which will be useful only in the unlikely event they decide
to enter graduate school and become professors themselves. At the same time,
they are required to fulfill "distribution" requirements designed to expose
them to smatterings of learning in every major area -- with the vague idea
that this contributes to something approximating genuine well-roundedness, and
thus serves a "liberalizing" function. And there is the expectation, now
almost universal, that beyond college lies professional school, for which some
practical training will be useful.;   It's possible to argue that these three
educational functions are only three ways of looking at the same thing, which
is the exposure to knowledge. For higher education in any field certainly can
serve, simultaneously, all three purposes: pure speculation, practical
application and general enlightenment. Even so, there needs to be a consensus
that these benefits are worth pursuing, and that the traditional structure of
the university provides the best means of doing so, in order for the system to
work effectively.;   Three recent developments, none of them having to do
explicitly with politics, seem to me to have undermined this consensus.;  
Changing student population;   The first is the major demographic change in
the undergraduate population during the last 20 years, a change that reflects
both a significant increase in the proportion of people who attend college
(from 1970 to 1988, the percentage of Americans who had completed four years
of college doubled) and a significant increase on most campuses in the
proportion of students who are not white or not male. This means that the
average college class is not the relatively homogeneous group, culturally and
socioeconomically speaking, it once was: The level of preparation among
students differs more widely, and their interests and assumptions differ as
well.;   Since the whole idea of liberal arts education is to use literature
and philosophy as a way of learning how to value one's interests and
assumptions, it is (or it ought to be) obviously absurd to insist that books
that served this function when the audience was predominantly made up of young
middle-class white men can serve the same function now that the audience is
more diverse.;   Critical theory's spread;   The second development putting
pressure on traditional educational ideals is the spread of critical theory as
a kind of interdisciplinary currency in university humanities departments.
Contemporary critical theory -- in particular post-structuralist theories,
emphasizing the indeterminacy of meaning, and ideological theories,
emphasizing the social construction of values -- rejects precisely the belief
on which the professional apparatus of the university (graduate exams,
dissertation defenses, tenure review, publication in refereed journals and so
forth) depends: the belief that the pursuit of knowledge is a disinterested
activity whose results can be evaluated objectively by other trained
specialists in one's field.;   This rejection of the positivistic model of
knowledge production has helped to turn the system of professional rewards,
always an arena for academic politics, into an arena for real-world politics
as well. Critical theorists whose work attacks the traditional premises of
scholarship are invited into humanities departments for the good marketing
reason that their work is where the action is today: Every graduate program
wants a prominent profile. But the system whose principles those professors
teach one another to regard with skepticism remains, except that it has been
thoroughly corrupted. It is now regarded as legitimate by some professors to
argue that the absence of a political intention or a multicultural focus in
another professor's work constitutes a prima facie disqualification for
advancement. And why not, if all scholarship is at bottom political anyway?;  
Degree's value decreasing;   Finally, there has been a change in the role of
college in the preparation of young people for careers outside the academy.
The material value of a bachelor's degree is a function of supply: the greater
the number of people who have one, the less a bachelor's is worth in the
marketplace. Particularly for students interested in "being very well-off
financially" (74 percent, according to the American Council on Education
survey), it has now become imperative not to stop with the bachelor's but to
proceed to professional school.;   This wave of professionalism has
transformed the experience of college. The academic demands on undergraduates
are in a sense now more real, since good grades are essential for getting over
the hurdle to the next degree program; but the content is somehow less real,
since most students now perceive that the education that matters to them will
take place after college is finished. This helps to explain the phenomenon of
the undergraduate whiz in Foucauldian analysis who goes merrily on to a career
in corporate finance.;   These various challenges to the established design of
higher education present difficulties that have little to do with politics.
Perhaps the university will find a way to muddle through them, but muddling
alone is not likely to be very effective. For it is not only a philosophical
idea about education that is being thrown into doubt by these recent
developments. It is also the institutional structure of the university
itself.;   For example, the undergraduate major seems to me an institution
that is at best pedagogically inefficient (why should students going on to law
school have to pass a course of what amounts to pre-professional training for
graduate school in English?) and at worst a contributor to the perpetuation of
an arbitrary definition of knowledge.;   Disciplines a new development;   The
modern academic discipline is only as old as the modern university: Before the
1880s, no one imagined that history, political science, economics,
anthropology and sociology constituted distinct areas of study, each with its
own theoretical and methodological traditions.;   But these distinctions have
become institutionalized in the form of academic departments; the people who
work in those departments have professionalized themselves to keep out
"unqualified" practitioners; and the professions run the fields, monopolizing
both instruction and scholarship.;   A college student today might want, in
four years, to acquire knowledge about American culture, about American
politics and law, and about capitalism. What a student who bothers to seek out
knowledge in these areas is likely to get are courses introducing him or her
to the academic specialties of American studies, political science and
economics. Though there is no reason why every undergraduate should not
receive it, a practical introduction to the law or to business must usually
wait until law school or business school, since that is where the specialists
are. Because there are no instructors who are not certified members of an
academic discipline, there is very little genuinely general education going on
in American colleges.  </TEXT>

   Do Pro-PCers Set Up Straw Persons?

   Katharine T. Bartlett's defense of the "politically
correct" movement on college campuses has a factual
misstatement that's cropping up in many pro-PC arguments --
that the term "politically correct" was invented by the
anti-PC side, as a form of derision (Counterpoint, op-ed
page, June 6). It is indeed being used derisively, but it
originated as a term of mutual congratulation within and
among the denizens of the campus left. I first heard it at
Yale in the early 1980s, as one of several slogans on buttons
worn by feminist leaders.
   Prof. Bartlett's call for debate is undercut by her
intriguing point that all concepts of "neutrality" reflect a
pre-analytical commitment of some kind. It is scarcely
deniable that claims of neutrality often mask
presuppositions, but if neutrality is a null concept, then it
is hard to see how debate can go forward. Debate requires
some agreed-upon core. That core need be no larger than the
elementary rules of logic, yet even these are rejected by
some PC-ers, as reflecting "oppressive" Western rationalism.
No wonder so much "debate" takes the form of antiphonal
sloganeering and organized intimidation.

   Hurrah for Ms. Bartlett] Finally someone refutes the
hysterical attacks on the PC epidemic supposedly threatening
higher education. At the University of Alabama, where I am
employed, I have seen no evidence that PC is anything like
the threat claimed by you and others. I think it's a bogyman
created by those who want the right to be offensive and
insensitive without being made to feel guilty.
   If women, blacks, Hispanics, Arabs, Asians and Africans
are tired of having their feelings and cultures treated as
marginal, the PC critics don't want to hear about it.
   Efforts to introduce sensitivity and balance to campus
life have undeniably led to excesses. But the main point of
these efforts is not, for example, that
Aristotle-Shakespeare-Hemingway should be discarded as
unimportant; it is that writings and ideas from other
cultures are important, too.
   John Gever
   Birmingham, Ala.
   ---
   Ms. Bartlett complains that PC critics attack the
insistence by some "`blacks' and `Indians' that they be
called `African-Americans' or `Native Americans'" and "yet
they take for granted their own titles of `Professor' or
`Doctor' . . . as a matter of simple civility."
   Isn't there a difference, Ms. Bartlett? People earn
academic titles. And when they do, they usually are addressed
with their titles because they deserve the respect of others.
But they would be laughed off campus if they went around
demanding that they be so honored. And when was the last time
a student was threatened with expulsion because he/she wasn't
civil (i.e., failed to use the correct form of address) to a
professor?
   Frank J. Stagnaro

   Ms. Bartlett argues that the critics of "political
correctness" exemplify the academy's real problem. Their
complaints and their assertion that classic literary works
are superior to certain others, are, she says, a "smoke
screen" behind which "those who have power" defend their
"privilege" against the "voices" of women and minorities,
from which there has hitherto been "silence." Thus, she
categorizes authors by sex, race and ethnicity, assumes that
authors so grouped represent corresponding political
perspectives, and substitutes calculations of group interest
for intellectual standards.
   Her position is equally anti-individual and
anti-intellectual. It denies individuals the ability to think
as individuals and reduces the complexity of the Western
cultural tradition to a uniform defense of the status quo.
Her claims that Western civilization courses are in
"alignment" with "points of view . . . dominant . . . in our
society" is patently false; yet Ms. Bartlett, a professor at
Duke Law, assumes its truth without evidence or argument.
This adds up to a thumbnail sketch of "political correctness"
-- a malaise Ms. Bartlett evidently exemplifies. By
construing debate over intellectual issues as a struggle for
power, she unwittingly reveals the root cause of the
academy's new intolerance.

   Ms. Bartlett sets up straw men (straw persons?) and then
tries to knock them down. Her suggestion that PC radicals are
only now being heard as a result of "surplus visibility"
requires us to believe the feminist-left wave on campuses
beginning in the 1960s has been silent up to now. This
requires a willing suspension of disbelief, and requires the
believer to have lived on another planet during this period.
   In times past, the liberal-arts community was more than
hospitable to reappraisals and fresh discoveries. It was
happy to welcome new, contemporary authors, until it was
asked to believe these trendy new authors were possessed of
the kind of genius that put them in a class with the
immortals of literature. They were superior to
dead-white-males such as Shakespeare, Milton and Dante, and
with cries of "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Western culture's got to
go]" sensitive souls like Ms. Bartlett are trying to issue in
the New Age. With apologists like Ms. Bartlett, I am almost
ready to believe the average female Duke student shuns the
label "feminist."

reads:
                                                                                                       

   It's on account of that Magna Charter
   As were signed by the barons of old
   That in England today you can do what you please
   So long as you do what you're told
                                                                                                       

   With the spreading of PC, I suggest the following
modification for Americans:
                                                                                                       

   On account of the First Amendment
   That was signed by some statesmen of old
   In the U.S. today, you can say what you please
   So long as you say what you're told.

<F P=106> [Speech by Dr. Ilyas Farah, official in charge of the </F>
Cultural and Information Bureau of the National Command of the 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, at the Party Preparation School, 
date not given: "The Hope and Challenge Session"] 
  [Excerpts] Dear comrades, students of the Hope and 
Challenge Session. 
  In the name of the Cultural and Information Bureau and on 
behalf of the comrade bureau directors and members, I am pleased 
to extend our congratulations to you on the conclusion of your 
28th session. In as much as it is an occasion to express your 
joy, it is also an occasion to recall your experiences during 
the short period of this course and to conclude lessons for the 
future. [passage omitted] 
  "Hope and Challenge" is the title of a strategy that stems 
from historical awareness of the events in the present phase -- 
crucial events in rare and extraordinary circumstances. This 
historical, principled awareness exposes weak analyses and 
political theories that judge events in the superficial 
traditional way that sees the near and distant Arab future only 
through U.S. and Zionist analyses and the influence of Western 
propaganda. They portray the Arab situation as a vacuum that 
cannot be filled by a nation with history or created by struggle. 
  Therefore, the comrade graduates of this course are called 
upon, now that they have acquired qualitative ideological 
weapons from the spirit of the Mother of Battles, to face these 
political and ideological challenges with historical logic 
backed by scientific thought, struggle spirit, and cultural 
heritage. The speech by the comrade leader on the third 
anniversary of the 30-state aggression crowns all the 
intellectual efforts exerted after the Mother of Battles to 
provide full answers to the questions presented by Arab destiny 
and the national, Arab, and international future. 
  You, comrades, are humanity's vanguard on the path of 
straightening out ideology and cleansing souls and spirits of 
all the corruption in the universe, thereby declaring the 
inevitable downfall of the cultural structure, which lacks moral 
bases and human spirit. You are the builders of a new 
civilization, just as your forefathers were the first builders 
of civilization. As in the dawn of human history, Iraq today is 
a great teacher of history, civilization, and struggle. It is a 
living embodiment of the spirit of the vision, and the immortal 
meanings of patriotism, nationalism, and humanitarianism. This 
is a starting point for a decisive, historical transformation in 
the life of the nation and the modern world. 
  Congratulations to you and to Iraq for alerting mankind to 
the reality of a changing conspiratorial world, foiling the 
electronic war game, and exposing U.S. victory claims by 
preventing the evil 30-station aggression from undermining our 
great principled steadfastness, cultural struggle, and material 
and spiritual reconstruction whose miracles have been achieved 
on the land of Iraq under the leadership of the hero of Iraq and 
the nation comrade leader Saddam Husayn. [passage omitted] 
  Comrades, the theorization taking place today about the 
superior American way of life, "the Zionist era," and "the 
American age" or "Americanism" is only a distortion of 
civilization and an expression of delusions based on half 
truths. This is in addition to its inherent weaknesses, moral 
regression, and cultural alienation . 
  "Americanism", which seeks to generalize the American way of 
life, is founded on three bases: 
  1. Superiority, challenge, and violence as reflected by the 
cowboy mentality, to quote Quincey Wright. 
  2. Bigotry based on race and Protestant religious values. 
  3. Expediency which believes in the relativity of values and 
uses success as a standard for truth. 
  These bases make the American feel he is the master of 
standards. The double-dealing that permeates U.S. morality, the 
exploitation of freedom as applied to money matters and the 
media, and the compromise of values make everything in the 
American way of life, even honor and sovereignty, subject to 
bargain and compromise. Under such pragmatism, life itself 
becomes a series of deals. 
  Thus, war is a deal; peace is a deal; persuading others to 
surrender and accept established facts is a deal;, publicizing 
and marketing liberal democracy and human rights to turn 
political and economic institutions into annexes for the U.S. 
capitalist system is a deal; considering religion, patriotism, 
and nationalism as fundamentalism which must be avoided; 
publicizing Western secularism and internationalist trends; 
opening up fronts against nationalism, Arabism, and Islam; 
advocating common strategies to fight Arab awakening and to 
Americanize and Judaize life in the world are all deals. 
  There is only one starting point for facing this aggressive 
American model which serves Zionist aims: namely, the Mother of 
Battles' spirit, rationalism, renewed unity principles, true 
democracy, and socialism based on lessons learned from world 
experiments which express true human tendencies and address the 
needs of national awakening. The Mother of Battles embodies the 
alternative Arab cultural model which can, in a balanced and 
integrated manner, interact with ideology and technology, 
revolution and wealth, and Man and his humanitarian mission, 
because the Mother of Battles is a spark from the mission's 
spirit, the Ba'thist spirit. 
  You, the sons of the Mother of Battles, have the 
responsibility to build this new cultural model and to defend it 
with intellect, struggle, construction, creativeness and by 
raising the nation's struggle power to the point where it can 
settle the historic confrontation in favor of Arabism and human 
civilization. You are qualified to assume this responsibility. 
I congratulate you and wish you great success in your struggle 
tasks under the principled historical leadership of leader 
comrade Saddam Husayn, may God preserve him. Peace be upon you.

   When Ethnic Studies Are Un-American
   ----

   "What then is the American, this new man?" a French
immigrant asked two centuries ago. Hector St. John de
Crevecoeur gave the classic answer to his own question. "He
is an American, who, leaving behind him all his ancient
prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode
of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the
new rank he holds. . . . Here individuals of all nations are
melted into a new race of man."
   The conception of America as a transforming nation,
banishing old identities and creating a new one, prevailed
through most of American history. It was famously
reformulated by Israel Zangwill, an English writer of Russian
Jewish origin, when he called America "God's crucible, the
great melting pot where all the races of Europe are melting
and re-forming." Most people who came to America expected to
become Americans. They wanted to escape a horrid past and to
embrace a hopeful future. Their goals were deliverance and
assimilation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thus Crevecoeur wrote his "Letters from an American
Farmer" in his acquired English, not in his native French.
Thus immigrants reared in other tongues urged their children
to learn English as speedily as possible. German immigrants
tried for a moment to gain status for their language, but the
effort got nowhere. The dominant culture was Anglo-Saxon and,
with modification and enrichment, remained Anglo-Saxon.
   The melting pot was one of those metaphors that turned out
only to be partly true, and recent years have seen an
astonishing repudiation of the whole conception. Many
Americans today righteously reject the historic goal of "a
new race of man." The contemporary ideal is not assimilation
but ethnicity. The escape from origins has given way to the
search for "roots." "Ancient prejudices and manners" -- the
old-time religion, the old-time diet -- have made a
surprising comeback.
   These developments portend a new turn in American life.
Instead of a transformative nation with a new and distinctive
identity, America increasingly sees itself as preservative of
old identities. We used to say e pluribus unum. Now we
glorify pluribus and belittle unum. The melting pot yields to
the Tower of Babel.
   The new turn has had marked impact on the universities.
Very little agitates academia more these days than the
demands of passionate minorities for revision of the
curriculum: in history, the denunciation of Western
civilization courses as cultural imperialism; in literature,
the denunciation of the "canon," the list of essential books,
as an instrumentality of the existing power structure.
   A recent report by the New York State Commissioner of
Education's task force on "Minorities: Equity and Excellence"
luridly describes "African Americans, Asian Americans, Puerto
Ricans/Latinos and Native Americans" as "victims of an
intellectual and educational oppression." The "systematic
bias toward European culture and its derivatives," the report
claims, has "a terribly damaging effect on the psyche of
young people of African, Asian, Latino and Native American
descent" -- a doubtful assertion for which no proof is
vouchsafed.
   Of course teachers of history and literature should give
due recognition to women, black Americans, Indians, Hispanics
and other groups who were subordinated and ignored in the
high noon of male Anglo-Saxon dominance. In recent years they
have begun belatedly to do so. But the cult of ethnicity,
pressed too far, exacts costs -- as, for example, the current
pressure to teach history and literature not as intellectual
challenges but as psychological therapy.
   There is nothing new, of course, about the yearnings of
excluded group for affirmations of their own historical and
cultural dignity. When Irish-Americans were thought beyond
the pale, their spokesmen responded much as spokesmen for
blacks, Hispanics and others respond today. Professor John V.
Kelleher, for many years Harvard's distinguished Irish
scholar, once recalled his first exposure to Irish-American
history -- "turgid little essays on the fact that the
Continental Army was 76% Irish, or that many of George
Washington's closest friends were nuns and priests, or that
Lincoln got the major ideas for the Second Inaugural Address
from the Hon. Francis P. Mageghegan of Alpaca, New York, a
pioneer manufacturer of cast-iron rosary beads." John
Kelleher called this "the
there's-always-an-Irishman-at-the-bottom-of-it-doing-the-
real-work-approach to American history."
   Fortunately most Irish-Americans disregarded their
spokesmen and absorbed the American tradition. About 1930,
Kelleher said, those "turgid little essays began to vanish
from Irish-American papers. He added, "I wonder whose is the
major component in the Continental Army these days?" The
answer, one fears, is getting to be black, Jews and
Hispanics.
   There is often artificiality about the attempts to use
history to minister to psychological needs. When I encounter
black insistence on inserting Africa into mainstream
curricula, I recall the 1956 presidential campaign. Adlai
Stevenson, for whom I was working, had a weak record on civil
rights in America but was a champion of African nationalism.
I suggested to a group of sympathetic black leaders that
maybe if Stevenson talked to black audiences about Africa, he
could make up for his deficiencies on civil rights. My
friends laughed and said that American blacks couldn't care
less about Africa. That is no longer the case; but one can't
escape the feeling that present emotions are more
manufactured than organic.
   Let us by all means teach women's history, black history,
Hispanic history. But let us teach them as history, not as a
means of promoting group self-esteem. I don't often agree
with Gore Vidal, but I liked his remark the other day: "What
I hate is good citizenship history. That has wrecked every
history book. Now we're getting `The Hispanics are warm and
joyous and have brought such wonder into our lives,' you
know, and before them the Jews, and before them the blacks.
And the women. I mean, cut it out]"
   Novelists, moralists, politicians, fabulators can go
beyond the historical evidence to tell inspiring stories. But
historians are custodians of professional standards. Their
objective is critical analysis, accuracy and objectivity, not
making people feel better about themselves.
   Heaven knows how dismally historians fall short of their
ideals; how sadly our interpretations are dominated and
distorted by unconscious preconceptions; how obsessions of
race and nation blind us to our own bias. All historians may
in one way or another mythologize history. But the answer to
bad history is not "good citizenship history" -- more bad
history written from a different viewpoint. The answer to bad
history is better history.
   The ideological assault in English departments on the
"canon" as an instrument of political oppression implies the
existence of a monolithic body of work designed to enforce
the "hegemony" of a class or race or sex. In fact, most great
literature and much good history are deeply subversive in
their impact on orthodoxies. Consider the American canon:
Emerson, Whitman, Melville, Hawthorne, Thoreau, Mark Twain,
Henry Adams, William and Henry James, Holmes, Dreiser,
Faulkner. Lackeys of the ruling class? Agents of American
imperialism?
   Let us by all means learn about other continents and other
cultures. But, lamentable as some may think it, we inherit an
American experience, as America inherits a European
experience. To deny the essentially European origins of
American culture is to falsify history.
   We should take pride in our distinctive inheritance as
other nations take pride in their distinctive inheritances.
Certainly there is no need for Western civilization, the
source of the ideas of individual freedom and political
democracy to which most of the world now aspires, to
apologize to cultures based on despotism, superstition,
tribalism and fanaticism. Let us abjure what Bertrand Russell
called the fallacy of "the superior virtue of the oppressed."
   Of course we must teach the Western democratic tradition
in its true proportions-not as a fixed, final and complacent
orthodoxy, intolerant of deviation and dissent, but as an
ever-evolving creed fulfilling its ideals through debate,
self-criticism, protest, disrespect and irreverence, a
tradition in which all groups have rights of heterodoxy and
opportunities for self-assertion. It is a tradition that has
empowered people of all nations and races. Little can have a
more "terribly damaging effect on the psyche" than for
educators to tell young blacks and Hispanics and Asians that
it is not for them.
   Belief in one's own culture does not mean disdain for
other cultures. But one step at a time: No culture can hope
to ingest other cultures all at once, certainly not before it
ingests its own. After we have mastered our own culture, we
can explore the world.
   If we repudiate the quite marvelous inheritance that
history has bestowed on us, we invite the fragmentation of
our own culture into a quarrelsome spatter of enclaves,
ghettos and tribes. The bonds of cohesion in our society are
sufficiently fragile, or so it seems to me, that it makes no
sense to strain them by encouraging and exalting cultural and
linguistic apartheid. The rejection of the melting pot points
the republic in the direction of incoherence and chaos.
   In the 21st century, if present trends hold, non-whites in
the U.S. will begin to outnumber whites. This will bring
inevitable changes in the national ethos but not, one must
hope, at the expense of national cohesion. Let the new
Americans forswear the cult of ghettoization and agree with
Crevecoeur, as with most immigrants in the two centuries
since, that in America "individuals of all nations are melted
into a new race of man."

Li Huai once thought she would never have the artistic opportunities she has 
today. Seven years ago the Chinese painter, living in Beijing, was struggling 
to express her feelings about Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution through 
abstract paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Now Li Huai, 34, no longer has to struggle to express her creativity. After her 
1983 marriage in China to Paul Pickowicz, a UC San Diego Chinese history and 
film professor, she took 500 completed paintings and her dreams to the United 
States. Since then, Li Huai has been working out of a studio in La Jolla and 
from June 10 to July 23, 60 of her works will be exhibited at the San Diego 
Museum of Art in a show titled "Li Huai: An Artist in Two Cultures." 
</P>
<P>
In the show Li Huai (her friends call her Li but professionally she uses her 
full name) will offer visitors a contemporary perspective of the contrast 
between Western and Chinese artistic cultures. The paintings reflect the impact 
of the Cultural Revolution, which stifled her modern, avant-garde style 
paintings, as well as her classical Confucian training, which she began at age 
7 with traditional Chinese calligraphy lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty of the 60 paintings were done in China. They were all banned during the 
Cultural Revolution," said Li Huai. Five of the paintings are a series of nudes 
done 10 years ago. "Even now these would be considered immoral," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were thought of as bourgeois -- decadence," said Pickowicz. 
</P>
<P>
Li Huai, her husband and their 4-year-old daughter, Natasha, now live in 
Valencia, where she is in the Master of Fine Arts program at CalArts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rare to see someone come out of one culture and adapt so readily to 
another. But Li made an incredible adaptation to art in the U.S.," said Millie 
Wilson, director of programs and art at CalArts. "She is a phenomenal painter 
even without her bicultural background -- and produced an amazing art 
installation." If she was not in the United States, she would be doing 
remarkable things in China, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As Li Huai sat in her Valencia home, she remembered what it was like when she 
first arrived in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I had so much energy. Suddenly I could use color, form and content I never 
could use before. Suddenly I could work on problems that I wanted to paint 
about while I was still in China." 
</P>
<P>
"Li was like a person dying of thirst," said Pickowicz, also remembering those 
first few years. Except it was a thirst that could not be quenched in just a 
few days -- it took three years. Li worked day and night to finish up the 
agenda that she could not complete in China." 
</P>
<P>
The best example of this "burst of energy" is work No. 51 in the exhibit, said 
Pickowicz. The painting, "Ferule," consists of 52 individual panels. Each panel 
tells a separate tale of the human holocaust of the Cultural Revolution, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Many people think that Chinese artists come to America and immediately paint 
American things, said Pickowicz. Not Li Huai -- she had too much else on her 
mind, he said. "She had to come to terms with the Revolution first." 
</P>
<P>
Other people think that all Chinese artists either paint bamboo and birds, 
exotic landscapes, or 19th- and early 20th-Century art being produced in China. 
It is much harder to be judged in terms of global art, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Li Huai does not want to be stereotyped as a Chinese artist or an American 
artist for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to be regarded as part of the critical art world," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly all preconceptions about Li Huai are dropped as soon as visitors 
enter her studio. 
</P>
<P>
"They may walk in hoping to see only charcoal drawings of exotic landscapes 
done on rice paper," said Pickowicz. "And they do see this. But they also come 
out of her studio shaken up -- for the better." 
</P>
<P>
"Salted Fish," for instance, brings together traditional Chinese culture and 
the struggle to reach beyond the Chinese social context, the artist said. In 
the painting Li Huai uses dark grays, blacks and hand-painted white words, 
telling the ancient folk story about Chinese salted fish. She said the 
painting, different from anything she has created before, is her way of showing 
the complex web of connections among people in China. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese do not just have to learn from Americans, but Americans have to 
learn from the Chinese, said Li Huai. "It's a two-way street." 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are now becoming interested in Modernism, but they are still way 
behind Western art. They have no idea about Postmodernism," she said, pointing 
out that when she finishes her studies at CalArts she wants to actively help 
inform Chinese artists and art students about what is going on in the art world 
outside China. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the artist and her husband are planning to take 20 American art and 
film students to China next summer. Through an agreement with the University of 
California and the Beijing Film Institute, where Li Huai did her undergraduate 
studies, the couple are planning to lead a four-week seminar on the resurgence 
of Chinese cinema in the '80s and the extent to which it draws inspiration from 
traditional and foreign themes.

   Sheep now feed off grass and overgrown
weeds covering millions of bunkers that were built years ago to
seal off Albania. Today, the fight against the world's ``corrupting
effects'' takes a different form.
   Western culture, although carefully monitored by bureaucrats and
intellectuals, seeps through the increasingly porous borders of
Europe's most isolated nation.
   Western ideas contrast sharply with Albanian orthodoxy but there
is little open evidence of any grass-roots disaffection threatening
to topple the last European refuge of Stalinism.
   Reports of anti-communist riots in the northern city of Skhoder
in January apparently were unfounded. Officials here charge they
were fabricated by the state-controlled media in Yugoslavia, which
is at odds with Albania over the fate of millions of ethnic
Albanians in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
   ``We do not want to assimilate; we want to preserve our national
identity,'' said Ymer Minxhozi, general secretary of the Albanian
Union of Journalists.
   ``We have no homosexuality, no prostitution, no drugs and no
black market,'' he told a group of visiting Western journalists.
   The bunkers, first built during World War II to guard against a
land invasion, were vastly expanded after the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact marched into Czechoslovakia in 1968. Now they are falling into
disuse.
   No one knows exactly how many bunkers there are, but one
official estimated at least one for every Albanian _ 3 million.
   ``The bunkers in Albania do not move ... they have no feet or
wheels. They do not threaten anyone,'' Deputy Foreign Minister
Socrat Placa said in an interview.
   During its 45-year history as a Stalinist state, Albania has had
little to do with the world beyond its borders. It still reveres
the memory of Josef Stalin and adheres strictly to Marxist-Leninist
doctrine.
   Albania cut ties with the Soviet Union in 1961 because of its
de-Stalinization program and with China in 1978 because of China's
perceived deviation from Marxist-Leninist policies after Mao
Tse-tung's death.
   Enver Hoxha, the founder of the communist state in Albania, died
in 1985, but his policies and personality cult survive. A Hoxha
museum opened last year, a marble and glass temple among Tirana's
dilapidated and windowless buildings.
   Hoxha's successor, Ramiz Alia, is credited with introducing some
openness and acknowledgement of deficiencies of the Albanian
system. Mistrust and hostility toward Moscow and Washington remain,
however.
   Placa made no effort to disguise his satisfaction when he heard
a Western news report on a visiting reporter's radio of an
explosion at a Soviet military base in Czechoslovakia.
   ``Good, good, very good. ... Of course it may have some
consequences but is a good lesson for Gorbachev,'' Placa said.
   Nevertheless, Placa said, discussions were under way to further
increase ties with ``both East and West.''
   Albanians are able to view Italian, Yugoslavian and Greek
television. Scrawled on a shutter of a backstreet shop in Tirana
were the words, ``IRON MAIDEN,'' a leading British heavy-rock band.
   In another part of town, someone had repeatedly written ``liri''
(freedom) on a kiosk wall, an uncommon slogan in a country with a
powerful secret police, the Sigurimi.
   Activities of the Sigurimi were assailed last year, however, in
a best-selling novel by writer Neshat Tozaj, who works as a
criminal investigator in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
   The novel, ``Thikat'' (Knives), portrayed the Sigurimi as
falsifying evidence and making illegal arrests and detentions.
   Publication of a book exposing abuses of the secret police could
indicate a relaxation of censorship or, as some Western observers
suggested, a power struggle to restrict the Sigurimi.
   ``The artistic qualities of the book were criticized but it
touched on certain themes in our society. ... Life must be
reflected in literature,'' said Nasi Lera, secretary of the
Albanian Union of Artists and Writers.
   Authorities still want to stop controversial material about
Albania from reaching abroad.
   Visiting Finnish television journalists found on their return
home evidence of tampering with an interview with Foreign Minister
Reiz Malile, which had been filmed by a local crew.
   Malile had acknowledged on camera that Albania had some
political prisoners but added, ``It's not a problem.'' That section
of tape was replaced by a segment of an Albanian song contest.
   Modern Western literature is translated into Albanian, and
William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Saul Bellow and Truman Capote
are better known than Spanish, Italian or French writers, said
Ismail Kadare, Albania's best-known modern author.
   ``We don't approve of pornography ... and our greatest problem
is mediocrity. But that's a worldwide problem,'' Kadare added in an
interview.
   ``The West definitely has a corrupting influence ... even though
we must respect them for their marvelous scientific achievements
and progress,'' a 21-year-old woman said.
   She added she would like to go abroad in a student exchange
program, then said, ``But things are so good here.''

   It is difficult, and even dangerous, to talk candidly
about "multiculturalism" these days. Such candor is bound to
provoke accusations of "insensitivity" at least, "racism" at
worst.
   Even some of the sharpest criticisms of multiculturalism
are content to limit themselves to demonstrating how
"illiberal" it is, how it violates traditional ideas about
the substance of liberal education, and how it represents a
deplorable deviation in the way our young Americans, so
heterogeneous in their origins, are to be educated to live
together. This criticism is certainly valid and welcome. But
it also implicitly concedes too much by going along with the
assumption that there really is such a thing as
multiculturalism -- i.e., a sincere if overzealous effort by
well-meaning educators to broaden the horizons of the
conventional curriculum. Such educators doubtless exist, but
their efforts end up being the victims of a far more
aggressive mode of multiculturalism.

<TEXT>
   Though the educational establishment would rather die than
admit it, multiculturalism is a desperate -- and surely
self-defeating -- strategy for coping with the educational
deficiencies, and associated social pathologies, of young
blacks. Did these black students and their problems not
exist, we would hear little of multiculturalism. There is no
evidence that a substantial number of Hispanic parents would
like their children to know more about Simon Bolivar and less
about George Washington, or that Oriental parents feel that
their children are being educationally deprived because their
textbooks teach them more about ancient Greece than about
ancient China.
   To the degree that there is any such sentiment in these
minority groups, it can be coped with in the traditional way
-- by a few hours a week of after-school instruction for
their children, privately arranged. (At the college level, of
course, instruction in the relevant languages, literature,
and history has always been available.) But most adult
Hispanics and Orientals do not have any such concern. They
are fully preoccupied with the process of "Americanization."
The "roots" these groups seek are right here in the U.S., not
among the Aztecs or in the Ming dynasty.
   Most Hispanics are behaving very much like the Italians of
yesteryear; most Orientals, like the Jews of yesteryear.
Because of differences in cultural background, their
integration into American society proceeds at different rates
-- but it does proceed. The process is not without pain and
turmoil, but it works. Ironically, and sadly, it has not
worked so well for American blacks, among the earliest
arrivals. Hence, out of desperation, the turn to
multiculturalism.
   Multiculturalism comes in varying kinds and varying
degrees of intensity. A child may come home from elementary
school knowing more about Harriet Tubman than about Abraham
Lincoln. This can be disconcerting to white parents and
baffling to Hispanics or Orientals, but presumably they can
shrug it off as a transient phenomenon. The question is: Do
such trivial pursuits of worthy but relatively obscure racial
ancestors really help black students? There is no evidence
that it does. In theory, it is supposed to elevate their
sense of "self-esteem," as individuals and as blacks. But
genuine self-esteem comes from real-life experiences, not
from the flattering attention of textbooks.
   In fact, as is well known by now, the problems of young
blacks do not arise in our schools, nor are they remediable
there. They are the product of their homes and environments
-- a terrible social problem, not an educational problem. But
this does not prevent our overly ambitious educational
establishment from engaging in a pretense of offering
"solutions." In addition to promoting self-esteem among young
blacks -- our white students already have a wildly inflated
notion of their academic capabilities, as researchers have
demonstrated -- it seeks to promote appropriate "role models"
in the school. "Role models" and "self-esteem" are now
crucial terms in the psychobabble of the educational world.
   Actually, hiring more black male teachers is a good idea.
But it has nothing to do with the provision of role models.
Just as fathers in the home are very important as a source of
moral authority, so black male teachers can be a useful
source of authority in the school -- especially when the home
has no father. They can help make a school a more orderly and
decent place. But just as fathers play their part without a
thought of being role models, so do black male teachers play
an equivalent part.
   Role models are largely a sociological fantasy. We all,
when young, have known (or have known of) adults whom we
respected and admired -- until, with time, their images fade
as our interests shift. Very few of us have gone through life
gazing at role models we have known. And, unfortunately,
there is as yet little evidence that black teachers have a
significant, differential effect on the academic achievements
of black students.
   It is in its most intense and extreme form, however, that
multiculturalism is on its way to being a major educational,
social and eventually political problem. This version is
propagated on our college campuses by a coalition of
nationalist-racist blacks, radical feminists, "gays" and
lesbians, and a handful of aspiring demagogues who claim to
represent various ethnic minorities. In this coalition, it is
the blacks who provide the hard core of energy, because it is
they who can intimidate the faculty and the administration,
fearful of being branded "racist." This coalition's
multiculturalism is an ideology whose educational program is
subordinated to a political program that is, above all,
anti-American and anti-Western.
   It is no exaggeration to say that these campus radicals
(professors as well as students), having given up on the
"class struggle" -- the American workers all being
conscientious objectors -- have now moved to an agenda of
ethnic-racial conflict. The agenda, in its educational
dimension, has as its explicit purpose to induce in the minds
and sensibilities of minority students a "Third World
consciousness" -- that is the very phrase they use. In
practice, this means an effort to persuade minority students
to be contemptuous of and hostile to America and Western
civilization as a whole, interpreted as an age-old system of
oppression, colonialism and exploitation. What these radicals
blandly call multiculturalism is as much a "war against the
West" as Nazism and Stalinism ever were.
   Under the guise of multiculturalism, their ideas -- whose
radical substance often goes beyond the bounds of the
political into sheer fantasy -- are infiltrating our
educational system at all levels. (On this page yesterday,
Michael Meyers explored -- and deplored -- the preaching of
some of these ideas by the "Africanists.") Just as bad money
drives out good, so the most intense versions of an ideology
tend to color and shape the less intense.
   It is now becoming ever more common within the American
educational system for increasing numbers of young blacks to
learn that what we call "Western civilization" was invented
by black Egyptians and feloniously appropriated by the
Greeks, or that black Africa was a peaceful, technologically
advanced continent before the white Europeans devastated it.
Such instruction can only inflame an already common belief
among blacks that "white America" and its government are
deliberately fostering drug addiction and diabolically
tolerating the AIDS virus in the black community.
Multiculturalism, as its most ardent proponents well
understand, is a technique for "consciousness raising" by
deliberately stroking this kind of paranoia.
   One does not wish to be apocalyptic -- though thoughtful
and honest teachers may be forgiven for thinking their world
is coming to an end. Most of those who tolerate or even
advocate multiculturalism in our schools and colleges have
educational, not ideological, intentions. But the force is
with the extremists, who ride roughshod over the opposition
by intimidating it with accusations of "racism." So the
opposition timidly makes concession after concession, while
seeking shelter in anonymity.
   Recently, a journalist telephoned five leading professors
of Egyptology, asking them what they thought about the claim
of a black Egyptian provenance for Western civilization. They
all said it is nonsense. At the same time, they all withheld
permission for their names to be attached to this risky,
"politically incorrect" position.
   There is no doubt that today, multiculturalism is
beclouding and disorienting the minds of tens of thousands of
our students -- mainly black students. It is not an
educational reform. It is an educational -- and an American
-- tragedy.

      {Part of a Series}
   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Sandwiched between Pierre Cardin sport shirts and Ralph Lauren toiletries at the Sarinah Department Store in downtown Jakarta is a happy little place called the Moslem Corner. 
Sales girls, some wearing makeup, giggle while offering lace shawls, religious cassettes and other Islamic paraphernalia to passers-by. 
Visa and American Express cards gladly accepted. 

   "But I'm Catholic," says an Australian browser. 
"No problem," the clerk replies, offering a souvenir shirt with a "Moslem Corner" label. 

   Islam is different in the world's largest Moslem nation, Indonesia. 
It has a sense of humor. 
It doesn't seem so stern and insistent. 
It is more tolerant than Islam elsewhere. 

   Patrols don't roust amorous young couples out of park bushes here as they do in neighboring Malaysia, where government-sanctioned Islamic zealotry is part of its goal of lifting Moslem ethnic Malays to the economic level of ethnic Chinese. 

   Nor are Islamic militants at war with the government here, as in the southern Philippines, where they have been battling Catholic interlopers for 350 years. 

   The Moslem fundamentalists of Indonesia have already fought their wars. 
And they have lost, first to Dutch colonialists and then to successive regimes of nationalists who have beaten down, co-opted, divided, arrested, jailed and sometimes executed them, in the belief that forming an Islamic state would destroy the Indonesia painfully fused from a melange of ethnic, cultural and religious groups. 

   In effect, says Jusuf Wanandi, the director of Jakarta's Center for Strategic and International Studies, the campaign against politicized Islam has ended in a deal: Moslems agreed that theirs would be social-religious organizations instead of political ones, and "what they got in return was the government, military, and intelligence apparatus off their backs." 

   As the government sees it, by encouraging Islamic spiritual values within a nationalist outlook, Indonesia may be pioneering Islam's role in the 21st century as a modern, progressive religion instead of one always reaching for the past. 

   The government-approved Moslem leaders here profess to like the arrangement too. 
Instead of always contesting for political power (and losing), they say, Islam now is free to do what it had neglected here for years -- grass-roots propagation. 

   By all appearances, it is doing that in a big way. 
What happens at noon on Fridays in the villages of central and east Java amazes some anthropologists: Freshly scrubbed children and young adults don clean shirts and sarongs, drape prayer rugs over their shoulders and walk or bike to small, unpretentious mosques. 
Most of the elders stay home to tend their houses or rice fields. 

   In the cities too, young people are flocking to prayer. 
Congregations in Jakarta, the capital, are about 80% teen-agers and young adults, many of them from the middle class and well-educated. 

   Why? 
The answer may be simply that the Suharto government requires two hours of religious instruction a week for all students from kindergarten through college. 
Moslems learn Islam, Catholics Catholicism, and so on. 
It is the government's way of encouraging morality and showing that while it isn't an Islamic state, it isn't a secular one, either. 

   But scholars say the causes are much deeper. 
Contrasts of wealth and poverty are increasingly sharp in Indonesia, and middle-class children are developing a social consciousness akin to that of young Americans of the 1960s. 
Islam offers an umbrella for them to protest corruption, a government top-heavy with generals, a pervasive intelligence apparatus and policies that stifle dissent. 

   Moreover, in Indonesia as well as in Malaysia, a wave of Western influences, capital, culture and values has caused a backlash, not unlike China's distress over "spiritual pollution." 
Amid drugs, pollution, pornography, greed and lawlessness, young Indonesians -- especially those who have studied abroad -- find much in Western society that is sick and disturbing. 

   Returning from the culture shock of education in the U.S. or Europe, students feel like misfits. 
Writes M. Nasir Tamara, a journalist who has studied the phenomenon: "Frustrated, they have turned to Islam, not so much for economic reasons as to search for an answer to the emptiness in their souls, to the alienation from their own society." 

   Islam seems to them an indigenous religion rather than something imported from the capitalist West or communist East. 
It makes them feel "comfortable," the youngsters say, even "happy." 
It offers a feeling of identity and peace -- a feeling many young adults remember their villages providing before modernization marched in. 
They remember the coziness and family security, not the poverty. 

   Thus is a new generation of Indonesian Moslems growing up devout -- nearly five centuries after Mohammed's message reached a place already saturated with Hindu gods, Buddhist spirits and animist ghosts. 

   Islam, with its string of losing struggles for political power here, never overcame the fact that Hindus and Buddhists got a six-century head start and mysticism even more of one. 
It has remained a veneer despite all its attempts to impose its will through rebellion and the ballot box. 
Indonesia has never been dominated by Islam in the manner of Saudi Arabia or Iran, though it has three times as many Moslems as either of those countries. 

   And it isn't like them in another way. 
While the Middle Eastern nations aren't exactly homogeneous, they are like clones compared with Indonesia's diversity: some 300 ethnic and tribal groups speaking 150 languages and dialects, containing not only the Moslems but also seven million Christians, three million Hindus, Buddhists, animists and all sort of combinations of the above. 
This mixture is sprinkled across 6,000 of the country's 13,667 islands, some the size of France, others the size of Manhattan apartments. 
Out of the country's population of 168 million -- the fifth largest in the world -- 147 million are professed Moslems, primarily Sunnis. 

   Indonesia's post-colonial struggle against Islamic fundamentalism began as World War II was ending, when a nationalist leader named Sukarno introduced an ideology called Pancasila. 
A vague monotheistic and humanitarian creed, it had nothing special for Islam. 
Moslems wanted a constitution requiring members of their faith to practice Islamic law. 
They lost. 
The nationalists proclaimed independence. 

   Between 1948 and 1953, Moslem rebels proclaimed Islamic states in West Java, South Sulawesi and North Sumatra. 
Intermittent shooting wars against them didn't cease until 1959. 
Many of today's Indonesian leaders fought in those wars, and they have kept a close eye on Moslem leaders ever since. 

   "Would somebody please tell me what all this blather is about an Islamic state?" 
That would be a blasphemous question in parts of the Islamic world, but not here. 
The man who asks it is Munawir Sjadzali, Indonesia's minister of religious affairs. 
Over tea in his living room in a Jakarta suburb, he talks not personal opinion but government policy: Islamic spiritual, moral and social values -- no problem. 
Islamic rule -- no way. 

   "When I was young," he said, "I was attracted to the idea of an Islamic state. 
I did my thesis on it. 
I entered the library with a blank mind. 
I came out with a conclusion: You can find a code of political ethics in Islamic teachings and history, but you can't find a political system. 
You show me a so-called Islamic state and I'll show you something else." 

   In the midst of the global Islamic resurgence three years ago, the Suharto regime officially de-Islamized politics. 
The government brutally put down a riot fueled by Moslem leaders, then ordered all organizations to swear allegiance to the state ideology. 
Now the government builds mosques and provides funds for Moslem schools and organizations, but it brooks no political ambitions. 

   Critics say it exaggerates the threats of both militant Islam and remnant communism to justify harsh curbs on dissent. 
"The most votes Moslem parties ever got was about 45% in the 1955 election," says Slamet Bratanata, a one-time mining minister. 
"Indonesia has too many 'statistic Moslems.' 
By way of the ballot box, they would never get an Islamic state." 

   But Abdulrahman Wahid, the director of the country's most powerful Moslem organization, Nadhatul Ulama, says he likes the setup that leaves Islam free to pursue anything except power. 
"We can have a bigger role in the future because when someone speaks for Islam now, he isn't taken to be threatening the ruling party's existence," he says. 
"We don't present ourselves as an alternative institution." 
Not at the moment, anyway. 

   Islam is especially important these days, Mr. Wahid figures: "The younger generation is trapped between the need to preserve traditional values of family and Islam and the attraction of the materialist life of the West. 
Our job is to prepare our members for an era of industry in a modern world without losing our religious values." 

   The values, he adds, are more important than the institutions. 
"We're trying to connect the tradition of Islamic heritage with the future. 
Indonesia is the first test case of real reconciliation between Islam and a national ideology." 

   This is the kind of stuff the Indonesian government doesn't mind hearing. 
Mr. Wahid is a charming, erudite scholar who studied at Al Azhar in Cairo and at the University of Baghdad. 
And he has access to President Suharto -- which makes militants charge that he isn't his own man. 

   He stresses "rational thinking" for a modern world and emphasizes in speeches the need to address problems of development, legal services and social justice. 
These might well be the issues of a political opposition, but in Indonesia today, they are to be discussed solely for the propagation of the faith. 

   Malaysia tries to build bridges to the Middle East to deepen Moslem-world connections, but Indonesia doesn't. 
Envoys of Libya or the Palestine Liberation Organization aren't welcomed here. 
Jakarta says undergraduates can study at Moslem institutions in the Middle East, on their own, but not graduate Moslem scholars. 
They must go to Western universities like the University of Chicago, where, it is felt, the best Islam studies are today. 

   "We are in need of thinking Moslems," says Harun Nasution, a 67-year-old Moslem scholar at the government-sponsored Institute for Islamic Studies. 
"We send students to Al Azhar and to Mecca, and they come back with a lot of memorizations. 
They don't understand society or real life. 
Our students have to learn rational thinking in order to have Islam accepted by today's intellectuals. 
It's already accepted by the common people. 
We are trying to make Islam acceptable to the ruling class." 
He adds: 

   "We don't want to reject the past, but rather to orient to the future. 
Indonesia is more free than other Moslem countries to do this. 
They continue to look back to a golden age. 
We didn't have any golden age." 

   Indeed, Indonesia is the only Moslem-majority country that fought a revolutionary war for its independent nationhood. 
It has paid dues, and most older Indonesians remember them. 

   Most Islamic countries either remain rooted in agrarianism or else tried to modernize simply by pumping oil. 
As Texans say, you don't have to be smart to get rich by pumping oil, and you don't have to learn much, either. 
With its huge poor population, Indonesia has had to struggle slowly to modernize. 
The Suharto government isn't ashamed of the results. 

   The question is, Has it given Islam enough space, or is its lid on political expression like a cap on the dormant volcanoes forming the spine of this archipelago? 
Will pressure build and eventually explode? 
It's hard to say. 

   "You always find that when the "ulemas" {Moslem teachers} withdraw from the state and go back to socializing approaches, the Islamization of society has come back to haunt," says Taufik Abdullah, a scholar at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences. 

   That is what happened in 1965. 
Before its abortive coup that year, the Indonesian Communist Party, known as PKI, was the largest outside the old Sino-Soviet bloc. 

   "In '64 and '65, you'd have to say you were living in a Communist country here," says a Western diplomat who lived here then. 
"This place had the look, the feel, the smell of a Communist state. 
Yet four days after {the coup attempt}, Moslem students were burning down the PKI headquarters." 

   Mr. Abdullah was a student leader in those days. 
"Red flags were flying everywhere," he says. 
"But we knew that it was only a facade and that Moslems would put it down."

<P>
While the Soviet Union struggles to control ethnic strife in its republics of 
Azerbaijan and Armenia, Iran to the south faces as great a threat from the 
challenge of nationalist separatism along the Soviet-Iran frontier. The crucial 
factor is that the local peoples involved are on both sides of the border -- as 
disaffected from Tehran as they are from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet and Iranian empires are similar. The ruling people inhabit a central 
area, with subordinate peoples of different race or language or religion -- or 
all three -- around the periphery. Ignoring these differences, Farsi-speaking 
Persians of central Iran until recently have been using the Islamic appeal in 
propaganda aimed at the brothers or cousins of its frontier peoples on the 
other side of the border, to subvert their loyalty or destabilize the communist 
system. 
</P>
<P>
On Iran's northern border, these transfrontier peoples are the Azerbaijanis -- 
or Azeris, as they are usually called, plus the Turkomen and Uzbeks; on the 
southern and western periphery are the Baluchis, Arabs and Kurds. Except for 
the Azeris, who have Shiism in common, (though as many as 30% are Sunni 
Muslims), all these peoples differ from Persians in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
Whether from land hunger or because of family and communal links, the Soviet 
Azeris have been tearing up frontier fences in the last few weeks. Their 
original demand was for easier access to relatives and to Shiite shrines across 
the Araks River; this then hardened into a demand for permanent opening of the 
frontier. In short, they wanted the sort of arrangement that has been 
implemented between the two Germanys. But then an extremist Azeri group, 
National Salvation, asked for a separatist state of Iranian and Soviet 
Azerbaijanis, to include the border enclave of Nakhichevan. Their demand 
stressed the Islamic link, and some publications in Tehran also spoke of this 
urge for "Islamic unity" as a triumph for Iran's pan-Islamic propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
These few references apart, official reaction of the mullahs' regime in Tehran 
to the Azeri actions has been decidedly ambiguous. After an initial period of 
puzzled silence, the Iranians called upon the Soviets to keep their Azeri 
citizens under control. Then when the Soviet Azeris assembled on a northern 
bank of the Araks, the Iranians, using loudspeakers from the other bank, 
advised them to contact their local authorities so that visits could be 
properly arranged. There was no exploitation of the Islamic brotherhood theme 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranians went further, commending the restraint of Soviet frontier guards 
who had helped "in checking the overexcitement of the Muslim Soviet 
Azerbaijanis." One skeptical Iranian official even described Azeri agitation as 
the triumph of nationalism over reason. After emergency talks in Moscow, both 
sides have presented the frontier situation as a simple problem in tourism that 
called for an administrative solution. 
</P>
<P>
Why, after a decade of excited, subversive propaganda, have the mullahs adopted 
this low-key, even discouraging, attitude just when the propaganda seemed to be 
producing results? One factor is that the sub-religion of nationalism is 
anathema to propagators of a universalist faith like Islam (or communism). And 
nationalism leading to a local separatist movement is not only wicked but 
dangerous, especially for Iran with its numerous restive frontier peoples. 
Hence, while the use or teaching of the Azeri language (a simple form of 
Turkish) has not been banned in Iran as has Kurdish, its use has been 
discouraged by Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, ever since the so-called Islamic revolution, Tehran has felt the 
need to keep a particularly suspicious and watchful eye on the Azerbaijan 
region. Azeris, led by Ayatollah Kazem Shariat-Madari, played a part in 
overthrowing the shah, but soon afterward rejected Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini's key doctrine of velayat-e-faqih, the semi-divine right of the 
clerical caste to rule. Eventually Shariat-Madari was stripped of his clerical 
role, accused of treason and placed under house arrest for life. This 
humiliation offended the Azeris, who still revere their ayatollah; force has 
had to be used to suppress Azeri dissidence. The mullahs certainly do not want 
to see any swelling of the numbers of troublesome Azeris, who have been talking 
of an Azeri nation-state separate from both the Soviet Union and the Islamic 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has confirmed that the dissidents in 
Azerbaijan are striving for an independent Islamic republic that would unify 
Soviet and Iranian Azeris. This would be the last thing the Tehran regime would 
want -- a separate source of Islamic power, differing from the Iranian Islamic 
Republic in race, language and political and social structures. It would also 
set a precedent for other possible independent Islamic republics, unifying 
Sunni Muslim Turkomen or Uzbeks or Kurds straddling Iran's borders. 
</P>
<P>
The real danger to Iran is that if ever the Azeris achieved that state, then 
the dominoes would begin to tumble all round the rim of the Persian 
metropolitan homeland, and Iran could lose up to half of its current territory 
and population. Because Iran and the Soviet Union face the same secessionist 
danger, they have come to see the Azeri-Persian issue eye-to-eye. 
</P>
<P>
Closer contacts with Soviet Azeris would lead Iranian Azeris to making 
comparisons, dangerous to Tehran, between the economic, cultural and social 
development of the two groups. The northern area of Soviet Azerbaijan is 
industrialized and urbanized because of the oil industry around Baku. Even the 
less-developed area of Nakhichevan on the border is far ahead of Iranian 
Azerbaijan, a typically neglected backward part of a Third World country. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Azerbaijan is also culturally advanced, with several centers of higher 
learning and a well-developed publishing industry. After 70 years of secular 
communist rule, the attitudes and style of the Soviet Azeris are much different 
from their Iranian cousins, particularly because of the Islamic republic. The 
northerners would find it very difficult to accept the rule of the mullahs, as 
would Soviet Azeri women the wearing of the black chador. 
</P>
<P>
The problems of trans-frontier and cross-cultural integration were brutally 
revealed when many members of the Turkish minority fled pell-mell from Bulgaria 
into Turkey. When their number reached 300,000, Turkey had to close its 
frontier and introduce visas. The immigrants were soon disillusioned because of 
Turkey's relative backwardness and a lack of suitable employment -- 100,000 
have already returned to Bulgaria and more are on their way. Azeri or Turkoman 
unification would produce the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Iran's Islamic pull might be unable to compete with the counter-pull 
of a better way of life in the ethnically linked areas across the Soviet 
frontier, especially if those areas became autonomous or even independent. If 
chunks of the Soviet empire drop away, that, by itself, could cause fissuring 
and falling away of parts of Iran's empire as well.

   The Stanford University faculty has
voted to replace a Western culture requirement, branded racist by
black students, with one that includes the study of women and
minorities.
   ``We're fighting against the white male estabishment that's been
here for years,'' said David Brown, a member of Students United for
Democratic Education.
   ``The change is a substantial improvement,'' university
President Donald Kennedy said when the Faculty Senate voted 39-4
for the change Thursday.
   ``We feel philosophically that the vote in favor of this was a
vote in favor of moving forward and progression,'' Black Student
Union Chairman Bill King said. ``They voted for moving toward
ethnic studies, not teaching freshmen lies.''
   U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett charged earlier this
year that Stanford was bowing to ``curriculum by intimidation,''
and that higher education in general was losing credibility because
courses on the classics are being displaced. He is scheduled to
speak at Stanford on April 18.
   Beginning next fall, freshmen will take classes on ``Cultures,
Ideas and Values,'' replacing the Western culture program, dubbed
racist two years ago by the Black Student Union.
   Students will still be required to study the likes of Homer,
Plato and Shakespeare but they also will be exposed to works from
at least one non-European culture each quarter.
   According to a draft of the new course, its objective is to
``provide students with the common intellectual experience of
broadening their understanding of ideas and values drawn from
different strands of our own culture, and to increase their
understanding of cultural diversity and the process of cultural
interaction.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Preserving Traditional Culture in Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The sensuous, 1,000-year-old body
language of Cambodia's classical ballet will soon reach Western
audiences, as the country embarks on some ``dance diplomacy.''
   Beginning next month, members of the national dance company will
spend seven weeks performing in Britain and the Netherlands. The
group also has been invited to an arts festival in Los Angeles in
September. However, it is uncertain whether entry will be granted
since the United States has no ties with Phnom Penh.
   The cultural journey is part of an effort to help Cambodia out
of international isolation, and to show the world that its culture
has not been ``Vietnamized.''
   ``The truth is as you see it,'' said dance director Proeung
Chhieng. ``One cannot change one's soul. The Vietnamese have their
culture and we have ours.'' As he spoke young dancers went through
a rigorous practice session at the University of Fine Arts, weaving
hands, swaying hips and gliding across the floor to tell stories of
bygone loves and wars.
   Graduates of such training are to make their first trip to the
West since the early 1970s when the U.S.-sanctioned Lon Nol
government held power. The Khmer Rouge reign of terror all but
eradicated the classical dance.
   The foreign tours are seen by knowledgeable observers as small
steps toward international recognition by a government that most of
the world shuns in favor of a guerrilla coalition led by Prince
Norodom Sihanouk.
   Domestically, the general revival of traditional arts has
probably helped the communist, Vietnam-installed regime to gain
some popularity and buttress its claim of fostering Cambodian
nationalism.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge in
early 1979, unquestionably has had a significant effect on the
country's political course. But Cambodians stridently maintain its
powerful neighbor has not debased, or even influenced, their
culture.
   At the university, for example, the only discernible Vietnamese
influence are a few teachers of Western instruments such as the
accordion and violin. There are reportedly as yet no qualified
Cambodians for these instruments.
   The Sihanouk-led coalition, which includes the Khmer Rouge, and
others have claimed Cambodia is the target of Vietnamese ``cultural
imperialism.''
   While independent observers, including Western aid agency
officials based in Phnom Penh, discount such charges, they note the
state and communist party make use of culture and put limits on
artistic expression.
   Minister of Culture Chheng Phon stressed it was the duty of
artists and intellectuals to support ``good leaders'' and help
fight against the Khmer Rouge.
   Despite censorship of the media the former actor and music
scholar claimed more artistic freedom existed under the current
government than those of Lon Nol or Sihanouk, who ruled Cambodia
first as king and then head of state.
   He said satires mocking official corruption and lust for power
currently being performed would certainly have been banned in
Sihanouk's time.
   In an interview, the minister said the past decade had seen the
rebirth of traditional culture from the Khmer Rouge era. The next
phase, he said, would emphasize ``unleashing the gray matter,
creating something, not just preserving.'' How far this can go in a
country at war and under one-party control remains to be seen.
   William Labban, an Australian ethnomusicologist helping the
ministry, said there was nothing in Phnom Penh that could be
described as an intellectual community. There are no literary
magazines and little printing of any material.
   ``It's a vacuum and it can't be filled while there is a war
going on. You need money and leisure before it can happen,'' he
said.
   But Labban and others say the revival of traditional culture has
been impressive given the meager resources and the physical
depredations and slaughter of artists, teachers and other
intellectuals by the ultra-radical Khmer Rouge.
   Today, the country has three archaeologists, two architects,
three veteran teachers of the classical dance and not a single
skilled librarian. The National Library is still reeling from the
wholesale destruction of books by the Khmer Rouge and the National
Museum, home of priceless statuary, is beset by swarms of bats and
electrical fixtures from the early 1920s.
   Despite Cambodia's political isolation, some foreign assistance
has trickled in from the Belgian government, U.N. Children's Fund,
private Australian agencies and Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
   Judy Ledgerwood, a Cambodia scholar from Cornell, is literally
stopping Cambodian culture from being eaten up by purging palm leaf
manuscripts of destructive insects. The literary and religious
texts, inscribed on palm leaves, are also being microfilmed and
stored in special containers.
   Angkor Wat, one of the world's architectural masterpieces, is
being restored by Indian experts but most other structures from
Cambodia's Golden Age between the 9th and 13th centuries are in
urgent need of care.
   Music, the dance and other arts were traditionally passed down
from teacher to student rather than recorded for posterity. But the
violence and chaos of recent decades has severed these fragile
links.
   To assist in some sort of preservation, Labban is training
students to record old music, and the fine arts university is
videotaping classical dances that have been reconstructed from the
fading memories of the few surviving authorities.

<TEXT>
   Sheep now feed off grass and overgrown
weeds covering millions of bunkers that were built years ago to
seal off Albania. Today, the fight against the world's ``corrupting
effects'' takes a different form.
   Western culture, although carefully monitored by bureaucrats and
intellectuals, seeps through the increasingly porous borders of
Europe's most isolated nation.
   Western ideas contrast sharply with Albanian orthodoxy but there
is little open evidence of any grass-roots disaffection threatening
to topple the last European refuge of Stalinism.
   Reports of anti-communist riots in the northern city of Skhoder
in January apparently were unfounded. Officials here charge they
were fabricated by the state-controlled media in Yugoslavia, which
is at odds with Albania over the fate of millions of ethnic
Albanians in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
   ``We do not want to assimilate; we want to preserve our national
identity,'' said Ymer Minxhozi, general secretary of the Albanian
Union of Journalists.
   ``We have no homosexuality, no prostitution, no drugs and no
black market,'' he told a group of visiting Western journalists.
   The bunkers, first built during World War II to guard against a
land invasion, were vastly expanded after the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact marched into Czechoslovakia in 1968. Now they are falling into
disuse.
   No one knows exactly how many bunkers there are, but one
official estimated at least one for every Albanian _ 3 million.
   ``The bunkers in Albania do not move ... they have no feet or
wheels. They do not threaten anyone,'' Deputy Foreign Minister
Socrat Placa said in an interview.
   During its 45-year history as a Stalinist state, Albania has had
little to do with the world beyond its borders. It still reveres
the memory of Josef Stalin and adheres strictly to Marxist-Leninist
doctrine.
   Albania cut ties with the Soviet Union in 1961 because of its
de-Stalinization program and with China in 1978 because of China's
perceived deviation from Marxist-Leninist policies after Mao
Tse-tung's death.
   Enver Hoxha, the founder of the communist state in Albania, died
in 1985, but his policies and personality cult survive. A Hoxha
museum opened last year, a marble and glass temple among Tirana's
dilapidated and windowless buildings.
   Hoxha's successor, Ramiz Alia, is credited with introducing some
openness and acknowledgement of deficiencies of the Albanian
system. Mistrust and hostility toward Moscow and Washington remain,
however.
   Placa made no effort to disguise his satisfaction when he heard
a Western news report on a visiting reporter's radio of an
explosion at a Soviet military base in Czechoslovakia.
   ``Good, good, very good. ... Of course it may have some
consequences but is a good lesson for Gorbachev,'' Placa said.
   Nevertheless, Placa said, discussions were under way to further
increase ties with ``both East and West.''
   Albanians are able to view Italian, Yugoslavian and Greek
television. Scrawled on a shutter of a backstreet shop in Tirana
were the words, ``IRON MAIDEN,'' a leading British heavy-rock band.
   In another part of town, someone had repeatedly written ``liri''
(freedom) on a kiosk wall, an uncommon slogan in a country with a
powerful secret police, the Sigurimi.
   Activities of the Sigurimi were assailed last year, however, in
a best-selling novel by writer Neshat Tozaj, who works as a
criminal investigator in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
   The novel, ``Thikat'' (Knives), portrayed the Sigurimi as
falsifying evidence and making illegal arrests and detentions.
   Publication of a book exposing abuses of the secret police could
indicate a relaxation of censorship or, as some Western observers
suggested, a power struggle to restrict the Sigurimi.
   ``The artistic qualities of the book were criticized but it
touched on certain themes in our society. ... Life must be
reflected in literature,'' said Nasi Lera, secretary of the
Albanian Union of Artists and Writers.
   Authorities still want to stop controversial material about
Albania from reaching abroad.
   Visiting Finnish television journalists found on their return
home evidence of tampering with an interview with Foreign Minister
Reiz Malile, which had been filmed by a local crew.
   Malile had acknowledged on camera that Albania had some
political prisoners but added, ``It's not a problem.'' That section
of tape was replaced by a segment of an Albanian song contest.
   Modern Western literature is translated into Albanian, and
William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Saul Bellow and Truman Capote
are better known than Spanish, Italian or French writers, said
Ismail Kadare, Albania's best-known modern author.
   ``We don't approve of pornography ... and our greatest problem
is mediocrity. But that's a worldwide problem,'' Kadare added in an
interview.
   ``The West definitely has a corrupting influence ... even though
we must respect them for their marvelous scientific achievements
and progress,'' a 21-year-old woman said.
   She added she would like to go abroad in a student exchange
program, then said, ``But things are so good here.''

FAILURE TO INCLUDE DISTINGUISHED BLACK AUTHORS IN 'THE GREAT BOOKS' AMOUNTS TO 
INTELLECTUAL COLONIALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK MATHABANE, Mark Mathabane is the author of Kaffir Boy in America 
(MacMillan). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, the "Great Books of the Western World" have been a prominent feature 
of my library. Few sets of books have exercised a more profound influence on my 
intellectual growth. 
</P>
<P>
It was therefore with extreme disappointment that I learned that during the 
Encyclopedia Britannica's revision and updating of the "Great Books," in which 
45 authors of the 20th Century, among them James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, F. 
Scott Fitzgerald and Willa Cather, were added to the reading list (women 
writers for the first time), the editors could not find a black writer worthy 
of inclusion. Not one. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointment turned to outrage when I read that W. E. B. DuBois -- historian, 
novelist, editor, essayist, political activist, sociologist and one of this 
century's intellectual giants -- was rejected because nothing in his 
astonishing range of work met the three criteria: relevance to the contemporary 
world, capacity to be reread and universality. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if the editors have impartially read any of DuBois' seminal works. 
"Dusk of Dawn," a tour-de-force autobiography of his struggle for 
"self-conscious manhood," which also brilliantly analyzes the complex issues of 
black liberation and racial conflict, is as important and illuminating as 
Bertrand Russell's memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
As America's first black sociologist, DuBois, in "The Philadelphia Negro," an 
exhaustive empirical examination of ghetto life, made significant contributions 
to the field that seeks to determine the effects of social environment on human 
behavior. This at a time when white sociologists were merely theorizing about 
the plight of blacks in America and race relations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soul of Black Folks" is a literary classic and one of the major 
sociological documents of our time. Though ostensibly about the black 
experience in America, it is not a "black" book, just as Tolstoy's "War and 
Peace" is not a Russian book and "Pride and Prejudice" is not a British book. 
Like these two classics, its insights, provocative ideas and observations 
transcend the narrow boundaries of race and nationality to address momentous 
issues of the human condition and character. 
</P>
<P>
DuBois' themes -- racism, oppression, freedom, justice, history, culture and 
identity -- are bona fide great ideas. In treating them, his DuBois is seldom 
preachy or pedantic, despite his erudition and self-assuredness. His language, 
though impassioned and redolent with pride in and love for black people, is 
reasonable and measured. He analyzes complex problems with the psychological 
precision and clarity of a Freud or William James. 
</P>
<P>
The leitmotif of DuBois' works -- how one achieves self-actualization in a 
world where one lives constantly behind a suffocating veil, and is often 
invisible, sometimes even to oneself -- is not unique to blacks in America. The 
dichotomy of personality created by living behind the veil is common among most 
blacks where the white man has oppressed them, destroyed their heritage and 
imposed upon them a new and alien way of life and being. It exists in South 
Africa, Britain, France, Germany and wherever in the Western World that the 
black man is found. 
</P>
<P>
Why then, in the name of fairness, cannot this vital component of Western 
society and thought be included in the discussion of the great ideas that have 
shaped humankind? 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that the editors of the "Great Books" are culturally 
biased in favor of Western white male authors. The omission of meritorious 
black writers is even more glaring when one considers that the latest inductees 
into the white male intellectual hall of fame -- Faulkner, Hemingway, Orwell, 
Eliot, et al. -- penned their masterpieces in a century (the 20th) replete with 
superb black writers, such as Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, James Weldon 
Johnson, Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, Wole Soyinka and Chinua Achebe, to 
name a few. 
</P>
<P>
It would be shrill and unfair to accuse the editors of the "Great Books" of 
racism. Rather, I choose to believe that they suffer from the widespread but 
erroneous belief that black writers, however brilliant, are invariably "race" 
writers, capable only of writing protest literature, whose literary and 
intellectual value is transient. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the black writers I have mentioned are not period writers. They 
possess in the fullest measure what Dostoyevsky calls "universal sensibility," 
the talent to recreate the essence of other cultures and epochs without losing 
one's individuality and identity. Surely the incisive commentaries of Ellison, 
Wright, Achebe and Baldwin on the problem of race and the human condition are 
not inferior to those of a Mark Twain or William Faulkner, fine white writers 
from whose characters many whites have inferred impressions, often harmful and 
stereotypical ones, about blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us who cherish the "Great Books" sincerely hope that the editors will 
rectify their egregious mistake. Failure to include qualified black authors 
amounts to intellectual colonialism. It robs not only America and the world, 
but also posterity, of the means to understand blacks as human beings and to 
empathize with their manifold experiences and rich culture as an integral part 
of the Western world.

   To Free the Universities...

<LP>
   As the classes of 1991 walk down the aisle to accept their
diplomas, and attention turns to next year's crop of
students, it is an appropriate time for the discussion of the
future of higher education to move to a more mature stage.
Rather than exchange heated allegations of "racial
insensitivity" and "political correctness," we need to begin
a debate on concrete proposals to remedy the crisis facing
our colleges and universities. Toward this end I offer three
proposals.
   As the testimony of many voices across the political
spectrum indicates, liberal education is in danger of
abandoning or even inverting three of its most cherished
principles. At most universities, equal opportunity in
admissions policy has given way to preferential treatment
based on race. The goals of racial integration and the close
interaction of diverse perspectives have been replaced by a
new segregation on campus. Finally, standards, academic
freedom and free speech are under attack at many colleges. My
proposals are intended to reverse these illiberal trends.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In admissions policy: Universities should retain their
policies of preferential treatment, but should alter their
criteria from race to socioeconomic disadvantage. This means
that admissions officers would take into account such factors
as the applicant's family background, financial condition and
primary and secondary school environment, giving preference
to disadvantaged students so long as it is clear that they
can be reasonably expected to meet the academic challenges of
the university. Race or ethnicity, however, would cease to
count either for or against any applicant.
   Ordinarily the admissions policy of selective colleges
should be based on academic and extracurricular merit.
Preferential treatment is justified, however, when it is
obvious that measurable indices of merit do not accurately
reflect a student's learning and growth potential. Every
admissions officer knows that an SAT score of 1,200 out of
1,600 by a student from Harlem or Anacostia, who comes from a
broken family and has struggled against negative peer
pressure and a terrible school system, means something
entirely different from the same score from a student from
Scarsdale or Georgetown, whose privileges include private
tutors and SAT prep courses.
   Universities are entirely justified in giving a break to
students who may not have registered the highest scores, but
whose record suggests that this failure is not due to lack of
ability or application, but rather to demonstrated
disadvantage. Admissions officers are right to see the
academic potential in these students.
   Socioeconomically based affirmative action offers many
advantages over the current race-based approach. No longer
will the children of relatively affluent black and Hispanic
families receive preference over the children of lower middle
class and poor white and Asian families. Yet all minority
groups would disproportionately benefit from such a program,
because they are disproportionately represented in the ranks
of the disadvantaged.
   While it is true that extending affirmative action
benefits to all groups would somewhat reduce the number of
blacks and Hispanics at the most selective schools, this
change could have the positive effect of placing many of
these minority students into colleges where they would
effectively compete with their peers, and graduate at
comparable rates. Race-based preferences often have the
effect of misplacing black and Hispanic students into
academic environments where they are dramatically outmatched
by their classmates, and this contributes to extremely high
dropout rates among these groups.
   Finally socioeconomically based affirmative action would
not create the special stigma that is attached to racial
preference. No longer would universities be forced to explain
the anomaly of enforcing racial discrimination as a means to
combat racial discrimination. The euphemism and mendacity
currently employed to justify ethnic preferences can stop --
the new program can be explicitly stated and defended.
Students are to be judged as individuals, based on their
ability, in the context of their circumstances.
   In life on campus: Universities should discourage the
practice of minority self-segregation by refusing to
recognize or fund any group that is racially separatist, or
that excludes students based on skin color. Universities
should, however, sanction groups based on shared intellectual
or cultural interest, even if these groups appeal
predominantly or exclusively to minority students.
   What this means in practice is that universities would not
permit a Black Students Association, but they would permit a
W.E.B. Du Bois Society based on interest in the writings of
the early 20th century author. Colleges would refuse to
support a Latino Political Club but they would permit a
Sandino Club based on interest in the thought of the
Nicaraguan revolutionary hero. This principle could extend
beyond race, so that universities would decline to fund a
homosexual association but would fund a Sappho Society.
   In all cases, university-funded groups should be built
around intellectual and cultural interests, not skin color or
sexual proclivity. Thought and expression are the currency in
which universities trade and specialize. The consolidation of
identity based on race or sexuality may be a project that
some students ardently seek, but it is not always consistent
with the mission of universities.
   If this solution is adopted, no longer will universities
have to justify the double standards that profess allegiances
to cultural exchange, and then foster minority subcultures on
campus; that encourage minority-pride groups and ethnic
fraternities while prohibiting white-pride groups and
segregated white fraternities.
   There is no reason to think that a Malcolm X Society, for
instance, would not attract any white or Hispanic or Asian
students, but even if only blacks do happen to join, at least
others would have been extended the opportunity. In some
cases, perhaps, groups will be formed on the mere pretext of
a shared idea, but inevitably this pretense will be
challenged by some persistent outsider who insists on signing
up and who cannot be refused membership.
   In the curriculum: Universities should retain their core
requirements emphasizing the classics of Western culture, but
they should broaden the reading list to expose students to
the greatest works of other civilizations as well. What
Matthew Arnold termed the "best that has been thought and
said" would remain the criterion for selection of books, only
now the geographical range would not be limited to Europe but
would cover the entire globe. In practice this means that
Homer, the Bible, Shakespeare and Faulkner would be read in
conjunction with the Bhagavad Gita, the Koran and "The Tale
of Genji."
   Young people must be familiarized with the fundamental
texts of their own civilizations. Just as it would be
embarrassing to encounter an educated Chinese who had never
heard of Confucius, however well versed he might be in Mark
Twain, so also it would be a failure of liberal education to
teach Americans about Asia without immersing them in their
own philosophical and literary tradition. American students
of all races should know something about the Constitution and
the Declaration of Independence, and about the civil war and
the civil rights movement.
   In fact such self-knowledge can prepare Americans to
better understand other cultures. And it is useful, as the
world becomes a smaller place and as this country becomes
more diverse, for students to move beyond their own cultural
shores. For instance young people should not graduate in the
liberal arts without knowing something about the rise of
Islamic fundamentalism, and for this purpose it is helpful to
read the Koran. We hear about Max Weber's doctrine about the
Protestant ethic and the rise of capitalism; is there a
"Confucian ethic" that explains the enormous success of Asian
entrepreneurs?
   These sorts of questions constitute authentic
multicultural education, which may be contrasted with the
bogus multiculturalism currently practiced on many campuses,
where texts are selected largely based on the race, gender or
sexual habits of the author, and where non-Western study
amounts to little more than ethnic cheerleading or Third
World romanticism, combined with intemperate invective
leveled against racism, sexism and homophobia in the West. If
students learn to eschew such vulgar reductionism, then the
greatest works of the human mind can help to liberate them
from their provinciality and prejudice, so that they can
develop stronger rational and moral bases for adopting the
norms of others, or for reaffirming their own.

The gravest issue posed by the Salman Rushdie affair is that of cultural 
collision inside the Western countries. The subject tends to be shunned for 
fear that its identification may promote an invidious discrimination -- as 
indeed it may. Yet it is a fundamental issue in the countries with big 
immigrant minorities radically different from the host populations in religious 
or political-cultural convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie's problems began, after all, in Britain, not Iran. India quietly banned 
his book after it was published last fall. It was when Muslims in the city of 
Bradford, in the north of England, where one in seven of the population is of 
Indian or Pakistani origin, organized a public burning of "The Satanic Verses" 
in January that the affair gained international notoriety. Without that event, 
one may think that the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini might never have heard of 
Salman Rushdie or of his book, written in the English language and the Western 
intellectual and aesthetic idiom, meant for a secular and Western readership. 
</P>
<P>
He did hear of it, and as a result at least 18 people are now dead and there is 
uproar in a score of countries. Rushdie was burned in effigy on Fifth Avenue in 
New York last week. Home Secretary Douglas Hurd has felt obliged to warn 
Britain's Islamic community that violence or the threat of violence in protest 
against Rushdie's writings is intolerable. In France, Prime Minister Michel 
Rocard has formally warned that "appeals for murder, under whatever form, will 
be prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
Many have observed that these events have drastically undermined the efforts 
that have been made for the peaceful integration of Islamic immigrants in 
Western Europe -- efforts conducted, as a writer in Le Monde has said, against 
the opposition of those who oppose immigration on grounds "of a pretended 
non-assimilation of Islam into a secular society." It is not, though, a 
"pretended" problem; it is a real one. 
</P>
<P>
Every political community rests on a general acceptance of certain beliefs 
about social and political values. In immigrant countries, that consensus can 
be achieved in several ways, all painful for the immigrant group. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, the leading immigrant nation, has, historically, broken down 
and assimilated its immigrants to "Americanism" by means of a public education 
system that never questions the primacy of American political values, and 
through the exercise of a powerful social conformism. Popular culture in 
America has also proven to be an overwhelming assimilative force, as it has 
elsewhere in the West. It is America's peculiar good fortune that its 
immigrants have nearly always wanted to assimilate. The first generation might 
cling to "foreign" ways, but the second generation has nearly always 
Americanized itself with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, France is the country that has taken in the most immigrants during 
the 19th and 20th centuries. Assimilation has been enforced by a state 
education system that teaches French civilization and political values without 
compromise, starting out by sitting each immigrant child down to learn about 
"his" ancestors, the ancient Gauls. 
</P>
<P>
Not all national societies have this confidence in themselves, or this 
arrogance. Britain has taken a different course. Since the breakup of the 
British Empire after World War II, it has admitted large numbers of 
Afro-Caribbeans and Indo-Pakistanis from its former colonies. It has adopted 
the goal of a "multicultural" society as government policy. There has not been 
any express attempt to assimilate immigrants to the ideas and attitudes of the 
British majority. 
</P>
<P>
The same policy is increasingly called for, or followed, in Australia, Canada, 
the United States and the other countries that continue to accept large numbers 
of immigrants. In the United States, it is posed in the demand for multilingual 
education. 
</P>
<P>
This policy is defended as a matter of justice as well as of respect for the 
beliefs and cultural legacies of others. Why should people be expected to 
abandon their children to ideas and values alien to themselves? What cultural 
superiority does the accepting country possess that it should dictate on such 
matters to the immigrant? Is this not "cultural chauvinism?" Indeed, is it not 
racism, or something uncomfortably close to that? 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that without a community of values and cultural assumption there is 
no community at all. Do you believe that Rushdie, or anyone else, has the right 
to say and publish whatever is on his mind? Do you think that the freedom to do 
so is essential to the political community in which you wish to live? Or do you 
believe that God's truth, as you understand it, should be enforced against 
false ideas -- or even that offenders against that truth deserve to die? 
</P>
<P>
You can believe the one or the other. You can't believe both. A coherent 
political community cannot exist without a consensus of agreement on one or the 
other. That is the problem that Salman Rushdie and his book are forcing people 
to confront.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Khmers Are Dancing Again

   Phnom Penh -- "We have two stomachs, the upper for the
soul, the lower for the body. When the upper is hungry, the
lower is also hungry," says Chheng Phon, Cambodia's Minister
of Culture. "Culture is the soul of the nation. So every
Khmer has to think about culture -- except Pol Pot; he wasn't
interested in culture. To restore culture is to restore the
people's soul that was damaged under Pol Pot."
   That may sound like rhetoric, but the spirit and practice
of the idea pervades Phnom Penh. The capital now has two
lively fine arts schools, one teaching music and dance, the
other specializing in the plastic arts, architecture and
archaeology. The combined enrollment is 1,200 students, and
they are dedicated. The concentration on the faces of girls
no more than eight or nine years old being taught classical
Khmer dance banishes any doubts about the practical results
of the Ministry of Culture's high-mindedness.
</LP>

   Phnom Penh again has a professional theater company,
versed in all forms of traditional performing arts and with
some 300 artists and technicians. There are 15 other theater
groups in the capital, as well as regional folkloric troupes
in four provinces.
   These achievements all have come since the overthrow of
Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge 10 years ago. During its 3
1/2-year reign of terror, the Khmer Rouge did its best to
wipe clean the slate of Khmer history, destroying traditional
culture and killing those who represented it.
   After the Vietnamese invasion in 1979 and subsequent
installation of the Heng Samrin government, officials wanted
to reopen Phnom Penh's Fine Arts School. The number of
professionals in all spheres of music, dance and theater who
had survived Pol Pot totaled just 47, according to one
source. Mr. Chheng estimates that 80% to 90% of Cambodia's
intellectuals -- scientists, engineers, doctors, as well as
artists -- were lost during Pol Pot's reign.
   That tragedy, and the subsequent struggle faced by the
Ministry of Culture, were compounded by the fact that
cultural forms had never been recorded. Historically,
teaching had been conducted through a close master-pupil
relationship, and learning was by a kind of osmosis.
   Vietnamese troops remained in the country until the
official withdrawal last September. Some commentators have
accordingly tried to suggest that Cambodian culture has been
"Vietnamized." This isn't true.
   "Vietnamization? There's none at all," says William
Lobban, an Australian ethnomusicologist working as a
nongovernment agency volunteer with the Ministry of Culture.
"The Vietnamese did suggest the introduction of Western
ballet, but the Khmer resisted, saying they have their own
style of dance. No, the only Vietnamese influence has been in
Western music."
   Walking unannounced through the campus of the Fine Arts
School, I heard the strains of a violin coming from one music
practice room, though the distinctive notes of a classical
Khmer instrument wafted loud and clear from another.
   There were no signs of a diluted culture. Khmer forms were
to be seen not only in the classrooms, but also outside.
Donated by Unicef, the new dining hall at the dramatic arts
school has been built in traditional style.
   The gains of the last 10 years have been made through
sheer hard work and with limited funding. Yet the will is
strong. "One of the reasons why so much effort is being put
into this field is that the people know if they do not have
their culture, they are no longer Khmer. Classical arts are
probably more pure now than before because the people
realized the danger of losing everything," says Mr. Lobban.
"What is so interesting here is the people's sense of
history. When you talk of classical dance, you are referring
directly to Angkor and pre-Angkor times, and yet there is
continual reference to the classical in modern culture. Even
the children have a sense of history and will play at battles
between Khmer and Chams {the two ancient civilizations of the
region}."
   For the moment there are only occasional public
performances of classical Khmer dance, but the interest is
there. At a small show put on by students for visiting Unicef
officials, Khmer drivers and guides in the audience appeared
more enthralled than the guests. They laughed out loud at a
comic scene from the "Riemkay" masked dance drama.
   In his work at the Ministry of Culture, Mr. Lobban is
collaborating on a photo book cataloging the 5,000 gestures
of classical Khmer dance. He also is writing a volume
describing the 12 different forms of Khmer theater, including
various types of dance, music and shadow puppets.
   With a peaceful settlement to the Cambodian conflict still
to be found, continued success in the revival of classical
Khmer culture remains uncertain. "The next five years will be
critical," says Mr. Lobban. "Teachers are getting old, and
there is a generation gap between them and the students. If
we don't get organized now, it'll be too late. There is a
need to get knowledge out of old heads and into new heads or
on video."
   But he is optimistic. "There is a tremendous feeling that
it is going to happen. There was never a doubt in people's
minds that after 1979 they could rebuild their culture."
   Mr. Chheng expresses similar confidence in his quiet,
assured conversation. "Even though the country is at war, we
are opening secondary schools of fine arts in the provinces."

<F P=106> [Address by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic </F>
revolution, on the occasion of Islamic Revolution Guard Corps 
Day amd the birth anniversary of Husayn, the third Shiite imam, 
to members of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps and the law 
enforcement forces at the Imam Khomeyni mosque in Tehran on 16 
January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [crowd chants: "We are all your soldiers, 
Khamene'i. We are ready to receive your orders, Khamene'i," and 
other slogans] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. On this great and auspicious day I sincerely 
congratulate all freedom-loving and justice-seeking people of 
the world, and particularly the great Iranian nation, the brave 
youth of this land, and the offspring of the Koran; that is, the 
dear guards of the revolution and you, dear participants. 
[passage omitted] 
  Today Islam is flourishing in the world. Today Islam is 
attracting nations to itself as the most brilliant and clear 
source of hope. Is this a joke, after the passage of 1,400 
years? It is due to the blessings of the uprising of Husayn 
Bin-'Ali. It is Almighty God's wish that, for the first time 
since the era of Husayn Bin-'Ali, the Koran should rule in the 
Islamic Republic. Everything that has been done since Imam 
Husayn's uprising has been an introduction to today for you. 
All those scholars, thinkers, philosophers, and speakers; all 
those efforts and all the Crusader wars -- throughout it all, 
Islam was protected and conditions were prepared for today, so 
that a government be created that is based on divine and Koranic 
values. You, the Iranian nation, were fortunate to have the 
opportunity to be trusted, for the first time, with that 
responsibility. [passage omitted] This is not something that 
will end. Do not think that the Islamic Republic is going to be 
destroyed by the utterances of a few simple-minded wishful 
thinkers who say it is going to end today or tomorrow. No, sir. 
These foundations are not going be annihilated. [Crowd chants: 
"God is great;" "Khamene'i is the leader;" "Death to America;" 
"Death to Israel," and other slogans] 
  You and I will of course come to an end. Individuals do not 
go on for ever. The best are those who guard themselves until 
death. And some even fail to do that. There are all types. 
Individuals are vulnerable to damage and destruction. However, 
the basics continue. This Islamic revolution, this Islamic 
revival has its roots in history, in 10 centuries of effort and 
struggle. It relies on Islam, and for this very reason today -- 
at a time when, more than ever, Zionist and arrogant propaganda 
has tried to portray an ugly image of the Islamic Republic, 
Iran, Iranian people, us, and everyone -- popular attraction 
toward Islam, in all parts of the Islamic world, is growing at a 
greater rate than five or 10 years ago. Look at Islamic 
countries. Look at Muslim minorities in non-Islamic countries. 
Look at the harsh measures taken by the arrogant powers against 
Muslims. There is a reason for such severity. If the Muslims 
were like a body at the hands of the mortician, there would be 
no severity. 
  I wish to state that the element of loneliness in the 
contemporary movement has created a degree of similarity between 
us and the movement of Husayn Bin-'Ali. Do not fear the 
loneliness. Do not be scared, for Husayn Bin-'Ali and his 
companions -- for whom we mourn and weep, and whom we love more 
than our own children -- reached the heights of loneliness. The 
result was that Islam is alive today. The events of Karbala' 
[where Husayn died in battle] were not limited to a small region 
but concern a large part of contemporary humanity. Karbala' is 
now everywhere. Look at literature, culture, traditions, and 
beliefs, and at people's hearts. Even the man who does not bow 
down to God respects the greatness of Husayn Bin-'Ali. That was 
the result of loneliness. He was the height of loneliness. And 
today you are lonely and today the Iranian nation is lonely and 
wronged. But its loneliness and meekness does not mean 
weakness. We are very powerful today. No other Muslim nation 
-- and dare to believe this -- is as powerful as the Muslim 
nation of Iran. No other nation, be it small, large, or with a 
population of 100 million. 
  Iran is alone in the world today. The power of the people 
of Iran today is at its zenith; the same applies to the Iranian 
Government. The government is very powerful, very dear; those 
in positions of power in the world pay attention to the 
Government of Iran. The people and the government are strong 
and capable; they know what they are doing. At the same time, 
they are lonely and oppressed. We are alone in the world today. 
No power in the world supports us today. This does not mean 
that all the powers in the world are lined up against us; no, do 
not let our enemies get happy, thinking: Thank God, all the 
powers are against Iran. Even if this was the case, it would 
not matter. We have experienced such a situation. No, today 
all the governments and powers of the world are not lined up 
against us. There are many governments who feel that, 
considering the material criteria that they have, it is not in 
their interest to line themselves up against the Iranian people. 
  But no one helps or supports our people. The most powerful, 
arrogant powers of the world confront our people, are enemies of 
our people. They oppress the Iranian people, they do not take 
their rights into account, they make accusations against our 
people. They do not consider our people's good points, and they 
make a mountain out of a molehill of our bad points. This is 
the oppression and loneliness of the Iranian people. This 
oppression and loneliness should make you stronger. I say that 
this is a blessing from God. Some corruption exists, but the 
structure of society is healthy. If we were like one of those 
so-called revolutionary countries of the previous era -- today 
they do not exist...[pauses] There used to be certain 
countries and governments that were so-called revolutionary, 
they were supported by one of the bullying powers of that era, 
the Soviet Union, which supported them. If we were like them, 
our people and government would have been corrupted. You see 
today that the people and government have, thank God, remained 
healthy. This does not mean that there is no corruption among 
the people or officials; there is to a certain extent, but the 
structure is healthy, the composition is healthy, the main 
elementsare healthy; members of the society who occupy sensitive 
positions are healthy. This is a great blessing. This blessing 
comes from being alone, from relying on no one but God. 
  There are two trends. One is the trend of Islam, the Koran, 
divine values, and spirituality, with the Islamic Republic at 
its zenith. Officials of this system are standing up under this 
enormous pressure, strongly and without fear or hesitation. 
They are happy and do not bow down. This is one trend. The 
other trend consists of all the satans of the world, all the 
evil ones of the world. All the mischievous ones of the world 
belong to the other trend. 
  There exists a division here. If anyone has any energy, 
where should he expend that energy? If anyone has anything to 
say, if anyone can take the initiative, where should he be? If 
someone inside this faction of righteousness, or outside this 
faction of righteousness, starts to wage a war on this faction 
-- which is fighting mischief and evil to such an extent -- 
based on the premise that this faction of righteousness has not 
paid attention to a particular point, or committed a small 
mistake, error, or even sin, can this be right? Is this not 
weakening divine power in the line of blaspheming against the 
blessings of God? 
  Those who have nothing to say apart from utterances that 
weaken the front of righteousness, weaken the officials, weaken 
the government, the president, the judiciary, the Majles, using 
any excuse ... [pauses] For example, they say: The judiciary 
issued the wrong sentence in such and such a case; such and such 
a judge said this; such and such a government official acted in 
such and such a way. Rather than expending their energy to 
confront the faction of evil, they use these excuses and use the 
same energy to fight against the faction of righteousness. Are 
they not blaspheming against the blessings of God? Don't they 
deserve divine punishment?
