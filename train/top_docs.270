THE Venezuelan cabinet approved at the weekend a Dollars 1.7bn heavy oil
project to be carried out by Conoco, a subsidiary of EI du Pont, and
Venezuela's national oil company, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas.
The project calls for producing and upgrading very heavy crude oil from
Venezuela's Orinoco oil belt, the world's largest known accumulation of
heavy oil and bitumen.
This is the first time a foreign company will be allowed to participate as a
direct investor in Venezuela's oil production sector since the republic
nationalised its petroleum industry in 1976. It is also the first step
towards opening up large-scale production in the belt.
Conoco and Maraven, a subsidiary of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA,
will be equal partners in the project, according to Mr Frank Alcock, PDVSA
vice-president.
The plan, which must be approved by the Venezuelan congress, involves
producing 120,000 barrels a day of extra-heavy crude oil from the Orinoco
belt and converting it into 102,000 barrels a day of lighter gravity oil,
plus 3,000 tonnes of petroleum coke.
The belt, north of the Orinoco river, contains an estimated 1,200bn barrels
of extra-heavy crude oil and bitumen.

Arco International Oil and Gas has signed a letter of intent with Corpoven,
a subsidiary of PDVSA, Venezuela's national oil company, covering the
development of a heavy oil project requiring total investments of Dollars
3.5bn.
The plan is to produce and upgrade heavy crude oil from Venezuela's Orinoco
Belt for export, reaching shipments of 200,000 barrels a day by 2004.
The Orinoco Belt, located north of the Orinoco River, holds the world's
largest known reserves of heavy oils and bitumen. PDVSA, which estimates
reserves in the belt at 1,200bn barrels, has assigned strategic importance
to developing this heavy oil potential.
Arco, a subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield of the US, and Corpoven plan to
upgrade heavy crude oil through a new industrial process to a lighter, more
valuable oil, and later blend the product with other Venezuelan crudes.
Exports are to be aimed mainly at US markets.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Venezuela (5): Treacly rival to coal and oil - The
potential and pitfalls of a new fuel from the Orinoco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the mid-1980s, Venezuela's PDVSA and BP developed a new fuel called
Orimulsion.
Orimulsion, now registered by PDVSA as a trade name, is an emulsion made up
of approximately 70 per cent natural bitumen by volume, and 30 per cent
water, plus a surfactant, or additive to keep the mixture stable.
It is being marketed as a fuel for electric power generation plants and
other industrial facilities that generate power.
The motivation for developing this fuel came from the huge reserves of
bitumen and extra-heavy crude oil that Venezuela possesses in the Orinoco
Belt, the world's largest deposits of their type.
PDVSA has estimated that the Orinoco Belt holds 1.2 trillion barrels of
bitumen and heavy oil in place, and that around 270bn barrels can be
recovered for commercial use.
Orimulsion has been tested commercially in Canada, Japan and the UK, and
PDVSA has signed long-term contracts to supply the product to power plants
in these countries and Spain. PowerGen's Ince B plant is one of the plants
in Britain where Orimulsion is used.
In 1991, PDVSA produced 1.1m tonnes of Orimulsion, four times its output the
previous year. Sales to international clients reached 885,000 tonnes in
1991, up 700,000 tonnes from 1990.
Through its subsidiary Bitor, as well as joint ventures between Bitor, BP
and Mitsubishi, PDVSA is aggressively marketing Orimulsion internationally.
The company's goal is to be producing - and selling - around 41m tonnes per
annum by 1996.
PDVSA is pushing Orimulsion as an economical, long-term alternative to coal
and fuel oil. It can be transported and stored like fuel oil, and, unlike
coal, does not raise dust during transportation.
The company says that relatively small investments are required to adapt
plants that burn fuel oil to Orimulsion. However, some serious questions
have been raised in the US and the UK about pollution problems that might be
associated with this new fuel, including emissions of sulphur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide (the two main acid rain gases), particles and others.
PDVSA asserts that Orimulsion compares favourably with other fossil fuels in
terms of environmental impact.
Citing the results of independent tests and commercial applications, PDVSA
says that Orimulsion produces levels of sulphur dioxide emissions that are
lower than those produced by 2.5 per cent sulphur coal and slightly higher
than 3.5 per cent sulphur fuel oil.
It also asserts that Orimulsion's high caloric value means that lower
volumes will be burned (and thus less sulphur dioxide released) than by
fuels with less caloric value, to generate the same amount of energy.
As for nitrogen oxide emissions, PDVSA states that Orimulsion produces less
than coal and the same or less than fuel oil. The company says that
Orimulsion burned in conventional power stations produces about 20 per cent
less carbon dioxide than equivalent coal-fired stations, and levels similar
to plants burning fuel oil.
Particle emissions, PDVSA states, are 'well within the strictest limits set
by developed industrialised countries", and acid smuts are unlikely in power
stations burning Orimulsion.
In test spills, a high percentage of Orimulsion disperses of its own accord,
the company says.
At the same time, PDVSA's R&amp;D unit, Intevep, has produced a 'second
generation' of Orimulsion that is supposed to be cleaner than the first.

<HL> U.S. Begins to Take Notice as Venezuela
Lifts Its Estimates of Proven Oil Reserves

<TEXT>
   Venezuela is finally getting some attention from Washington in its long-running campaign to sell more oil in the U.S. 

   U.S. energy officials have begun mentioning that Venezuela is one of the biggest suppliers of oil to this country, although none are yet suggesting than Venezuelan oil imports be increased. 
And U.S. geological teams were recently in Venezuela to confirm the South American country's sharp upward revisions in its estimates of proven oil reserves. 

   Venezuelan oil officials still worry, nonetheless, that the U.S. might enact an oil-import tax. 
And they question whether Venezuela's petroleum-producing potential is recognized in this country. 
They are puzzled by the U.S. focus on the Middle East as the key, but possibly unstable, source for future oil needs while Venezuela's big petroleum reserves are much closer and offer secure supplies. 

   In January, the most recent period for which figures are available, Venezuela ranked No. 2 as an oil exporter to the U.S. with an average of about 850,000 barrels daily, behind Saudi Arabia, with almost 900,000. 
In recent years, Venezuela, Mexico and Canada have been the three largest exporters of oil to the U.S. 

   "There's no question we have more oil than Saudi Arabia," Juan Chacin Guzman, president of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., said in an interview. 

   Mr. Chacin, in Houston to participate in the World Petroleum Congress, and other officials of Petroleos de Venezuela, the country's national oil company, may be stretching a point in comparing their oil reserves to Saudi Arabia's. 
At the beginning of this year, annual industry calculations generally put Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves at 167 billion barrels -- still the largest in the world and several times higher than the official 25-billion-barrel estimate for Venezuela's proven reserves. 

   But Venezuela's recent upgrading, which isn't yet reflected in official figures, doubled its own estimates of proven reserves to 55 billion barrels, about twice those of the U.S. 
In addition, Petroleos de Venezuela counts 267 billion barrels of proven reserves of lower-quality extraheavy crude in its Orinoco Oil Belt. 

   Proven reserves are generally defined as those that can be produced with current technology at today's prices. 
According to geological experts from outside Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela has followed generally accepted reserves-accounting practices in the recent revisions. 
The revisions include changing semi-proven reserves, a category that isn't any longer used by the industry, to proven reserves. 

   Both Saudi Arabia and Venezuela are founding members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
Saudi crudes are lighter and thus more desired for refiners' fuel mix. 
Venezuela, however, is much closer to the U.S., only five days away by oil tanker. 
It has been a steady U.S. supplier for decades, even during the Arab oil embargo. 
Most of its oil exports go to the U.S. 

   But Venezuelan conventional petroleum tends toward the less-desired heavier grades. 
The Orinoco crude is so dense that it is generally typed as nonconventional oil. 
Once pumped it must be kept heated or blended with light fuels to be transported, and many refineries aren't equipped to handle it. 

   Mr. Chacin said facilities are in place in the Orinoco Belt for output of 150,000 barrels a day of the heavy oil. 
Only about a third of that is currently being produced. 
In all, Venezuela is producing around 1.5 million barrels a day of crude oil, about in line with its OPEC quota. 
It also produces 160,000 barrels a day of condensate, a very light oil, and 110,000 barrels a day of gas liquids, neither of which is included in the OPEC quota. 

   This leaves Venezuela with 900,000 barrels a day of unused production capacity, Mr. Chacin said. 
"We could go to four million barrels a day (production)," he said, noting that current capacity is 2.6 million barrels a day. 

   Exploration is mainly for lighter crudes. 
Petroleos de Venezuela's operating subsidiaries recently have made some major finds of the higher-quality lighter oil. 
Those finds aren't yet included in the revised estimates. 

   In its push to open new markets for its oil, Venezuela has been more aggressive than most OPEC members in buying interests in petroleum refineries, particularly in the U.S. 
Among recent investments, as previously reported, were 50% interests in refineries at Lake Charles, La., and Corpus Christi, Tex. 
In the U.S. and Europe, such arrangements currently provide outlets for 500,000 barrels a day of Venezuelan oil, Mr. Chacin said. 
Through additional joint ventures in the U.S. or Europe, he said, Petroleos de Venezuela expects to expand such sales to 700,000 barrels a day.

FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Venezuela (4): Squeezed between rising taxes and
depressed prices - Oil industry tackles opposing pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), faces
some serious difficulties which are not of its own making.
PDVSA, with 1991 gross international sales of Dollars 22.3bn, is squeezed
between weak oil prices and steep taxes and investment requirements. While
the company remains well-managed, efficient and profitable, the current
situation has produced serious cash flow problems and has forced PDVSA to
acquire nearly Dollars 5bn in debt, having been debt-free only a few years
ago.
It also has been obliged to stretch out its capital investment programme and
seek international equity partners for projects in petroleum sectors that
previously had been off limits to private investment.
Like other major international oil companies, PDVSA is suffering from the
effects of low oil prices on world markets. This year, the average export
price for PDVSA crude and refined products through mid-November fell below
last year's price of Dollars 15.92 per barrel. The export price was Dollars
20.33 per barrel in 1990 and Dollars 17.85 per barrel in 1989.
And, like other big suppliers of refined petroleum products to the US
market, PDVSA - the world's third largest oil refiner - must spend large
sums on upgrading its refining complexes in order to meet tougher
environmental standards for key export products such as gasoline.
PDVSA expects to invest at least Dollars 3.6bn in refinery improvements over
the next several years to meet or exceed provisions of the US Clean Air Act,
and to ensure compliance with environmental regulations in other places
where it sells refined products, especially Europe.
These investments are also aimed at permitting PDVSA's home refineries to
process increased volumes of heavy crude, which is abundant in Venezuela.
(Apart from four refining complexes in Venezuela, PDVSA wholly or partially
owns large oil refining and petrochemical plants in the US and Europe.)
In addition, PDVSA must constantly invest huge sums in crude oil production.
The country's oil fields suffer a potential decline in output of 22-23 per
cent per annum, which means that PDVSA must invest over Dollars 2bn a year
simply to maintain crude output at the present capacity level.
The company is also building new production potential, which requires even
greater investments. Its target is to raise crude oil production capacity
from the current level of 2.8m b/d to 4m b/d by 2002. 'PDVSA must grow,'
said Mr Alirio Parra, Venezuela's Minister of Energy and Mines.
At the same time, PDVSA is being slowly strangled by a heavy tax burden at
home. The company currently pays at least 82 per cent of its operating
profits to the Venezuelan Treasury in taxes and royalties. (The maximum
corporate tax rate for companies outside the oil sector is 30 per cent.) And
since the Venezuelan government relies on oil to provide most if its
revenues (despite years of talking about diversification), a dramatic
reduction in PDVSA's tax burden cannot be made overnight.
Working together, Energy Minister Parra and the president of PDVSA, Mr
Gustavo Roosen, have been able to develop some solutions to the company's
problems, although relief will not be immediate.
The Energy Ministry, which draws up policy guidelines for PDVSA, has eased
the company's tax burden slightly this year by adjusting the export value
system.
Export values of crude and refined products are used as a base to calculate
PDVSA income taxes. The minister also has introduced legislation that would
phase out the export value system on a staggered basis by 1996, and has
changed some accounting rules applied to PDVSA's books and tax declarations.
These initiatives will provide substantial tax savings for the national oil
company in coming years, but will not pull the fiscal carpet out from under
the the government.
Other changes are also being studied to ease PDVSA's tax burden. Taken as a
whole, these measures should ensure that PDVSA will be able to push ahead
comfortably with future investments and continue to generate net profits.
The government itself has proposed new taxes, including a version of VAT,
that will make it less dependent on the vicissitudes of its main commodity,
petroleum.
PDVSA is moving ahead with direct investments in production and refining,
which are necessary if the company is to maintain its international market
share. But it has stretched out some projects contained in its medium term
investment plan, delayed others and is looking to international capital to
develop a variety of joint-venture projects in heavy oil, refining, natural
gas and other areas that were formerly the exclusive domain of PDVSA and its
subsidiaries.
'The most limited resource that the the petroleum industry has today is
money,' said PDVSA president Roosen. 'I don't want things to be left undone
simply because we don't have the cash.' The company's current investment
plan through 2002 totals Dollars 40bn, at 1992 prices.
Of this total, PDVSA will carry out direct capital spending of Dollars 28bn,
while it hopes that international investors - either acting alone or in
joint ventures with the company - will invest another Dollars 12bn. Apart
from newly targeted areas for foreign investment such as oil production and
refining, PDVSA has established - or is negotiating - joint ventures with
Venezuelan and international partners in natural gas, petrochemicals, coal
and Orimulsion, a new fuel that is an emulsion of bitumen and water. PDVSA
is marketing Orimulsion as an alternative to coal in electric power plants.
To save money, PDVSA also has cut its operating and capital budgets this
year, and will continue controlling costs in 1993. Capital spending for 1992
is expected to reach Dollars 3.7bn, about the same as last year.
PDVSA this year opened the door to limited-scale private investment in oil
production. It asked oil companies from Venezuela and abroad to bid on crude
oil production contracts covering a series of old oil fields that PDVSA
itself did not want to reactivate.
As a result, two groups made up of Benton Oil (US)/Vinccler (Venezuela) and
Teikoku Oil of Japan signed operating contracts under which they pledged to
invest Dollars 280m over the next 10 years to develop new production from
marginal oil fields in eastern Guarico state and southeastern Monagas state.
The two groups will not own the oil and natural gas they produce, but will
turn it over to PDVSA subsidiaries and receive compensation according to the
volumes of oil they can pump.
Last month, Energy Minister Parra announced that the government and PDVSA
were seeking bids for production contracts on 73 other marginal fields with
total proven oil reserves of more than 1.2bn barrels.
Heavy oil is an important resource for PDVSA. Venezuela has the world's
largest known deposits of bitumen and extra-heavy crude in the Orinoco Belt,
an area that lies north of the Orinoco River. Heavy and extra-heavy crude
oils contain high levels of carbon, sulphur and metals that must be removed
at high cost before the crude can be processed in normal oil refineries.
PDVSA has two main approaches to developing its reserves of bitumen and
extra-heavy crudes. The first is an international marketing programme for
Orimulsion, a fuel composed of bitumen and water that is made by PDVSA
subsidiaries. The second involves seeking a foreign partner who can provide
technology and capital for developing new production of extra-heavy crudes
and converting them into lighter, higher quality oils (called syncrudes)
that can be processed in normal refineries.
An upgrading plant using Veba Oel technology to produce 131,000 b/d of
synthetic crude oil, for example, would cost over Dollars 4bn. PDVSA has
signed letters of intent with more than a dozen international oil companies
with the idea of developing strategic business associations in heavy oil.
Due to the long start-up period for heavy oil projects of this type, the
government and PDVSA plan to offer investors access to light/medium crude
oils during the first stage of project development. This would give
investors a positive cash flow until the heavy oil processing plant could go
on stream. PDVSA is currently considering offers on heavy oil projects from
Conoco, Veba Oel, Elf Aquitaine, Mobil and Total.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 29 
March. 
  The possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve may tighten 
its 
monetary policies and increase interest rates in the short term 
once again made the prices of Venezuelan foreign debt bonds 
decrease to the same level reached on 27 November 1992, a coup 
day. Chemical Bank reports indicate that the price of foreign 
debt bonds fell by four points and closed at 53.50 points. There 
is also a possibility that U.S. T-bills, whose profitability 
registered 6.97 percent, will continue to decrease. On 21 March, 
all these scenarios combined made the Caracas Stock Exchange 
index lose 3.6 percent and close at 24,654.82 points, which is a 
level similar to that reached on 16 August 1992. (Caracas EL 
NACIONAL in Spanish 22 Mar 94 p E-1) 
  The Central Bank of Venezuela, BCV, is offering a record 
amount of 50 billion bolivares worth of zero-coupon bonds. About 
40 billion bolivares will mature in 90 days, and the remaining 
10 billion bolivares will mature in 182 days. The 
90-day-zero-coupon bonds registered a 52.13 percent 
return-on-equity, ROE, rate, which in turn will make fluctuating 
interest rates increase. (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in 
Spanish 23 Mar 94 p 9) 
  Ferrominera Orinoco and Edelca, subsidiaries of the 
Venezuelan Guayana Corporation, CVG, will not be included in the 
privatization process that the Executive Branch is promoting. 
CVG President Francisco Layrisse said Caroni Aluminum Inc. is 
the only subsidiary that in six months, at the latest, will sell 
55 percent of its stock to private companies. As for Ferrominera 
Orinoco, the private sector will only have access to invest in 
the iron transformation process. Ferrominera Orinoco President 
Andres Caleca said the law stipulates that only the state has 
the right to tap iron. (Caracas Venezolana de Television Network 
in Spanish 1550 GMT 23 Mar 94) 
  The BCV's Board of Directors has decided to modify the 
mechanisms that control interest rates on loans. For instance, 
it decreased the ceiling rate that banks can charge with 
fluctuating interest rates from 20 to 15 points above the ROE 
rate on zero-coupon bonds. It is worth mentioning that the six 
largest banks currently charge an average fluctuating interest 
rate of 63.8 percent. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 24 Mar 
94 p 1-1) 
  The European Union's Nomenclature Committee recently decided 
to categorize Orimulsion as a bituminous substance. This 
decision opens new opportunities to sell larger amounts of this 
type of fuel to world markets. Frank Alcock, Venezuela 
Petroleum, Petroven, acting president, appeared before the 
Senate's Energy and Mines Commission and said that this new 
category for Orimulsion will prevent a reduction of its 
competitive edge in the Old Continent. The Council on Customs 
Affairs will issue its final ruling on Orimulsion on 4 April. 
Orimulsion exports amounted to 721,000 tons in 1992 and 2.79 
million tons in 1993. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 24 Mar 94 
p E-6) 
  On 23 March, Petroven Acting President Fred Alcock said 
Petroven will reduce expenses in 1994 by an additional 6 billion 
bolivares. He added that this reduction will bring to the 
treasury additional revenues amounting to 26 billion bolivares. 
Alcock appeared before the Senate's Energy and Mines Commission 
to explain Petroven's business plan. He also said that Venezuela 
will continue to sell gasoline to the United States. (Caracas EL 
DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 16) 
  The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest 
rates has landed a heavy blow on the already vulnerable 
Venezuelan economy because the price of its foreign debt bonds 
will drop. This means, however, that the risk to investment 
could fall, which in turn could attract more capital to the 
country. In short, the loss generated by lower prices on foreign 
debt bonds could be compensated by reinvesting said bonds on 
securities with higher interest rates as long as the bonds 
mature in the short term. (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in

  Carlos Pulido Salvatierra, Association of Venezuelan 
Exporters president, said nontraditional Venezuelan exports to 
Colombia amounted to $500 million during the first quarter of 
1994. He added that it is expected that said exports will amount 
to almost $2 billion in 1994, which is 40 percent higher than in 
1993. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2038 GMT 25 Mar 94) 
  The Finance Ministry estimates that the 1995 budget will 
amount to 1.7 trillion bolivares and that gasoline prices will 
increase in 1995. Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said the 
mass transit system may receive additional subsidies in 1995. 
Jorge Serrano, vice president of the Venezuelan Federation of 
Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Fedecamaras, 
underscored that gasoline prices must drastically change because 
gasoline receives 40 billion bolivares worth of subsidies 
annually. The Fedecamaras believes that the price of high-octane 
gasoline must increase. (Caracas Venezolana de Television

  New Petroven Director Luis Giusti has said Petroven reduced 
its investment costs by $4 billion due to drops in hydrocarbon 
prices. He added that Petroven reduced other expenses by $3 
billion. Giusti pointed out that there is an international 
consensus on the opening of the national oil industry to private 
capital and that oil prices will not recover soon. (Mexico City

   National oil companies dominate new rankings of the
world's top oil companies with Petroleos de Venezuela moving
ahead of Exxon Corp. on at least one list.
   In its annual ranking of the 50 largest oil companies,
Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, or PIW, will report in its
issue out today that Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, is
third from the top.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In this position, up from fifth place last year,
Venezuela's aggressive government-owned company has jumped
ahead of both the U.S.-based Exxon and Mexico's state-owned
Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex. But Saudi Arabia's
government-owned company, or Saudi Aramco, and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group maintained their rankings by the oil
industry publication as the largest and the No. 2 companies.
   "Exxon's fall from the No. 1 to No. 4 slot over a few
years is indicative of the difficulties encountered by
privately-owned companies in obtaining secure sources of
crude oil following the nationalizations of oil and gas
reserves" by producer governments more than a decade ago, PIW
reported.
   PIW bases its ranking of the top 50 on the basis of
operational data from nearly 100 firms. Its focus on
operations differs from most financially-oriented corporate
rankings but allows "meaningful comparisons" of all types of
companies, the publication maintains.
   The rankings are based on the most recent operating data
available, PIW said. Given the lag in publishing information,
its latest rankings are for 1990, it added. Government-owned
Kuwait Petroleum Co. dropped completely from the top 10 firms
in the PIW rankings and is now No. 14, reflecting the United
Nations embargo imposed after the Iraqi invasion of the
country in August 1990.
   The criteria used by PIW in its rankings are oil and gas
reserves, oil and gas production, refining capacity and
petroleum product sales. "Financial data are not used because
of the difficulties imposed in comparing state-owned firms
with private sector firms," PIW said.
   The oil industry newsletter said several of the
state-owned firms in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are making significant headway in refining and
marketing endeavors even as they grow "upstream" in crude oil
production. Venezuela's PDVSA is setting the pace, the
publication added.
   According to PIW, the Venezuelan company added 400,000
barrels a day of refining capacity in 1990 while increasing
crude production by 7.5% to more than 2.1 million barrels a
day. In contrast to PDVSA's success, the reserves and
production performance of the major international oil
companies declined, PIW noted.
   As previously reported, PDVSA has an ambitious $48 billion
energy expansion plan that includes an increase in its oil
production capacity to 3.5 million barrels a day by 1995. It
is seeking foreign partners among the international oil
companies for their financial and technological assistance.
Several major oil companies already have signed preliminary
agreements with PDVSA that could lead to joint ventures in
the development of Venezuela's oil, including the heavy
Orinoco crudes.
   Mobil Corp. is the latest to link up with PDVSA. Mobil
announced Friday that it and PDVSA had signed a letter of
intent to study development and upgrading of heavy oil from
the Orinoco belt and other exploration and production
opportunities in Venezuela.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: A little help from their
friends - Venezuela is using foreign investment to develop the nation's
petroleum industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela has announced a Dollars 45.8bn investment programme for its
petroleum industry over the next 10 years that stresses a substantial
increase in crude oil production capacity and the upgrading of oil
refineries to produce higher-quality products.
The plan, which was announced by Mr Gustavo Roosen, president of national
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), assigns a key role to foreign
investment in Venezuela's oil and gas sectors for the first time since the
country nationalised all private oil companies in 1976.
Of the Dollars 48.5bn in projected capital spending, PDVSA plans to invest
Dollars 29.1bn or 60 per cent of the total directly, while private companies
 -mainly foreign investors - are expected to supply the remainder of about
Dollars 19.4bn. Groups such as Royal Dutch/Shell, Exxon, Conoco, Mitsubishi
and Total are already planning large joint-venture projects with PDVSA in
natural gas and heavy oil. And the Venezuelan oil company is actively
seeking new partners for a variety of other projects in oil exploration and
production, refining, petrochemicals and coal.
PDVSA ranks as one of the world's biggest oil companies; at the 1992
year-end it had 63.3bn barrels of crude oil reserves, the largest outside
the Middle East.
One of the main thrusts of the company's investment programme is to develop
crude oil production potential of 4m barrels per day (b/d) by 2002, up 1.1m
b/d from the current capacity of approximately 2.9m b/d.
New exploration work will be carried out in traditional oil production zones
and other areas, and PDVSA's goal is to raise proved reserves of crude oil
to 65bn barrels over the next decade, up 3 per cent from the current level.
International investors are becoming involved in PDVSA's plans through
operating agreements, production sharing and strategic associations.
Under operating agreements, private companies invest to develop production
of crude oil and natural gas in so-called 'marginal fields', or areas with
relatively small volumes of production that PDVSA does not wish to operate
directly. Investors do not own the oil and gas they produce but are
compensated according to production volume.
The first operating agreements were signed in 1992, and earlier this year
British Petroleum agreed to invest around Dollars 60m over the next three
years in a marginal oil field under a 20-year operating agreement.
Using a BP study, PDVSA has also identified sectors in eastern Venezuela
with strong prospects for large discoveries of light and medium-weight
crudes, which Venezuela needs to balance out its existing reserves, now
dominated by heavy crudes.
Next year, PDVSA plans to look for international partners who will assume
all the risks to develop these zones. If commercial quantities of oil are
discovered, PDVSA will share future production with the foreign partner.
Last August, PDVSA received congressional approval to move ahead with two
multi-billion dollar projects to produce and upgrade heavy oil. Conoco,
Total, Itochu and Marubeni are the international partners. The investors
plan to produce heavy and extra-heavy crude from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt (a
large reserve of heavy oil), and use delayed coking to convert it into
lighter-weight, higher-value crude for export. In addition, PDVSA, Shell,
Exxon and Mitsubishi are developing a Dollars 5.6bn project to produce
liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export.
In refining, PDVSA will complete upgrading projects at three of its home
refineries and raise crude processing capacity at these plants and Curacao -
where it leases a former Shell refinery from the government - from the
current level of 1.1m b/d to 1.2m b/d by 2002. That increase will be quite
small in volume terms but the company is investing heavily to upgrade and
modernise the refineries so that they can turn out high-quality,
increased-value, refined products, meeting tougher environmental standards
in the US and other markets.
PDVSA, which already owns, either wholly or jointly, large oil refining
operations in the US and Europe, plans to expand its overseas network
through the acquisition of new refining capacity. The company would not
comment on its acquisition plans, but executives said future marketing
efforts would focus on Latin America and Asia, as well as on expanding
market share in the Caribbean.
In developing their 10-year programme, PDVSA planners are assuming 2 per
cent annual growth in world energy demand during 1992-2002, with projected
demand for hydrocarbons reaching 76m b/d by 2002, up from consumption of 66m
b/d in 1990.
They also assume that potential demand for Venezuelan crude oil on
international markets will rise to about 3.6m b/d in 2002, and to 4.5m b/d
in 2010. Home demand for refined oil products is expected to grow at 2 per
cent a year.
Venezuela's crude oil production last year averaged 2.33m b/d, while exports
of crude and refined products averaged 2.1m b/d, with crude accounting for
1.43m b/d of the total.
A large share of the country's crude oil exports is processed at PDVSA
refineries in the US and Europe.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Venezuelan Congress has approved two oil projects worth a total of
Dollars 4.8bn (Pounds 3.2bn), in which international investors will play an
important role.
The two joint ventures involve the production, upgrading and international
placement of heavy crude oil from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt, the world's
largest accumulation of heavy oil and bitumen.
In both projects, the Venezuelan partner will be Maraven, a subsidiary of
Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA.
Conoco, a unit of EI du Pont de Nemours, will hold 49.9 per cent equity in
one project that calls for total expenditures of Dollars 1.7bn. The
promoters plan to produce 120,000 barrels per day of heavy crude oil and use
a delayed coking process to make lighter crude that can be processed by a
Conoco refinery in the US. Maraven will also have 49.9 per cent equity.
In the other project, which has a projected cost of Dollars 3.1bn, the
international partners will be France's Total and two Japanese companies,
Itochu and Marubeni.
At present, Total is expected to have 40 per cent of equity, Maraven 35 per
cent and two Japanese partners 25 per cent. Maraven said the equity
composition of the projects could change if new international partners were
added.
On August 10, the Congress opened the door to foreign investment in
Venezuela's oil and gas industries for the first time since the 1976
nationalisation.

<TEXT>
   The Venezuelan Energy and Ministry on
Friday denied reports that it had ordered the state oil industry to
raise output to cover Iraq and Kuwait's OPEC quotas.
   ``Until this moment, the minister has not ordered any increase
and our production is still limited to our OPEC quota of 1.945
million barrels per day of crude,'' a ministry spokesman told The
Associated Press.
   ``However, a new order could be given later on, depending on
OPEC agreements,'' he added.
   Venezuela will not make any unilateral hikes, and in any case,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is awaiting word
from Arab leaders on the success of their peace efforts before
changing the level of output, the spokesman said.
   Energy Minister Celestino Armas is in ``constant touch'' with
other OPEC ministers. The cartel has yet to make any decision about
making up for Iraq's 3.1 million barrels per day and Kuwait's 1.5
million, the spokesman said.
   ``But depending on what happens in the Arab world, minister
Armas may make an announcement within a day or two,'' he said.
   Reports from New York and elsewhere had indicated that the state
oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) had already
ordered its subsidiaries to raise output by around 500,000 bpd.
   However, by law, the ministry imparts instructions to PDVSA,
which cannot raise production on its own.
   According to a recent nationwide test, Venezuela has the
capacity to produce between 2.6 and 2.7 million barrels of oil per
day, excluding heavy crudes. Its reserves are sixth in the world,
not counting oil in the Orinoco bitumen belt.
   Venezuela's OPEC limitations have led to friction between the
ministry and PDVSA, which has advocated overproduction to finance a
$20 billion program to expand the oil and petrochemical industries
over the next 10 years.
   A main goal is to raise production capacity to 3.5 million
barrels per day by 1995 and to 4 million by 2000.

   CARACAS -- When he was president of Venezuela in the
mid-1970s, Carlos Andres Perez booted out foreign oil
companies. Now, president again, he is trying to get them
back.
   Mr. Perez makes no apology for the turnaround. Times and
nations have changed, he tells some visiting foreign
journalists over breakfast at the Miraflores Palace here.
"Remember that in the past, warships even came to Venezuela
to claim debts," he says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, Mr. Perez envisions a major new role for foreign
companies -- especially multinationals such as Exxon Corp.
and Royal Dutch/Shell Group, with their technology and deep
pockets -- in a $40 billion-plus plan to speed development of
Venezuela's vast energy base.
   The heart of the expansion plan is a 40% leap in
oil-producing capacity, a net gain of a million barrels a
day, in just five years. "Our goal, and we stand firm on it,
is to produce 3.5 million barrels per day for the year 1995,"
says Mr. Perez.
   Mr. Perez's change of heart is part of a world-wide
pattern. From the Soviet Union to Peru, governments that once
shunned Western oil expertise and capital now are vying to
attract them. The turnaround is especially remarkable in
countries such as Venezuela, where oil is so closely tied to
nationalism. Even now, Mr. Perez may have some persuading to
do at home, where Venezuela's congress still must approve any
direct private roles in oil and gas projects.
   Venezuela's new direction holds particular significance
for the U.S. Venezuela helped found the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, but it long has been a leading
and reliable supplier of oil to the U.S., even during the
Arab oil embargo. Venezuela provides nearly one million
barrels a day, or nearly 7%, of the oil used by the U.S. That
ranks it third as a source of U.S. oil imports, behind only
Saudi Arabia and Canada.
   Among the handful of countries that still have spare
producing capacity -- basically the five founders of OPEC --
only Venezuela is outside the volatile Persian Gulf region.
The others are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and Iran.
   Venezuela's oil reserves are respectable even by Middle
East standards. Its proven conventional crude reserves are
estimated at 60 billion barrels. That is 6% of the world's
total. Counting the Orinoco Belt's huge deposits of
extra-heavy oil, Venezuela's recoverable reserves reach an
astonishing 330 billion barrels. Orinoco's oil is not highly
prized because it is hard to pump, hard to refine and dirty
to burn, but all of those are problems that can best be fixed
with the technology of big oil companies.
   Michael Skol, the U.S. ambassador here, calls Venezuela
"the Saudi Arabia of the Western Hemisphere."
   To get the international oil companies back, however,
President Perez must convince them that Venezuela not only
offers fewer political risks but bigger economic rewards than
other oil lands. It is suddenly a buyers' market for these
oil companies, largely because of the producing nations'
urgent need for more revenue.
   It is generally assumed that oil prices will remain flat,
after adjustments for inflation, over the next several years.
With the oil exporters no longer able to bank on escalating
prices, they must produce more barrels to produce more
income. But their older oil fields are running dry. That
means new technology and substantially more capital are
needed to rejuvenate these fields and develop new ones.
   Even most members of the 13-nation OPEC are reaching for
capital and technical assistance from the oil companies. E.
John P. Browne, British Petroleum Co.'s chief executive for
exploration, estimates that OPEC needs investments of $150
billion to meet the demand for its oil over the next decade.
   BP already is going back into some OPEC countries where
former "concessions" had been expropriated or nationalized.
Only a few weeks ago, it resumed its search for oil in
Nigeria, where operations had been taken over in the 1970s in
a spillover of a political dispute between the Nigerian and
British governments over policies toward South Africa. "Our
breath has been taken away by the speed" in which producing
nations are putting out the welcome mat, Mr. Browne says.
   BP has begun technical studies in Venezuela. It also is
participating in a venture that developed and is marketing a
new boiler fuel -- Orimulsion -- in which water is mixed with
extra-heavy oil from Orinoco in a process that uses an
emulsifier. In addition to BP, four other oil companies have
signed "strategic association" agreements with Petroleos de
Venezuela, or PDVSA, the state-owned oil company, so far this
year. The agreements are designed to lead to possible
joint-venture megaprojects in which the foreign companies
will help build multibillion-dollar refineries in Venezuela
or abroad that can process Orinocotype oil.
   PDVSA, according to its president, Andres Sosa Pietri,
would own less than 50% of each of these associations, in
order to keep them attractive to foreign investors. Also, the
foreign firms may get a crack at exploring for the more
valuable conventional crudes. "The heavy oil is less and less
attractive in today's green-type environment, but if they
give us the linkage of exploring lighter crude areas, it will
change the picture considerably," says an official of one oil
company holding talks with PDVSA.
   Other companies already signed up for the "association"
agreements are Veba A.G. of Germany, Elf Aquitaine of France,
Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi of Italy and Amoco Corp. of the
U.S. Other multinationals and smaller oil companies are
sending technical teams to investigate.
   In addition, a subsidiary of PDVSA and units of Exxon,
Royal Dutch/Shell and Mitsubishi Corp. recently signed a
preliminary development agreement for the huge Cristobal
Colon project. This is a proposed $3 billion liquefied
natural gas project on Venezuela's Paria Peninsula, where
Christopher Columbus first landed in South America.
   The project is still in its early stages -- economic
studies must be done and the congress must approve it before
anything happens -- but Venezuelan oil officials see it as a
test case for the first direct hydrocarbon activity by
foreign firms since the nationalizations.
   President Perez cites Cristobal Colon as the best evidence
of what he calls the "new reality" in relations between
Venezuela and the foreign oil companies. "If need arises to
have objective proof," he says, "we can look at Shell and
Exxon, two nationalized oil companies in our country that
have renegotiated with us."
   In fact, international oil companies, most of them based
in the U.S., were the chief developers of Venezuela's oil
industry, which began when oil was discovered in 1922, and so
much flooded out that world oil prices crashed. But Venezuela
was a world leader in wringing better terms from the oil
companies and, by the 1960s, oil nationalism was beginning to
surge. In 1971, the Venezuelan congress decided that as oil
concessions ended, they wouldn't be renewed, but instead
would revert to the government.
   Although the first concession wasn't due to expire until
1983, the oil companies promptly began to slow their
investments. Venezuela's oil production plunged. That led to
anger toward the companies and set the stage for the 1976
nationalization. Meanwhile, the architect of the
nationalization, Mr. Perez -- then considered Latin America's
leading economic interventionist -- won a landslide
presidential victory.
   During his first term, from 1974 to 1979, the oil bounty
was plentiful. Oil prices were surging, thanks in part to the
1973-74 Arab oil embargo, when Venezuela pumped flat out. Oil
prices were expected to escalate forever. Waste was rampant.
Venezuela spent billions on superhighways and luxury imports.
But then, less than a decade later, the heady days were over.
Oil prices were plunging. Venezuela's market share began
drying up. By the time Mr. Perez became president again, in
1989, Venezuela was nearly bankrupt.
   To provide the harsh medicine Venezuela needed to recover,
Mr. Perez came into office the second time as a free marketer
rather than a free spender, ready to undo what he had wrought
earlier. He reduced tariffs, removed price controls, raised
interest rates and began a painful task of restructuring
through privatization and deregulation. Some banks already
have been privatized. Up for sale are the airline and
telephone companies.
   When Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, once again pointing
up the instability of Middle East oil, Mr. Perez and others
in Venezuela saw an opportunity to attract oil investment
anew.
   Fortunately, President Perez had not burned his bridges to
the oil companies. He had used a pragmatic approach to the
nationalization, which was handled in a businesslike way.
Generally, the oil companies' compensation was considered
fair, although many of the companies grumbled about the
terms.
   Now, a few major oil firms such as Phillips Petroleum Co.
are snubbing Venezuela's overtures. "We have priorities in
other parts of the world," says C. J. Silas, chairman of
Phillips. But one firm indication of the attractions
Venezuela holds for foreign oil companies came this summer
after PDVSA called for "expressions of interest" on a new
program to resurrect washed-out oil fields. That brought more
than 200 inquiries.
   Some of those fields were discovered as long ago as the
1920s and 1930s, and most have been closed for 30 years after
cumulative oil production of 1.4 billion barrels. One PDVSA
official calls them "squeezed oranges." Still, with their
reactivation by foreign firms, "we expect to increase
Venezuela's production by 150,000 to 200,000 barrels a day,"
says Celestino Armas, minister of energy and mines.
   One company interested in the fields is Benton Oil &amp; Gas
Co. of California, a small oil and gas producer. "That is our
niche: old fields that the majors leave behind which still
have enough oil and gas that a company like ours can make a
profit," says Clancy Cottman, a Benton vice president. Also,
he says, Venezuela is a stable country with good relations
with the U.S. and very large oil and gas reserves. "If you
want to be a player there," he says, "it might do you well to
participate" in the marginal fields program.
   In addition, many oil people point out that Venezuela has
the infrastructure that oil companies need -- the roads to
get their rigs in and the pipelines to get the oil out. It
also has a large number of refineries, both at home and in
Europe and the U.S. And, in Petroleos de Venezuela, it has
perhaps the world's most highly regarded and efficient
state-owned oil company.
   Before nationalization, the oil companies were largely
staffed by Venezuelans, and by the time of the
nationalization some 95% of all the employees in the oil
industry -- including many in top management -- were
Venezuelan. As a result, the successor companies were run
essentially as they had been before the nationalization, with
the same people but with a new owner, the Venezuelan
government.
   Since nationalization, PDVSA has tripled Venezuela's
reserves with new finds. Its oil sales now total more than
$14 billion a year. A recent Salomon Brothers report called
PDVSA "the fourth-largest oil conglomerate in the world."
   Oil companies still have some concerns about Venezuela's
internal politics. Bringing in foreign companies remains a
highly charged issue, and the policy reversals of Mr. Perez
aren't being welcomed wholeheartedly in Venezuela. There were
riots when gasoline prices were raised soon after he took
office. Subsidized gasoline prices, still dirt cheap by the
standards of most other countries, continue to increase, but
gradually.
   In addition, there is a hot debate over whether oil policy
should be set by the oil industry or the government. PDVSA's
president, Mr. Sosa Pietri, says the government is just a
shareholder in the industry and should limit its role to
supervision of the budget at the annual meeting. Mr. Armas,
the oil minister, sees it differently. "The ministry is not
the manager of the {oil} industry, but the controller who
sets the policy," he says.
   Foreign companies are watching. "The politics casts a
little fresh doubt on the Venezuelan deals," says an official
of one major oil company, "but everything wouldn't crater if
Sosa Pietri lost his job tomorrow."
   Mr. Perez will likely have the last word. He appointed
both men. "There is no dispute," he says.

   The current combination of stagnant world demand for oil and excess production capacity is forcing Venezuela to look beyond its oil sector for growth. 

   The state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, has allocated more than $4.6 billion for 1986-90 to developing other energy resources such as petrochemicals, natural gas, coal and bitumen. 
For the same period, the company budgeted $4.7 billion for domestic oil exploration and development and $1 billion for upgrading oil refineries. 

   "We don't see a big increase coming in oil demand by the end of this decade," Pablo Reimpell, Petroleos' vice president, said in a telephone interview. 
"But we can look to areas like petrochemicals as a place to improve profitability." 

   Venezuela's oil income fell 44% last year to $7.2 billion from $12.86 billion in 1985, according to government figures. 
Its oil exports averaged 1,534,000 barrels a day last year at an average price of $13.90 a barrel. 
In 1985, output was smaller, averaging 1,371,000 barrels a day, but the average price was almost twice as high, at $25.89 a barrel. 

   Oil prices are expected to remain stable this year at higher levels than in 1986. 
But Venezuela's oil production is restricted by an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries quota agreement to 1,495,000 barrels a day. 
At that production rate, the country's oil income couldn't recover to its 1985 level unless prices averaged more than $23 a barrel, and there is no sign of that happening. 

   Among the non-oil sectors, Petroleos has earmarked the largest amount of capital for expansion of its petrochemical industry. 
In contrast to its declining oil revenue, the company's petrochemical sales rose 24% last year to about $559 million. 
Petrochemical export volume jumped 45% last year from 1985, while domestic sales rose 25%. 

   A $1.5 billion investment program for the petrochemicals sector has been approved by the government through 1992, according to Petroleos. 
Combined with private capital infusions, the sector is likely to see investment of more than $2 billion, Jack Tarbes, a Petroleos vice president, said recently. 

   Meanwhile, the state also plans to invest $1.4 billion to expand its natural gas network. 

   Venezuela has 55 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves, about 11% of the total in the Western Hemisphere. 
Petroleos estimates current demand for natural gas in the country at 1.8 billion cubic feet a day and projects that this could rise to 3.2 billion by the end of the century. 

   To meet demand, Venezuela will expand its gas-pipeline system from the eastern part of the country to Lake Maracaibo, a major oil and gas reserve area in western Venezuela. 

   The pipeline project, scheduled for completion around 1990, would be the first to link the gas reserves in the west with two major power plants in central Venezuela and the industrial facilities in the eastern part of the country. 

   Petroleos also hopes the project will eventually boost exports of liquefied petroleum gas, according to Emma Brossard, a consultant to the company and a director of the Center for Energy Studies at Louisiana State University. 

   Over the next five years, Petroleos also will look for growth opportunities through new energy industries, officials say. 
One example is orimulsion, a low-cost industrial fuel being tested by the company's research affiliate, Intevep. 

   Orimulsion is made by mixing bitumen -- the heavy oil tar sands found in Venezuela's oil-rich Orinoco belt -- with water and additives to make it more easily transportable. 

   Petroleos and U.S. utility officials say that once fully tested, orimulsion could become a competing fuel to coal and residual fuel oil. 
Petroleos has earmarked $180 million for development of the experimental fuel between now and 1992. 

   And while it is working on this potential competitor to coal, Petroleos also plans to invest more than $870 million in domestic coal production by the end of the 1980s. 

   Its coal company, Carbozulia, recently signed a preliminary development agreement with ACC Venezuela Inc., an affiliate of Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., and Agip Carbone, an affiliate of the Italian energy holding company Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, to develop an open-pit bituminous coal mine in Guasare, 330 miles west of Caracas, Venezuela's capital. 
The Guasare area is believed to hold bituminous coal deposits of 470 million tons. 

   Carbozulia President Luis Urdenata said the initial cost of building the mine and related facilities would be around $455 million. 
He said the foreign joint-venture partners would contribute about 48%. 

   Initial production at the mine is projected to begin in the last quarter of this year, with full production by 1995. 

   Mr. Tarbes of Petroleos says the move into the coal business could assist, rather than conflict with, the fledgling orimulsion program. 

   "By getting into the coal business," he says, "we will be more expert in a market where orimulsion will need to compete."

VENEZUELA'S production of crude oil in 1991 averaged 2.488m barrels a day,
the highest level on record since the country's petroleum industry was
nationalised in 1976, official sources said in Caracas.
The 1991 production figure, which includes crude oil and small proportions
of condensates and natural gas liquids, represents an increase of nearly 11
per cent over 1990 production of 2.249m b/d. Exports of crude oil and
refined products in 1991 averaged 2.08m b/d, up more than 10 per cent from
the previous year's average of 1.88m b/d.
Venezuela's proven reserves of crude oil totalled 62.8bn barrels at the end
of 1991, up 5 per cent from a year earlier. This means that Venezuela
continues to hold the largest proved reserves of crude oil in the Western
Hemisphere, even without including the country's very large deposits of
extra heavy oil located in the Orinoco Belt.

<F P=106> [Report by Gregorio Salazar] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez admitted 
yesterday, upon returning from the United States, that a 
significant portion of the funds obtained as a result of 
currency devaluation will be used to pay the foreign debt. As 
Minister Sosa was about to get into his car, which by the way 
has a private license plate, he was approached by a reporter who 
asked: 
  [Unidentified Reporter] What will the government do with the 
additional income obtained from the sale of dollars? 
  [Sosa] Well, there are various aspects. First of all, the 
Central Bank of Venezuela [BCV] is trying to reduce liquidity 
through the zero coupon bond mechanism and is trying to 
establish a more permanent method. On the other hand, you must 
remember that our budgets include foreign debt servicing which 
must be paid in dollars, which means that it will cost us more 
bolivares. So we already know where those bolivares will go. 
  [Reporter] Can those bolivares be used to pay the debt? 
  [Sosa] Obviously ... 
  Previously, Sosa had answered several questions from 
reporters who inquired about the differences between the 
auctioning of dollars and foreign exchange controls. "The 
auctioning of dollars and foreign exchange controls are two 
completely different things. The word auction itself implies 
that there are no controls, because I understand it means that 
you can offer `two,' I can offer `three,' and another person can 
offer `two and a half.' Controls would mean that if I say `two' 
that is it." 
  Sosa said there will be no alternate to the BCV as a source 
of dollars. 
  [Reporter] Is the BCV also trying to control the large 
number 
of dollars being sold? 
  [Sosa] Evidently, it is trying to handle this -- price and 
volume -- step by step. I believe, however, that it is being 
handled beyond the normal needs. 
  He had previously been asked whether the mechanism to 
auction 
foreign exchange would be permanent or temporary. "I think it 
will last for some time. BCV is always trying to establish the 
measures that best fit the circumstances. For instance, the 
system the bank used a little more than a year ago, the 
"crawling peg standard" -- I do not know how to translate that, 
it sounds like a spider climbing a wall -- was different from 
the one used previously. The new mechanism fits reality more 
closely, and I think it will work just fine. 
  Sosa turned philosophical when he was asked what he had 
meant 
when he said the auctioning of U.S. dollars would be permanent. 
"God is the only permanent concept in life. All of the material 
things and man do not last forever, and whoever says the 
opposite is wrong. I meant that the system would last one year, 
maybe longer." 
  Someone told him that, according to National Convergence 
Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui, auctioning is the best exchange 
control. "Well, I will ask him to explain that to me when I see 
him." 
  Sosa expressed confidence in the auction mechanism 
established by BCV. He regards the system as convenient because 
financial markets are gradually returning to tranquillity. 
According to the finance minister, the Economic Cabinet 
discussed his trip to Washington and divided the cabinet into 
four sectors: political, social, infrastructure, and economic. 
  He said that in the United States, he met people willing to 
enter joint ventures with CVG [Venezuelan Guayana Corporation] 
in aluminum and steel manufacturing. He also thinks that another 
plant for manufacturing methanol for export could be built in 
Venezuela. Sosa, who is always optimistic, confidently expects 
inflation to decline and interest rates to fall by the end of 
the year. 
  Later, he said flatly that Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. 
[PDVSA] 
will not be privatized. "There are very good possibilities for 
foreign capital, with technology, resources, and market 
potential, to join PDVSA subsidiaries in certain projects." A 
very large investment is required in the Orinoco Strip, Orinoco 
Delta, eastern Monagas, and the southern Sucre projects, which 
are open for investment. "This does not mean that PDVSA 
subsidiaries or PDVSA itself will be privatized," he said. 
  Asked how international reserves will be affected, he 
answered: "Let us hope that trust will make them increase. I do 
not think this system will affect the reserves. If they are 
affected in any way, it will be for the better."

   NEW YORK -- Venezuela expects within the next few months
to have completed steps to facilitate foreign investment in
its oil and petrochemical industries, said Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. president, Andres Sosa Pietri.
   At a luncheon of the Venezuelan American Association in
New York last week, Mr. Sosa Pietri said the state oil
company is seeking to encourage foreign investment in an
effort to triple capacity in the next five years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government is sponsoring a bill in Congress to permit
foreign involvement in a proposed $3.5 billion liquefied
natural gas project, Mr. Sosa Pietri said. That project,
which is expected to require the development of offshore gas
reserves, would be an important new outlet for Venezuela's
106 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
   Mr. Sosa Pietri said that five or six foreign companies
have made firm offers to join a Petroleos affiliate in the
project. A feasibility study is expected to be completed by
the end of May.
   Foreign participation in the Venezuelan oil industry has
been strictly limited since its nationalization during
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez's previous
administration. But after his re-election in late 1988,
President Perez embarked on an economic overhaul package
intended to reduce the country's heavy foreign debt and
stimulate the local economy. That program has included
encouraging private sector participation in key industries,
allowing the market to set the exchange rate for the bolivar,
and lifting price controls on many goods.
   The encouragement of foreign investment in the energy
sector is still controversial in Venezuela, and some analysts
have expressed doubts that Congress would move proposals
through as fast as Mr. Sosa Pietri thinks they will.
   High tax rates are one obstacle to foreign investment that
the government is hoping to alleviate. Corporations are
generally taxed at a rate of 48%, while Petroleos struggles
under a composite tax burden of 82%. He said Congress is
considering legislation that would lower the corporate tax
rate to 35%.
   To help with plans to increase crude oil production
capacity, Venezuela also is considering revising rules that
prevent foreign participation in the upstream sector of
Venezuela's oil industry, Mr. Sosa Pietri said. New rules
could come by mid-May, he said.
   He didn't specify how the rules would be revised other
than to say that they wouldn't include concessions, which
aren't allowed by the constitution. However, he said
Petroleos hopes for "joint ventures from exploration all the
way through downstream."
   Venezuela also plans to expand its production of
orimulsion, a bitumen and water blend that competes with coal
at a price of about $5 a barrel, Mr. Sosa Pietri said. "A
series of agreements" will put exports at 100,000 barrels a
day by 1992, he said. That blend, developed by Petroleos and
the British Petroleum Co., will enable Venezuela to take
advantage of its 230 billion barrels of bitumen reserves in
Orinoco.
   Regarding Petroleos itself, he said that there is a
reorganization under way to "enhance the role of Petroleos as
a holding company, not an operating company," and to
strengthen the role of the affiliates.
   The Petroleos chief took pains to emphasize that Venezuela
sees its economic future tied to the health of the economies
of the U.S., Europe, and Japan, its main markets. Price
shocks aren't in Venezuela's interest, he stressed. "We
believe in price increases . . . that go along with world
inflation levels."
   Mr. Sosa Pietri said he didn't think that Venezuela's
membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would hamstring its plans to increase crude-oil
production capacity beyond its present OPEC quota. As demand
outstrips OPEC production capacity, the need for quotas will
disappear, Mr. Sosa Pietri said.
   Mr. Sosa Pietri, a Harvard University Law School graduate
who spent his career as a self-described "entrepreneur in
medium-sized companies" dealing with international markets,
also addressed the outcry accompanying his appointment.
President Perez was criticized for appointing an outsider to
the company, but Mr. Sosa Pietri said it reflected the
president's commitment to encouraging the private sector and
maintaining Petroleos as a commercial entity.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 21 June. 
  The Banco de Maracaibo intervention board believes it is 
still possible to rescue this failing financial institution. The 
intervention board has completed a Banco de Maracaibo rescue 
plan that will be presented before the Banking 
Superintendency--the agency responsible for making a final 
decision on the issue. If the intervention board's plan is 
accepted, Banco de Maracaibo could begin operating again some 
time before 29 June--the date when Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and 
Banking Protection Fund] is scheduled to reinstate additional 
losses of 7.2 billion bolivares. According to the intervention 
board, Banco de Maracaibo is in a position to reimburse Fogade 
all of the 120 billion bolivares it has received in financial 
assistance so far. (Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200 
GMT 20 Jun 94) 
  The banking liquidity coefficient has fallen to 30.6 
percent. 
The coefficient, which measures cash availability in terms of 
total funds deposited in banks, was 30.6 percent in May. This 
means that for every 100 bolivares deposited by the public, the 
banking system is in a position to immediately provide slightly 
more than 30 bolivares. (Caracas Union Radio in Spanish 1245 GMT 
20 Jun 94) 
  According to Charles Roccia, vice president of Banco 
Provincial de Venezuela, a financing agreement was signed on 15 
June with a syndicate of Portuguese banks headed by Banco de 
Fomento de Portugal. The terms of the agreement include a $20 
million line of credit to be used to finance clients of 
Venezuelan banks who wish to import products from Portugal. Mr. 
Roccia pointed out that the agreement is very significant, 
particularly at this time, because it shows Portugal's 
confidence in the Venezuelan banking system. (Caracas EL GLOBO 
in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p 12) 
  In Caracas, state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum (PDVSA) has 
announced that Venezuela will begin selling orimulsion, boiler 
fuel made from heavy oil comprising 70 percent bitumen and 30 
percent water, in the Chinese market as result of a recent 
agreement signed between the North Industries Shenzhen 
Corporation and PDVSA's Bitumenes del Orinoco subsidiary. The 
agreement includes the supply of orimulsion for an electrical 
plant scheduled to begin operations in 1995. The Venezuelan 
company will be responsible to market, sale, and supply the 
orimulsion, as well as providing technical assistance to the 
client. (Paris AFP in Spanish 2018 GMT 20 Jun 94) 
  Recently released figures from the Central Statistics and 
Data Processing Office show that imports totaled $2.649 billion 
in the first quarter of the year, reflecting a 31.9 percent drop 
from the same period in 1993. The report also shows that 46.1 
percent of all imports originated in the United States; 7.1 
percent from Germany; 7.0 percent from Japan; 4.6 percent from 
Colombia; 4.2 percent from Italy; 3.2 percent from Brazil; and 
3.0 percent from France. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 16 Jun

   Environmentalists are concerned
that a quest for gold, uranium and other minerals threatens severe
damage to Venezuela's Amazon and the way of life of the territory's
12 Indian tribes.
   The territory of about 70,000 square miles of jungle and granite
is an an extension of Brazil's Amazon, already exploited and damaged
by the clearing of rain forests for development and by wildcat
mining.
   The mighty Orinoco River forms in Venezuela's Federal Amazonas
Territory and makes its way eastward to the Caribbean Sea.
   But the territory also contains precious minerals in its soil and
riverbeds, mainly gold and uranium, and the quest for them and the
riches they bring threatens a fragile ecosystem and the last of the
forest Indians whose way of life goes back millenia.
   Most of the territory is unexplored, and studies of its mineral
riches are mere estimates.
   Venezuela declared the Amazonas region a federal reserve in 1972,
off limits to all economic development projects.
   But, in apparent contradiction of the laws, the Ministry of Mines
in Caracas, the nation's capital, has granted concessions to some
miners operating inside the territory's three national parks and
other concessions to gold buyers.
   At the same time, the Ministry of the Environment has been
accused of catering to ``developmentalists,'' those who would like
to see Venezuela reap economic benefits from its land.
   Environmentalists complained in January when the government of
then-President Jaime Lusinchi gave the Guayana Venezuela Corp. the
rights to begin development projects in mining and other industries
in previously virgin Amazonas.
   The corporation, known by its Spanish initials CVG, is a state
entity that has monopolized iron, aluminum and gold exploitation in
nearby Bolivar state in southeastern Venezuela.
   The Lusinchi government's decree gives CVG power to move Indians
from their villages when deemed necessary and it has even asked
Indian leaders to work with it in cataloguing the region's potential
riches.
   The CVG plans to create extensive mining zones and rubber tapping
plantations, claims Aida Santana, head of Caracas Central
University's ``Amazonas Project.''
   Under the project students travel by river canoe into remote
Indian villages to spend months as part of their training in
medicine, anthropology, biology and other specialties.
   Santana maintains that the CVG's development plans would create
in Amazonas another ``Kilometer 88,'' an infamous strip of
malaria-and vice-ridden gold mines in Bolivar state.
   CVG denies that it plans unbalanced development of the region,
saying it will incorporate environmental impact reports into its
plans.
   However, Santana said: ``Any plans for exploitation of the
Amazonas are not justified. The resources are non-renewable, and
their exploitation is not worth the human sacrifice, and the
extinction of fauna and flora we have not even begun to study.''
   But the concerns of environmentalists may have become known too
late.
   Signs in Puerto Ayacucho, the capital of the territory with a
population of 40,000 along the Orinoco River, already advertise to
buy gold.
   Indians have moved to Puerto Ayacucho from their forest homes and
roam the streets at night after frequenting drinking establishments.
   Much of the mining in the territory's national parks, especially
in Yapacana Park at the confluence of the Orinoco and Ventuari
rivers, is done by Indians, generally of the Piaroa and Guajibo
ethnic groups, said Rafael Garcia of the National Parks Institute.
   ``The Indians usually use rudimentary mining techniques, such as
picks and shovels and sieves,'' he said. ``But the `creoles'
(Venezuelans of mixed blood) who travel down to barter gold usually
rip them off.''
   Garcia added that in addition to exploiting the Indian miners,
outsiders were using mercury to extract gold from riverbeds,
poisoning the water and causing extensive damage to wildlife and the
Indians themselves.
   Roman Catholic missionaries in the southeast of the territory,
home to roughly 9,000 Yanomami Indians who also inhabit areas of
Brazil, recently blamed gold miners for the deaths by mercury
poisoning of some 100 Yanomami children.
   An invasion of about 3,000 Brazilian gold wildcatters into the
Venezuelan Amazon at the headwaters of the Orinoco created a public
outcry in April.
   The Brazilians were eventually airlifted by Venezuelan and
Brazilian military craft back to Brazil, but not before they caused
extensive damage to the headwaters.
   The Brazilians dredged riverbeds and cut down all vegetation
within 600 feet of the river. Scientists estimated the damage would
take hundreds of years to repair.
   The public outrage, not only over the environmental damage but
the assault on national ``sovereignty,'' led for calls for the
creation of a national park along the Sierra de Parima and the
headwaters of the Orinoco, and the use of national guard troops and
student volunteers to man the park system in Amazonas.

<F P=106> [Article by Ana Diaz] </F>
  [Text] China is a very important client for sales of 
Orimulsion (R) and negotiations with Bitumenes del Orinoco 
(Bitor), PDVSA's [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] marketing 
subsidiary for the fuel, have been concluded with agreement on 
the export to China of 5 million tons a year over the next five 
years, according to Carlos Borregales, the company's director. 
Beginning in 1995, the thermoelectric plant at Daga will use 1.2 
million tons of the fuel. 
  Borregales, together with the president of Intevep 
[Institute 
of Venezuelan Petroleum Technology], Gustavo Inciarte, and the 
manufacturing director of Venezuelan Petroleum, Otto Martinez, 
explained to the Finance Commission of the Senate, chaired by 
Virgilio Avila Vivas, measures taken by Venezuela to prevent 
protectionist treatment against Orimulsion (the United Kingdom) 
and reformulated gasolines (the United States). The Bitor 
executive was optimistic that the fuel's classification as a 
natural bitumen would prevail at the Council on Customs Matters 
that will meet for four weeks beginning 4 April. 
  The classification of Orimulsion (R) as a natural bitumen 
has 
an excellent chance of being approved by the Council on Customs 
Matters, especially as the organization approved the technical 
report last week. The thermoelectric generating fuel, a product 
of Venezuelan technology by Intevep, would thus not be subject 
to taxes. 
  About 100 countries will participate in the meeting, of 
which 
74 have the right to a voice and a vote, Venezuela being one of 
those with the right only to a voice. According to Borregales, 
the report with the technical data to support Orimulsion's 
classification as a natural bitumen is being sent to embassies 
for transmittal to their governments, so that they may have 
advance knowledge of the material prior to the April meeting. 
  Venezuela will request that Orimulsion be addressed during 
the second week of the council's meeting. Classification as a 
natural bitumen has an excellent probability of being approved 
by the 74 members of the council, among them the United States, 
Japan, Korea, and several European countries that gave their 
approval during the technical-scientific phase last week. 
Classification of Orimulsion as a natural bitumen (code 2714) is 
an important step in marketing the fuel in the old continent 
without facing protectionist barriers, halting the United 
Kingdom's offensive. 
  On 31 January 1994, the United Kingdom announced the 
application of a $10 per ton tax on the fuel next June, if the 
council decided to classify Orimulsion as a refined petroleum 
product (code 2715). Great Britain had pressed for the fuel to 
be classified a refined product during 1993, and that position 
halted negotiations for the sale of 3 million additional tons to 
major British electric companies. 
  Pressure from the United Kingdom resulted in Orimulsion's 
production at less than installed capacity (5 million tons) in 
Morichal. This caused losses to Bitor, said Borregales, although 
the firm's cash flow last year closed in balance. 
  Despite British pressure, the natural bitumen classification 
has majority support in the European Community because, of the 
76 votes that the 12 member countries possess, 43 are favorable 
to Venezuela and 33 are opposed. Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, 
Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium, with five, 
10, eight, five, five, two, five, and three votes, respectively, 
support Venezuela, while Great Britain, Germany, France (10 
votes each), and Ireland (three votes) are opposed. 
  Orimulsion exports have been growing, and while sales 
reached 
721,000 tons in 1992, last year they totalled 2.79 million tons 
with a value of $65,676,600 at a promotional price of $23.54 per 
ton. PDVSA's Business Plan 1993-2002 provides for the export of 
24 million tons of the fuel during the final year, with 
investments of $1.3 billion.

   New Brunswick Electric Power Commission said it signed the
first long-term North American contract for Venezuelan liquid
bitumen, a low-cost fuel produced from the vast deposits of
tar sands in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt.
   New Brunswick Power, owned by New Brunswick province,
signed a multimillion-dollar contract with Bitor America
Corp., a unit of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, to
purchase as much as 16,000 barrels a day of liquid bitumen
for 20 years. The utility will use the fuel, which has the
trade name Orimulsion, as power-plant fuel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New Brunswick Power said it will spend 338 million
Canadian dollars (US$291.6 million) over the next four years
to convert a power plant to burn Orimulsion. It will install
a new smokestack scrubber to reduce emissions produced from
burning the bitumen, which has a high sulfur content.
Orimulsion is a mixture of water and extra-heavy bitumen, a
tarlike crude. Like conventional crude, Orimulsion can be
shipped by tanker or pipeline, but costs less than half the
price.

<TEXT>
Not everybody was pleased by the appointment of Julio Sosa as Venezuela's
new finance minister, writes Joseph Mann. One left-wing opposition
politician suggested, in the charming manner that characterises Venezuelan
politics, that putting Sosa at the head of the finance ministry was like
'putting a vulture in charge of dead meat'.
Others have a higher opinion. Some businessmen and investors felt that Sosa
could emerge as a defender of free market policies or, at the very least,
could steer the new government away from economic blunders.
He will have his work cut out. As President Rafael Caldera began his
five-year term last Wednesday, Venezuela faces a profound economic crisis:
the economy is in recession and inflation rising. The government is short of
money because of the low price of oil and the country's second largest bank
collapsed last month.
Sosa has been close to the new president for decades, both as an adviser and
a friend. Caldera admits he is not an expert in economy and finance, and
will rely heavily on Sosa's opinions.
During the first Caldera presidency from 1969-74, Sosa refused a cabinet
position, but worked as ambassador to Washington. A father of nine children,
Sosa graduated in petroleum engineering in 1945. He studied at Cornell and
Oklahoma Universities in the US, as well as at Venezuela's Central
University.
He was born into a wealthy Venezuelan family and, after working as a
petroleum engineer and an academic, became a successful entrepreneur. He
founded and ran Industrias Venoco, a lubricants company, and set up a
commercial bank (Banco Orinoco) and an insurance company (Seguros Orinoco).
On his first day in office, Sosa was asked for his plans. He replied: 'Well,
I'm going to try to start doing what I'll be asking everyone else to do -
cutting costs.'

<HL> Venezuela Boosts Oil-Reserve Estimate,
Hoping for Larger OPEC Output Quota

<TEXT>
   Venezuela has nearly doubled the estimate of its proven oil reserves in the hope of winning a bigger output quota from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 

   But analysts say that the revision, which on paper catapults the South American nation to fourth place from No. 10 in oil reserves world-wide, is unlikely to make much headway in persuading its OPEC partners to give it a bigger share. 

   At the end of 1986, the state-run oil concern Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. recalculated the country's proven reserves at 55 billion barrels, up from the 29.5 billion barrels it claimed in 1985. 

   The greatest part of the increase resulted from the near-quadrupling of the estimated extractable reserves from the Orinoco deposit in Eastern Venezuela, to 18 billion barrels from five billion. 
The remaining eight billion extra barrels were attributed to new finds and improvements in extracting methods at existing fields. 

   Industry sources say the revision was justified and overdue. 
Neverthless, Venezuela clearly hopes the higher figure will give it an edge in talks that have been going on since mid-1985 within OPEC to establish a new, "scientific" formula for setting production quotas under its system of restricting overall output to boost prices. 

   What has emerged in the OPEC discussions so far is a consensus that the size of a country's oil reserves ought to be the main ingredient in determining its production ceiling. (Other countries, such as Nigeria, which has low reserves but a huge population, have argued for taking social and economic factors into consideration.) 

   Thus, Venezuela, like Iraq, which previously boosted its reserve estimates, is believed to be attempting to stake a claim for higher quotas if the oil group ever comes up with a new formula. 

   Bankers also say Venezuela may be hoping to use enlarged reserves as collateral in debt-repayment talks with banks. 
It is renegotiating $21 billion of foreign debt, out of a total $32 billion owed, following last year's 40% plunge in oil income. 

   "The basic thrust of the increase is political," one Caracas oil expert says. 
"By almost doubling reserves they (oil officials) have increased their weight in figuring quotas. 
They are staking an early claim to increased production." 

   Adds Felix Rossi Guerrero, Venezuela's chief representative to OPEC, "If eventually (the cartel) decides to apply a formula which includes proven reserves, the new level of reserves would be helpful to Venezuela." 

   Analysts are skeptical, however, that the maneuver will pay off. 
"It's an exercise in futility," says Alberto Quiros Corradi, former president of Petroleos de Venezuela's Lagoven operating subsidiary and currently director of the Caracas-based newspaper El Nacional. 
"I doubt very much that (OPEC) will arrive at such a formula." 

   At a December OPEC conference, Venezuela accepted a 79,000-barrel cutback in daily output to 1,495,000 barrels for the first half of 1987. 
Since then, it has increased oil prices several times, and hopes to get an average $15.68 dollars a barrel for the year, up from $12.89 in 1986.

  [Text] Anibal Martinez, president of the Pro-Venezuela 
Association, said that, unfortunately for our country, the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency's discriminatory decision 
against the 8 million liters of reformulated gasoline that 
Venezuela exports every day has coincided with the European 
Economic Community nomenclature committee's examination of 
Orimulsion's classification. Orimulsion is a new fuel developed 
by Venezuela that can be burned to generate electricity 
directly. This natural bitumen is obtained at our Faja del 
Orinoco site. 
  [Begin recording] [Moreno] Could you tell us Pro-Venezuela's 
reasons for rejecting the discriminatory actions against 
Orimulsion by the United States and the UK? 
  [Martinez] We are presenting a strong protest to the U.S. 
and 
UK Governments, through their respective embassies in the 
country, for the discriminatory treatment given, in the case of 
the United States, to the reformulated gasoline we export to 
that country, and in the case of the UK, for the unfriendly 
actions of the government against Orimulsion. The UK took an 
internal policy problem to the European Union and requested that 
Orimulsion, a new fuel developed by Venezuela, be inaccurately 
classified. [end recording]

Venezuela: Plenty of Oil on the Shelf</HL>

PETROLEUM (PET) </IN>
<TEXT>
   Re your May 1 article, "U.S. 
Begins to Take Notice as Venezuela Lifts Its Estimate of Proven Oil Reserves": 

   Not long ago Venezuela was the prime stereotype of an old played-out oil province. 
Reserves were "running out," as all over the world; soon we would be back begging at the Persian Gulf. 

   But the "running out" of reserves reflected only the lack of an inducement to invest. 
There had been no new private concessions since 1956, and nationalization was expected long before it came in 1976. 
Hence exploration went to near-zero, and development to a minimum. 
After a brief post-nationalization euphoria, drilling picked up, with the usual results. 

   "Proved reserves" are ready shelf inventory, oil connected to facilities in place and paid for. 
"Probable" or semi-proved reserves are warehouse inventory, amount and cost to be "guesstimated." 
Behind them lies the unworked quarry, with a large but undefined amount. 

   The Venezuelans started, at nationalization, with 15 billion barrels proved. 
They added another 18 billion in 11 years, offset by eight billion produced. 
They could have added more, if they had invested more. 
The great bulk of reserves added were in old fields, as is normal. 
New-found fields are credited, properly, with only small reserves because not much has been developed. 

   There is much more back in the warehouse (probable or semi-proved reserves), and it should not be lumped in with shelf inventory. 
By year's end, we will have some published unofficial industry estimates of how much is in each class. 

   But the Orinoco Belt is a separate province, with three trillion barrels in place. 
It took a lot of Venezuelan money and brainwork to make some of it a potential asset. 
If, as President Chacin of Petroleos de Venezuela has now revealed, current capacity to produce and -- more important -- to upgrade is about 150,000 barrels daily, the proved reserve probably does not exceed one billion barrels. 
Large amounts of it, perhaps 267 billion barrels, could be profitably developed at perhaps $4 a barrel. 
But very little will be, because Venezuela is part of a cartel that must restrain output in order to keep up the price. 

   Venezuela needs plenty of excess capacity, hence excess reserves, because without it, it gets no respect from its fellow cartelists, and a smaller quota. 
Its purchase of refinery and marketing outlets is a permanent netback agreement, which guarantees that it sells its full quota every month. 
And if the cartel finally disappears, which is far from being the case now, the country is in good condition to save as much as possible from the wreck by being poised to invest to expand production manifold to get higher revenues at lower prices. 

   So both claims are true: Venezuela has many times as much oil as Saudi Arabia, but it has only a fraction of Saudi proved reserves. 
What matters for reserves and capacity is, again, the inducement to invest, which is now very low in both countries because demand for cartel oil will stay low even at current "low" prices. 
And oil supply is insecure from both countries because the world oil market is one great pool. 
Threats to supply in any place make it scarce and high priced in every place. 

   There is, however, a delicious unintended irony in the statement of "U.S. energy officials . . . {not} yet suggesting that Venezuelan oil imports be increased." 
It's time they learned that it's not for them to suggest anything. 
Nobody is listening, and oil exporters will export only enough to maximize their revenues, as best they can guess them.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from La Guaira, </F>
Venezuela] 
  [Text] On 4 March, at the presidential summer residence "La 
Guzmania" near Caracas, Brazilian President Itamar Franco and 
his Venezuelan counterpart Rafael Caldera created a high-level 
binational commission that will be subdivided into various work 
groups to deal with the following issues: 
  -- Conclude the pavement of the BR 174 highway, and expand 
the agreement on land transportation. Brazil will pave 200 km 
of the highway linking Boa Vista with Santa Elena de Uairen. 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Venezuela could 
cooperate by supplying the asphalt. 
  -- The electric sector: Brazil will purchase energy from 
Venezuela and will build the transmission lines. Interim Mines 
and Energy Minister Jose Israel Vargas said the idea is to get 
electricity for Manaus from the Guri electric plant. He also 
said discussions are being held for an exchange between Guri and 
the Balbina hydroelectric plant, because the two countries have 
weather problems. 
  -- The hydrographic sector: study the possibility of 
navigation between the Orinoco and Amazon river basins. 
President Franco said during a news conference that he 
discussed with President Caldera the interconnection of the 
Orinoco and Amazon river basins, which have an extension of 
approximately 11,000 km. The studies began in 1943. Franco 
said that what the two governments have in mind is to continue 
the studies with the objective of "reaching the River Plate 
basin." 
  -- The mineral sector: The two governments will study the 
possibility of carrying out compatible joint projects regarding 
sustainable development and the protection of the indigenous 
communities. The cooperation agreement signed in 1991 between 
the Rio Doce Valley Company (CVRD) and the Venezuelan 
Corporation of Guayana (CVG) will be useful for the development 
of such projects. Israel Vargas commented that the two countries 
are studying the possibility of using manganese from Carajas in 
Venezuelan electric furnaces. The objective is to produce iron 
alloys for the Venezuelan steel industry. He also reported that 
studies are being made for joint gold prospecting, to develop 
the border regions and employ gold prospectors in legal and 
orderly activities. 
  -- The environmental sector: joint development of ecological 
tourism, scientific research on biodiversity, and cooperation 
for recovering the deteriorated areas caused by illegal mining. 
The illegal activities in the border regions were mentioned in 
the joint communique signed by the two presidents. It says: 
"The presidents agreed on the need to fight any illegal 
activities on their common border with determination. With that 
objective they commit themselves to the reinforcement of 
appropriate measures for the eradication of illegal mineral 
prospecting in the border zones, and to carry out an effective 
control over the use of equipment and other components used in 
prospecting that contribute to the depredation and contamination 
of the environment." 
  Bolivar State Governor Andres Velasco of the Radical Cause, 
a 
leftist party that came out third in last year's presidential 
elections, said: "The Brazilian Government must reverse its 
position regarding the gold prospectors." He also said the gold 
prospectors are involved in drug trafficking. He added: "It is 
possible they are also being used by the multinationals as 
spearheads for mineral prospecting." 
  -- The Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System] project: 
The Venezuelan Government is studying Brazilian participation 
in carrying out ecological-economic zoning. 
  -- The hemispheric summit: The two presidents expressed 
their hopes for the upcoming summit, to be held in the United 
States this year. The two countries will make joint efforts to 
have the agenda reflect an effective hemispheric consensus. 
  -- Economic complementation agreement: The two governments 
will expedite negotiations for reaching an agreement within the 
framework of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). 
"Such an agreement could also include, in addition to the 
reduction of trade barriers, incentive measures for border 
trade, for promoting investment protection, for facilitating the 
trade of services, for protecting intellectual property, and 
regulations for preventing unfair competition and access to 
public biddings."

<TEXT>
   A military transport plane crashed and
exploded in the hills west of the capital shortly after takeoff
Tuesday morning, killing all 24 people aboard, officials said.
   Investigators said fog and rain was probably to blame for the
crash of the Spanish-built twin-engine Aviocar, which was carrying
13 Venezuelan navy men, eight civilians and three crew.
   Rescue officials said the craft, en route to a port on the
Orinoco River, crashed just outside the hamlet of La Sabaneta
(Little Blanket) 15 miles west of Caracas.
   The pilot apparently was able to maneuver the plane at the last
moment to crash in a deserted area rather than strike houses in the
poor neighborhood, according to preliminary reports by Civil
Defense officials.
   The airplane had just taken off from Caracas's Simon Bolivar
International Airport on a flight to Puerto Ayacucho, on the
Orinoco 400 miles south of Caracas. The military personnel were to
serve at an outpost near the Brazilian border.
   ``With the fog in those hills, it must have been hard for them,
even with radar,'' said Antonio Vargas, an official with civil
defense crews working in the clean-up operation.
   A man living nearby said the plane was ``flying low. ... It
didn't sound like motor trouble.''
   Residents rushed to the scene but the flames and repeated
explosions kept them from approaching the plane. Firefighters
quickly extinguished the blaze.
   So far, 19 bodies have been recovered by rescue workers, most of
them burned beyond recognition, officials said. Among the bodies
were two women and a child, presumably military dependents.
   ``We brought three ambulances up here immediately, but all we've
found are corpses,'' said Mercedes Vivas, a doctor with Caracas
firefighters.
   National guard troops, firefighters and police rescue workers
combed the rubble.
   Military and civilian officials are not expected to determine
the official cause of the accident for several days, said Vargas,
but nearly all speculation points to bad weather as the culprit, he
added.
   The Caracas area has been shrouded in heavy fog and rain the
last three days due to an unusual low pressure system over the
area, according to the Observatorio Cajigal, a local meteorological
station.

   WASHINGTON -- Venezuela approved two new aluminum smelter
projects -- Orinoco Holding and Aluyana -- involving about
$2.1 billion in investments and authorized $585 million of
debt-for-equity swaps to help finance both projects.
   The Venezuelan government is aggressively trying to
develop its aluminum production. Earlier this year, it
authorized debt-equity financing to help finance increased
production at two other projects.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Altogether, the four projects should increase aluminum
production to about 1.6 million metric tons annually by 1995
from a current level of about 630,000 tons, according to the
Venezuelan government.
   The $297 million in debt-for-equity financing for the
Orinoco project will be organized by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
the government said. The $288 million of debt-for-equity
financing in the Aluyana project will be organized by a unit
of BankAmerica Corp., it said.

his Venezuelan counterpart Rafael Caldera created a high-level 
binational commission that will be subdivided into various work 
groups to deal with the following issues: 
  -- Conclude the pavement of the BR 174 highway, and expand 
the agreement on land transportation. Brazil will pave 200 km 
of the highway linking Boa Vista with Santa Elena de Uairen. 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Venezuela could 
cooperate by supplying the asphalt. 
  -- The electric sector: Brazil will purchase energy from 
Venezuela and will build the transmission lines. Interim Mines 
and Energy Minister Jose Israel Vargas said the idea is to get 
electricity for Manaus from the Guri electric plant. He also 
said discussions are being held for an exchange between Guri and 
the Balbina hydroelectric plant, because the two countries have 
weather problems. 
  -- The hydrographic sector: study the possibility of 
navigation between the Orinoco and Amazon river basins. 
President Franco said during a news conference that he 
discussed with President Caldera the interconnection of the 
Orinoco and Amazon river basins, which have an extension of 
approximately 11,000 km. The studies began in 1943. Franco 
said that what the two governments have in mind is to continue 
the studies with the objective of "reaching the River Plate 
basin." 
  -- The mineral sector: The two governments will study the 
possibility of carrying out compatible joint projects regarding 
sustainable development and the protection of the indigenous 
communities. The cooperation agreement signed in 1991 between 
the Rio Doce Valley Company (CVRD) and the Venezuelan 
Corporation of Guayana (CVG) will be useful for the development 
of such projects. Israel Vargas commented that the two countries 
are studying the possibility of using manganese from Carajas in 
Venezuelan electric furnaces. The objective is to produce iron 
alloys for the Venezuelan steel industry. He also reported that 
studies are being made for joint gold prospecting, to develop 
the border regions and employ gold prospectors in legal and 
orderly activities. 
  -- The environmental sector: joint development of ecological 
tourism, scientific research on biodiversity, and cooperation 
for recovering the deteriorated areas caused by illegal mining. 
The illegal activities in the border regions were mentioned in 
the joint communique signed by the two presidents. It says: 
"The presidents agreed on the need to fight any illegal 
activities on their common border with determination. With that 
objective they commit themselves to the reinforcement of 
appropriate measures for the eradication of illegal mineral 
prospecting in the border zones, and to carry out an effective 
control over the use of equipment and other components used in 
prospecting that contribute to the depredation and contamination 
of the environment." 
  Bolivar State Governor Andres Velasco of the Radical Cause, 
a 
leftist party that came out third in last year's presidential 
elections, said: "The Brazilian Government must reverse its 
position regarding the gold prospectors." He also said the gold 
prospectors are involved in drug trafficking. He added: "It is 
possible they are also being used by the multinationals as 
spearheads for mineral prospecting." 
  -- The Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System] project: 
The Venezuelan Government is studying Brazilian participation 
in carrying out ecological-economic zoning. 
  -- The hemispheric summit: The two presidents expressed 
their hopes for the upcoming summit, to be held in the United 
States this year. The two countries will make joint efforts to 
have the agenda reflect an effective hemispheric consensus. 
  -- Economic complementation agreement: The two governments 
will expedite negotiations for reaching an agreement within the 
framework of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). 
"Such an agreement could also include, in addition to the 
reduction of trade barriers, incentive measures for border 
trade, for promoting investment protection, for facilitating the 
trade of services, for protecting intellectual property, and 
regulations for preventing unfair competition and access to 
public biddings."

<HL> World Oil Reserves Rose 27% in Year As Producer Nations Boosted Estimates </HL>

   The world oil glut has suddenly got bigger, postponing the day of any severe shortages into the next century. 

   Based on authoritative new estimates, proved international oil reserves increased spectacularly within the past year -- as much as 190 billion barrels, or 27%, despite the drilling downturn. 
That's enough new oil to satisfy global needs for an additional nine years, based on current use of 20 billion barrels annually. 

   Such a surge makes it "difficult to argue that running out of oil should be mankind's principal concern," says Barry C. Good, an oil analyst who is a managing director of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 

   But even though the supply increases puncture the widely held theory that the world is using up oil reserves faster than they are being replaced, not all oil countries share in the petroleum bonanza. 
Most notably in the U.S., still the world's biggest oil consumer, reserves and production have dropped since the oil-price collapse of two years ago. 
This underscores the worsening regional imbalance of oil supplies and further solidifies the hold that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to have on oil markets. 
Most of the reserves gains were recorded in six of the 13 countries that make up OPEC, chiefly the Middle East members and Venezuela. 

   "It's not the quantity of oil out there that is the problem -- it's the distribution," says Charles D. Masters, chief of the world energy resources program of the U.S. Geological Survey. 

   Mr. Masters and some of his associates were among the early dissenters from the consensus that world oil reserves had remained flat at around 700 billion barrels since 1984. 
A study they presented at last April's World Petroleum Congress in Houston concluded that proved oil reserves should be revised upward to 795 billion barrels. 

   Recently, publications of record for world oil reserves also have begun raising their estimates. 
Houston-based World Oil expects in August to raise its 1987 world reserve estimates 5% above the 1986 estimate of 716.94 billion barrels. 
The London-based Petroleum Economist recently estimated that world reserves, excluding the Communist countries, totaled 774.2 billion barrels for year-end 1986. 
That was up 100 billion barrels from the Economist's year-earlier estimate. 
OPEC accounted for the gains. 

   Now, the Oil &amp; Gas Journal, an industry publication whose world-wide figures are closely watched by oil companies and producer governments, places total reserves at the beginning of this year at 887.35 billion barrels. 
That's a record 190-billion-barrel leap from the 697.45 billion barrels estimated at Jan. 1, 1987. 

   Annually, this Tulsa, Okla. publication surveys the producing nations and then bases its assessment of world reserves on official reports. 
Editors say they confirm the government data with a variety of other sources, including oil companies operating in the countries and, if possible, with geologists familiar with individual fields. 

   Although leading geologists endorse these higher reserve statistics, differences of opinion exist as to how much oil can be economically recovered from known fields. 
Politics further complicates the estimating problem. 
Proved reserves generally are defined as those that can be economically produced with current technology at today's prices. 
So when prices dropped and drilling slumped from the 1986 oil crash, it was commonly assumed reserves would fall, too. 

   The sharply higher reserve estimates now being circulated don't, in fact, reflect much newly discovered oil. 
Few big new oil fields are being found -- even in OPEC. 
The increases are due mainly to recent official revisions by producing countries. 

   "Increases of this magnitude cannot be the result of new discoveries in a period of productive capacity surpluses, unstable crude oil prices and depressed drilling," says the Oil &amp; Gas Journal. 
"Instead, they reflect new estimates of the fruits of past exploratory efforts, based on revisions by the countries themselves or on information not previously available." 

   Venezuela led the way in increasing its reserve estimates in late 1986, doubling its projection to more than 56 billion barrels. 
The revision included not only new finds but also incorporated some Orinoco heavy oil-crudes so dense they are difficult to transport and refine. 

   Five other OPEC members around the Persian Gulf, including warring Iraq and Iran, have raised their official reserves data. 
Abu Dhabi, for example, tripled its estimate to 92.2 billion barrels, nearly four times the 25.26 billion barrels estimated for the U.S. 

   Industry publications of record initially were skeptical of some of the new claims, knowing that Mexico, for instance, had once pumped up its reserves officially to increase bank borrowings. 
Only now, a year later, has the Oil &amp; Gas Journal finally recognized Venezuela's higher figures. 
But one editor says he still has trouble with Iran's doubling to 92.85 billion barrels, even though the government's letter certifying the new figures "came from the highest authority -- in the name of God." 

   Still, except possibly for Iran, there is evidence to support the government revisions. 
Indeed, it's suspected that some Persian Gulf OPEC members still may be understating their reserves, especially Saudi Arabia. 
Officially, the kingdom's reserves have remained slightly under 167 billion barrels, 19% of the world total, for several years. 
Industry officials suggest a figure twice as large.

<F P=106> [From the "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Brazilian President Itamar Franco and Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera agreed, during a meeting held at La 
Guzmania presidential residence, to increase bilateral 
cooperation and fully use consultation and political dialogue 
mechanisms. 
  The two presidents decided to create a high-level binational 
commission that will be chaired by their foreign ministers and 
comprised of the ministers in charge of bilateral cooperation 
issues. The presidents also agreed to hold the second meeting 
of the Venezuela-Brazil political consultation mechanism in our 
country. Furthermore, they issued instructions to authorities 
in the foreign trade sector to assess and step up the 
negotiations to reach an economic complementation agreement 
within the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] 
framework. 
  Even though no agreements were signed in the meeting, it 
helped establish the groundwork for common projects in different 
sectors. In the highway sector they agreed to finish highway 
BR-174 and to broaden a land transportation agreement. In the 
electric sector they reached an agreement for the purchase of 
Venezuelan energy. In the hydrographic sector the topic was 
navigability between the Orinoco and Amazon Rivers. In the 
mining sector they will work jointly to protect Indians at the 
border area. In the ecology sector the issue was ecological 
tourism in a joint action to recover areas degraded by illegal 
miners. In the steel works sector the SIDOR [Orinoco Iron and 
Steel Works] furnaces will manufacture iron and manganese alloys. 
  Later, during a news conference, the Brazilian president 
said 
his government is carefully analyzing border problems with our 
country, adding that neither Venezuela nor Brazil should neglect 
looking into these issues because they might cause an atmosphere 
of uncertainty in the relations between the two nations. 
Moreover, President Rafael Caldera said that following the 
talks with his counterpart he is fully convinced the current 
Brazilian Government is clearly inclined to adopt the necessary 
measures to prevent illegal mining on Venezuelan territory. 
  [Begin recording] [Franco, in Portuguese] It is clear that 
the border problem between Brazil and Venezuela will be 
carefully analyzed. We have a very extensive border with 
Venezuela, a border that was abandoned by our peoples. Now with 
the presence of President Rafael Caldera and with the presence 
of the Brazilian Government, we will be able to study and 
carefully analyze those aspects which today cause problems in 
our relations. 
  [Caldera] I am fully convinced that the current Brazilian 
Government is clearly inclined to adopt all the measures 
possible to prevent the garimpeiros' [Brazilian gold seekers] 
illegal mining activities in Venezuela -- both by watching the 
border and by adopting precautionary measures in the State of 
Roraima and other border states where they may have their 
operations centers and by enforcing legal measures through 
Brazilian courts against those who have perpetrated illegal 
actions in this area. [end recording] 
  Referring to the first meeting held between the heads of 
state of Venezuela and Brazil, Gilberto [as heard] Poletto, 
minister of state and president of the Foreign Trade Institute, 
and Andres Velasquez, governor of Bolivar State, agreed that new 
roads have been opened to strengthen bilateral relations. 
  [Begin recording] [Poletto] There was talk about stepping up 
the negotiations to sign an economic cooperation agreement 
between Venezuela and Brazil because this had been discussed a 
couple of years ago. This will bolster the partial agreement we 
currently have, perhaps by adding more products and including 
some additional norms. The goal is to consolidate and improve 
trade relations between Venezuela and Brazil, which have 
recently increased but are still insufficient compared with the 
immense possibilities we have in different trade sectors. 
  [Velasquez] Specifically referring to the Brazilians' case, 
I have had the opportunity to discuss a specific proposal. All 
the agreements that the Venezuelan Government has to establish 
with the Brazilian Government should include a specific 
agreement with the Roraima State Government, because we believe 
Roraima State has become an excellent supply center, or 
logistics support center, for illegal miners, meaning the 
garimpeiros. In addition, this has to be discussed at length 
because the latest information we have, based on investigations 
that have been conducted, is that the garimpeiros are not just 
involved in illegal gold mining activities. They also act as 
scouts and guard beachheads for drug trafficking activities, and 
the illegal landing strips built by them are later used for drug 
trafficking. [end recording]

FT  15 DEC 94 / National Power plans fuel switch: Plant would burn
controversial Orimulsion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, the electricity generation company, is to apply for
government permission to build equipment which will enable it to burn
Orimulsion, the controversial bitumen-based fuel, at its Pembroke plant in
west Wales.
The company's application, expected to be lodged within weeks, is a blow to
providers of other fuels including coal and gas. Burning Orimulsion at
Pembroke could displace up to 5m tonnes of coal a year.
National Power is already discussing with the pollution inspectorate its
plans to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment at Pembroke to allow it to
generate electricity there.
The likely submission for section 36 (planning) approval by the government
to fit the equipment indicates the company is intent on going ahead.
'We are going ahead with the project because we believe it has the potential
to provide clean electricity at a significantly lower cost than competing
fuels for generation,' National Power said.
Before it could go ahead and burn Orimulsion, National Power would need
permission from both the pollution inspectorate and from the govern-ment.
National Power also believes there may be potential to burn Orimulsion at
other oil-fired power stations.
Orimulsion is the trade name of a natural bitumen dispersed in water. It is
produced in Venezuela from the Orinoco Belt by Bitor, a subsidiary of
Petroleos De Venezuela, a state-owned company.
Bitor Europe, which markets the fuel in Europe, hopes to sell Orimulsion
throughout the Continent - but believes the UK is among the strongest
potential markets.
The pollution inspectorate provoked a controversy last year when it gave
permission to PowerGen, another generator, to burn Orimulsion without
desulphurisation equipment at its power stations at Ince on Merseyside and
Richborough in Kent.
The use of Orimulsion is opposed by the coal lobby since it displaces
indigenous fuels, and by the environmental lobby which points to what it
says are high sulphur emissions from the fuel.
Bitor Europe says the fuel emits no more sulphur than some coals already
being used to generate electricity in the UK. In addition, it says
Orimulsion emits less carbon and nitrous oxide than coal.
Should National Power win regulatory and government approval to fit
desulphurisation equipment at Pembroke, the effect on coal would be
considerable. Coal burn for generation is forecast by some analysts to fall
below 30m tonnes in England and Wales by the end of the decade.
RJB Mining, the coal company taking over British Coal's English assets, has
however made generous provision for Orimulsion burn in its calculations. It
believes Orimulsion could displace 6.5m tonnes of coal in 1998-99 and 8.3m
tonnes in the following year.
PowerGen burns about 1m tonnes a year of Orimulsion at Ince and Richborough
and has no plans to increase this amount.

FT  17 NOV 94 / Venezuela opens its oil sector to private capital:
Exploration tenders sought for first time since nationalisation in 1976
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's national oil company has developed a programme to open its
exploration and production sectors to private capital for the first time
since the oil industry was nationalised in 1976.
Petroleos de Venezuela, PDVSA, plans to seek tenders on profit-sharing
contracts, under which private companies will be allowed to explore about 10
geographical areas onshore and offshore.
Successful companies must finance all exploration themselves. If commercial
quantities of crude oil or natural gas are discovered, the private investor
will then set up a joint venture with one of PDVSA's operating subsidiaries
 -Corpoven, Lagoven or Maraven - to develop the new fields and market the
oil internationally.
If no oil or gas is found in commercial quantities, the private party bears
the loss.
The PDVSA plan must still be approved by the cabinet of President Rafael
Caldera and by a joint session of the Venezuelan Congress. PDVSA officials
expect no big problems.
PDVSA, one of the world's largest oil companies, has extensive proven
reserves of heavy crude oil and bitumen, but wants to boost its reserves of
higher-value light and medium crudes to stay competitive internationally. At
end-1993, PDVSA's proven reserves of crude oil stood at 64.5bn barrels, the
largest in the western hemisphere.
Executives at PDVSA say geological and seismic studies indicate that the
country still has large, undiscovered deposits of light and medium crude
oils. Exploration of the most promising areas by PDVSA on its own would
require capital investments of Dollars 6bn-8bn, taking more than 25 years.
However, PDVSA expects that if private investors join the effort to find
oil, exploration of these same areas could be completed in 10 years, with
all exploration investment paid for by private companies.
The areas to be put up for tender could hold between 7bn and 23bn barrels of
light/medium crudes, plus 10,000bn cubic feet of gas, according to estimates
made by PDVSA after a British Petroleum survey.
Winning bidders will be chosen on the basis of how much of their future
after-tax profits they are willing to hand over to the state if they find
oil and gas. PDVSA says that according to risk contacts offered in other
countries, the state keeps between 71 and 88 per cent of after-tax earnings,
with the remainder going to private investors.
In developing its proposals, PDVSA has been mindful of the failure of this
year's round of oil and gas tenders in neighbouring Colombia. But while
international oil companies such as Exxon, Shell, BP, Amoco and others have
shown considerable interest in the Venezuelan plan, they have some
reservations.
For example, some would prefer a transparent mechanism that would reduce
their payments to the state to encourage them to develop profitably any
smaller, more remote fields. The government is working on a plan which would
offer possible post facto reductions in royalty payments in such cases.
Companies have also expressed concern about government policy, including
strict controls on foreign exchange transactions and the suspension of
constitutional rights to private property.
PDVSA and the government are working on possible solutions. PDVSA managers
point out, for example, that when investors are ready to repatriate profits,
probably in several years, exchange controls should have been lifted or
softened.
'Venezuela is without doubt one of the most attractive countries for risk
investment in exploration,' said the local representative of a US oil
company. 'If PDVSA can work out the kinks, they should receive a strong
response from bidders, and could obtain several billion dollars in
exploration and development capital over the next decade.'
Venezuela has been slowly opening up its nationalised oil industry for the
last few years. Under the previous government, private oil companies were
allowed to produce crude and natural gas under operating contracts in
so-called marginal (relatively small) oil fields. But in these cases, the
operator is paid on a per-barrel basis by PDVSA; the oil does not belong to
the private investor and must be turned over to PDVSA.
Several important joint ventures between PDVSA units and foreign companies
have been established in producing natural gas and upgrading heavy oil, but
none has begun to operate. Until now, exploration for and production of
crude oil (for eventual sale) had been off limits to private investors.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Ramon Meneses from Puerto Ayacucho] </F>
  [Text] DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] reports on the 
increasing use of Venezuela as a bridge for drugs have revealed 
that the "doors" also open to the south, specifically in the 
Amazon and Apure regions, a high-level police official has 
reported. 
  "This situation has been getting more serious every day. In 
past years, the drug barons, who were operating in neighboring 
Colombia, have transferred all their laboratories to areas in 
the Vichada and Guainia regions. It has been easy for them to 
work in those secluded areas because the presence of security 
forces is sparse there," Venezuelan intelligence officials have 
pointed out. 
  People know about the groups in Puerto Ayacucho but they 
move 
very cautiously due to the [words indistinct] with the movement 
of money and weapons. Many people have reported encountering 
drug traffickers when they are working in the Amazon region. 
Drug traffickers reportedly have opened roads in the Montana 
Fria, Rueda, and Garcitas areas, to the south of Puerto 
Ayacucho. They also reportedly opened another road in the 
northern area, very near Puerto Paez, to take advantage of 
Puerto Carreno and other Vichada towns. 
  A prominent National Guard official, who has been working 
against drug traffickers for several years, has reported: 
"People don't talk about them because they fear retributions, 
but seeing how the drug traffickers are increasing their ties in 
the region and apprehensive that their quiet existence in the 
Amazons may turn into violence like in Colombia, they are now 
cooperating and we have been informed of the drug traffickers' 
paths in the south." 
<H5>  The Road is Free on the Colombian Side </H5>
  Due to the freedom they have on the other side of the 
Orinoco 
[Colombia], Venezuelan authorities can do little about the 
presence of the drug traffickers on the Venezuelan side. The 
drug traffickers control entire towns in the neighboring country 
and authorities do not get close, sometimes due to fear and at 
other times due to compliance with the illegal activity. "Things 
are so serious that on one occasion we arrested a Colombian 
citizen who had a large amount of drugs on him in Puerto 
Ayacucho and we were surprised to find out that he was the top 
police official in a town close to the Amazon capital city. How 
can you fight this?" the official asked. 
  The Orinoco is a long fluvial highway, through which 
Venezuelan authorities, by an agreement signed with Colombian 
authorities, are able to transit freely. They did not consider 
that international right today would cause a serious problem on 
that bordering and depressed region where drug traffickers have 
set up their headquarters and where they secure allies in all 
the sectors of the, up until now respectable, community. 
  Enrique Betancourt, one of only two native governors that 
region has had in all its history, and one of the few strugglers

  [Text] DEA reports on the increasing use of Venezuela as a 
bridge for drugs have also revealed that the "doors" open to the 
south, specifically in the Amazon and Apure regions, a 
high-level police official has reported. 
  "This situation has been getting more serious every day. 
During the past years, the drug barons, who were operating in 
neighboring Colombia, have transferred all their laboratories to 
areas in Vichada and Guainia regions. It has been easy for them 
to work in those secluded areas because the presence of security 
forces is sparse there," Venezuelan intelligence officials have 
pointed out. 
  People know about the groups in Puerto Ayacucho but they 
move 
very cautiously due to the [words indistinct] with the movement 
of money and weapons. Many people have reported encountering 
drug traffickers when they are working in the Amazon region. 
Drug traffickers reportedly have opened roads in the Montana 
Fria, Rueda, and Garcitas areas, to the south of Puerto 
Ayacucho. They also reportedly opened another road in the 
northern area, very near Puerto Paez, to take advantage of 
Puerto Carreno and other Vichada towns. 
  A prominent National Guard official, who has been working 
against drug traffickers for several years, has reported: 
"People don't talk about them because they fear retributions, 
but seeing how the drug traffickers are increasing their ties in 
the region and apprehensive that their quiet existence in the 
Amazons may turn into violence like in Colombia, they are now 
cooperating and we have been informed of the drug traffickers' 
paths in the south." 
<H5>  The Road is Free on the Colombian Side </H5>
  Due to the freedom they have on the other side of the 
Orinoco 
[Colombia], Venezuelan authorities can do little about the 
presence of the drug traffickers in the Venezuelan side. The 
drug traffickers control entire towns in the neighboring country 
and authorities do not get close, sometimes due to fear and 
others due to compliance with the illegal activity. "Things are 
so serious that on one occasion we arrested a Colombian citizen 
who had a large amount of drugs on him in Puerto Ayacucho and we 
were surprised to find out that he was the top police official 
in a town close to the Amazon capital city. How can you fight 
against this?" the official asked. 
  The Orinoco is a long fluvial highway, through which 
Venezuelan authorities, by an agreement signed with Colombian 
authorities, are able to transit freely. They did not consider 
that international right today would cause a serious problem on 
that bordering and depressed region where drug traffickers have 
set up their headquarters and where they secure allies in all 
the sectors of the, up until now respectable, community. 
  Enrique Betancourt, one of only two native governors that 
region has had in all its history, and one of the few strugglers 
against that scourge said: "When I was governor I ordered 
measures against all the drug traffickers' fronts, because I 
knew that it [drugs] was filtering through the weak and scarcely 
guarded border. Unfortunately my administration was short-lived. 
However, during those months not one act of violence took place 
in the state and not one case of kidnaping was reported, as is 
happening today, he noted. This scourge has been spreading its 
evil on several fronts of our community, from which officials of 
the security corps and officials of the governorship do not 
escape."

incidents linked to drug trafficking if a stiff and courageous 
response does not exist by those in charge of enforcing the law.

lords based on false promises and positions from which they 
manipulate and operate under their superiors' complacent gaze;

progress - Venezuela
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS in Venezuela have been talking for years about the country's
mining potential but have achieved few concrete results.
However, the administration of President Carlos Andres Perez, elected for a
five-year term in early 1989, is now making tangible progress. In 1990, the
Perez government broadly liberalised rules on foreign investment. Last year
it reduced the maximum corporate tax rate to 30 per cent, an important
advance for potential investors, since most mining activities previously
were taxed at around 60 per cent of operating profits.
These measures, with other reforms that are turning Venezuela into a more
open and competitive economy, have helped to make mining more attractive to
private investors.
In spite of these advances, the overall figures on Venezuelan mining in 1991
were not very encouraging. The Central Bank reported that mining, which grew
by 5.3 per cent in 1990, declined by 3.6 per cent last year even as the
economy expanded vigorously.
The 1991 results were due principally to a sharp decline in gold and diamond
production. A closer look, however, shows that some important advances are
being made, especially in coal and bauxite, while new gold investments are
under way. COAL: Output at Venezuela's largest coal mine, located in the
Guasare coal fields of the western state of Zulia, reached 1.2m tonnes
during the first half of 1992, close to the total of approximately 1.5m
tonnes for full-year 1991.
Carbones del Guasare, the joint venture company that operates the open pit
mine in Guasare, plans to reach total production of 3m tonnes this year. Its
two partners, Carbozulia (wholly owned by the Venezuelan national oil
company, PDVSA, and Agipcoal), are expected to decide later this year on
whether they will invest in a rail and port infrastructure to help raise
production to 20m tonnes per year by the end of the decade.
Cavoven, a joint venture of Venezolana de Cementos, a private company, and
Mitsubishi, produced more than 241,000 tonnes of coal in 1991 from its Fila
Maestra mine in eastern Venezuela. It plans to reach 300,000 tonnes this
year.
Other coal production, totalling less than 500,000 tonnes last year, came
from mines - some of which produce coking coal - in the western state of
Tachira. Coal exports in 1991 were 1.85m tonnes, up 122,000 tonnes - or 7
per cent - from 1990. Exports came from Guasare and Cavoven.
Most of Venezuela's coal is exported. The largest markets, in descending
order, are the EC, Scandinavia, the US and the Caribbean. Apart from
Agipcoal, which is considering a large investment to expand output at the
Paso Diablo mine, other international companies are studying new investments
at other sites in the Guasare fields, which have proven reserves of 353m
tonnes and identified reserves of over 2bn tonnes.
These companies include Shell Coal and Veba Oel, which last year completed
geotechnical and hydrological studies at the Socuy mine site; AT Massey Coal
and Cavoven, which explored the Mina Norte site; and Cyprus Coal which is
exploring the Cachiri site with Carbozulia.
BAUXITE: After years of delays, the government is also making progress in
increasing production at its bauxite mine in Los Pijiguaos, among the
jungles of southeastern Venezuela. Bauxiven, which runs the mine, produced
1.94m tonnes of bauxite in 1991, up sharply from 1990's total of 771,000
tonnes.
The company made a slow start this year, producing only 270,000 tonnes
between January and June. But officials say that production was down due to
the installation of new equipment designed to raise the mine's capacity to
3.5m tonnes a year and higher. Bauxiven is still shooting for a production
target of 3-3.5m tonnes for full-year 1992.
GOLD: Production of gold and diamonds (the latter are often found in
deposits of alluvial gold) declined sharply last year due mainly to a
contraction in the number of individual miners working sites in the
southeast state of Bolivar. The rich alluvial and underground gold deposits
in Bolivar are worked chiefly by thousands of free-lance miners, many of
them - like the 'garimpeiros' from Brazil - working in Venezuela illegally.
Gold is also mined by a variety of companies, including government-owned
Minerven, which produced two tonnes of gold in 1991 and 784 kilograms during
the first half of this year. Accurate production figures are not available
due to the large number of illegal miners. Private sector sources estimate
last year's total gold output at 11-12 tonnes, down from estimates in
previous years of around 20 tonnes. (The government said that production in
1988 may have reached 27 tonnes, but other sources consider this quite
high.)
Monarch Resources, a Bermuda-based company, is currently developing the
largest gold mining project in Venezuela. Monarch, which has been operating
in Venezuela since 1987, is investing Dollars 23m to develop a new mine - La
Camorra - in Bolivar state. It began developing the mine in June of this
year. Monarch also has 10 geologists and a support staff of 75 exploring
additional prospects, and is investing Dollars 3m on exploration this year
alone.
The company also operates a tailings mill (Revemin) which last year produced
800 kg of gold. Monarch, with a total payroll of 300 in Venezuela, has
invested around Dollars 40m in the country thus far. It reported a loss of
Dollars 2.9m in 1991. In addition, Canada's Placer Dome is exploring in
Bolivar state and is studying the possibility of a plant to process
tailings. Greenwich Resources also has a small gold operation in Bolivar.
IRON ORE: Iron ore, which is mined and marketed by the state-owned
Ferrominera del Orinoco, has been a staple export product for Venezuela for
decades. Ferrominera in 1975 took over mining operations formerly owned by
US Steel and Bethlehem Steel when the government decided to nationalise the
iron ore sector. However, the present government is studying the
privatisation of an iron ore pellet plant it owns and wants international
investors to build plants to produce pre-reduced iron-ore briquettes for
export.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15 
March. 
  Orinoco Iron and Steel Works, Sidor, and Colombian Steel 
Works Corporation, Acesco, signed an agreement allowing Sidor to 
open an office in Bogota. According to Sidor, Colombia is one of 
the corporation's main sheet metal customers, and "having an 
office in Bogota will allow Sidor to compete with similar 
suppliers from Japan and Brazil." Company officials reported 
that "this agreement is part of the overall economic integration 
process." (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 10 Mar 94 p E11) 
  Overall exports dropped 53.2 percent in January compared 
with 
January 1993. The Central Statistics and Data Processing Office, 
OCEI, reports that exports totalled $414 million. Meanwhile, 
imports fell 43.3 percent for the same period. Experts said 
"Venezuela's 1993 economic situation was the worst in recent 
years." Inflation closed at 50 percent for the year, the bolivar 
was devaluated 35 percent, and the deficit hit 3 percent of the 
GNP. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 0006 GMT 10 Mar 94) 
  Nontraditional exports to the United States increased 27.6 
percent during 1993 while imports fell 8 percent. The Foreign 
Trade Institute (ICE) and OCEI reported that the United States 
purchased products worth $746.3 million in 1993, which is 23.1 
percent of total Venezuelan nontraditional exports. Imports from 
the United States dropped about $444.3 million, although such 
transactions totalled 12.13 percent of Venezuelan exports in 
general. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 
15] 
  Fedecamaras, Venezuelan Federation of Associations and 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, has issued its monthly 
inflation report. The study shows that inflation dropped in 
February to 1.9 percent, a 55.8 percent decrease from January 
1994 and 26.9 percent less than February 1993. The main 
contributors were home expenditures, clothing, and food and 
drink. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 12 Mar 94 p E10) 
  Following congressional approval of the Emergency Banking 
Law, the finance commission approved the Public Credit Bill, 
which will fund the former. Acting Finance Minister Luis 
Grisanti said the bill "will not have inflationary effects and 
will not force the Central Bank of Venezuela to print money 
without appropriate reserve funds." He stressed the need to 
restore financial equilibrium, as "solving the financial 
difficulties of several Venezuelan banks is closely related to 
the process of restoring trust." He added that "this will in 
fact bring down inflation, reduce the exchange rate, and cut 
interest rates." (Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in 
Spanish 0000 GMT 13 Mar 94) 
  Nonpetroleum product exports to Andean countries increased 
in 
the last five years from $190 million to $862 million. ICE said 
"this figure is unprecedented in the trade relations among the 
region's countries." Sales to the Andean countries totaled 10.5 
percent of Venezuela's total exports in 1988 and rose to 26.3 
percent in 1993. The main items exported to the region are 
aluminum, urea, cane sugar, polyesters, coal, antibiotics, and 
other medicines. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2241 GMT 14 Mar 94)

  [Excerpt] The two major projects to modernize and expand 
the production capacity of the Amuay and Cardon refineries, 
which will make it possible to increase production of 
reformulated gasoline by 100,000 barrels per day, call for 
investment of 130 billion bolivars this year, according to a 
PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] report which includes 
additional information about other aspects of this industry in 
Venezuela. 
  The report says: "The dynamics of the market for 
hydrocarbons, the new environmental regulations of the 
industrialized countries, and the premise that we will continue 
to be a top oil-producing country lead PDVSA to continue to plan 
considerable investments in the medium and long term to upgrade 
its national refineries in order to adapt the variety of refined 
products Venezuela sells to the changing demands of the world 
market." 
  In most industrialized countries, the governments have 
established deadlines for compliance with environmental 
protection standards without reducing gasoline octane ratings. 
In view of these standards, PDVSA's operating subsidiaries are 
carrying out an investment plan to ensure the quality required 
on our markets. Among their projects are the El Palito 
oxigenates plant, which came into operation in 1993, and the 
plant that is being built in Cardon. These plants will permit 
exports of reformulated gasoline to the United States beginning 
in 1995. 
  The investments, which are around 130 billion bolivars in 
Venezuela in 1994, are focused mainly on the Cardon Upgrading 
Project (PARC) and the Amuay Delayed Coker (CRAY). These 
projects will contribute to increasing the processing capacity 
for heavy crudes in Venezuela's current refineries by 100,000 
barrels per day by 1995, while at the same time reducing 
residual fuel production by about 25,000 barrels per day in 
comparison with 1994 production. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 19 
April. 
  A study by oil specialist Leonardo Montiel Ortega indicates 
Venezuelan refineries overseas, far from being profit makers, 
produce net losses of more than $96.3 million. These losses are 
due to the $.86 price differential at which Venezuela sells its 
crude to the refinery Citgo in the United States. Venezuela 
dispatched to that refinery 305,000 barrels during 1993, at an 
average price of $13.01 a barrel, while the average price for 
Venezuelan crude was $13.87. In addition, this refinery does not 
process heavy oils, resulting in diminished Venezuelan sale 
possibilities. Montiel recommends these loss makers be sold. 
(Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 11 April 1994 p 1-21] 
  Mexico is backing Venezuela' efforts to get the 
Brussels-based Customs Affairs Council to accept its Oremulsion 
as a bituminous oil and thus avoid tariff difficulties in world 
markets. Venezuela has no vote or veto power in the council and 
has enlisted Mexico's assistance. Venezuelan Petroleum President 
Luis Giusti estimates Venezuelan oil will fetch $10.50 a barrel, 
but he did not rule out the possibility of reaching $11.50, the 
budgeted amount for 1994. A recent decision by the European 
Union Nomenclature Committee classified Oremulsion as a bitumen 
(Code 2714), which increases the possibility of placing greater 
volumes of oil on the world market. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in 
Spanish 14 April 94 E-8) 
  The Council of Ministers approved an initiative on 13 April 
to raise urban minimum wages to 15,000 bolivares, 12,500 
bolivares in rural areas. Observers believe, considering the 
state of the Venezuelan economy and the constant protests by the 
public and private sector, this increase in the minimum wage 
will be well received. An important aspect of this decree, which 
was not disclosed to the media because certain adjustments were 
still pending at the time of approval, is that only 30 percent 
of the increase will be used as a base rate to estimate 
contributions to social security, a possibility already 
anticipated in Articles 138 and 171 of the Labor Code. (Caracas

   A South Carolina newsprint manufacturer
is planning a joint venture with a Canadian company to build and
manage a $350 million newsprint plant in northeast Venezuela,
officials say.
   Bowater Inc., whose pulp and paper group is headquartered in
Greenville, is working on an agreement with Abitibi-Price Corp. of
Toronto that should be completed this month.
   Bowater and Abitibi-Price each will control 24.25 percent of the
plant, and the Venezuelan government will control the rest, said
Bowater spokesman Arthur King.
   ``This is a project that the Venezuelan government has been
looking at for years,'' King said. ``By making newsprint there,
they can take the wood and power that they have in profusion and
are currently not using, and turn it into another export product _
something besides oil _ which they need desperately for foreign
exchange in Venezuela.''
   The new plant will be in Ciudad Guyana, on the Orinoco River in
northeast Venezuela, which is surrounded by acres of Caribbean
pine, and close to Guri Dam, one of the world's largest generators
of hydroelectric power.
   Plaza said after the one-machine mill begins operating sometime
in 1992, it will produce about 200,000 tons of newsprint per year
and employ about 350 people.
   All but about 40,000 tons of the newsprint will be exported to
customers worldwide, Plaza said, and though Bowater's share will be
nominal, it is expected to significantly boost the company's
exports, which have fallen off in recent years.
   ``They used to be a fairly good-sized exporter, but more
recently they've downsized their export exposure,'' said Mark
Diverio, a pulp and paper analyst who follows Bowater for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The biggest reason for the drop in exports was the 1984 sale of
Bowater Newfoundland Ltd., a wholly owned plant in Canada that
produced much of the company's newsprint for export, Diverio said.

^Venezuela Orders Additional Oil on Market</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela ordered the state-owned oil
monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) to start placing extra
petroleum on the market, company president Arturo Sosa Pietri said
Thursday.
   He said PDVSA was ordered Wednesday afternoon by the government
to begin selling additional oil above the country's OPEC quota of
1.94 million barrels per day.
   At a ceremony to celebrate the oil monopoly's 15th anniversary,
he also hinted that Venezuela's oil supply should be considered as
an energy alternative to oil from the Middle East.
   ``Industrialized nations will not tolerate again a growing
dependence on Middle East oil,'' he said.
   Also Thursday, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez called
for foreign investment in Venezuelan oil, and said he would call a
congressional session to review nationalization laws that keep oil
firmly under government control.
   ``We must think of the capacity of foreign and domestic capital
to expand these petroleum industries, especially in petrochemicals
and oil refining,'' Perez said in a speech.
   The order to sell more petroleum coincided with a decision by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to place more oil
on the market to offset the loss caused by the embargo against oil
from Iraq and Kuwait. About 4 million barrels per day were lost
after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Sosa Pietri told The Associated Press that Brazil and Spain will
each receive 50,000 barrels per day of Venezuela's additional
crude, while India would receive 10,000 barrels per day and the
United States would receive 200,000 barrels.
   Industry analysts estimate Venezuela is now producing 100,000 to
150,000 barrels above its quota. Authorities have said the country
plans to sell up to 500,000 barrels above its quota by the end of
the year.
   In an address, he said the company plans to export nearly 2.5
million barrels per day by 1993. That would bring Venezuela oil
income to $15 billion per year, up from $11 billion estimated for
this year.
   ``The ongoing situation ... affirms Venezuela as a sure and
trustworthy oil supplier for industrial nations,'' he said in a
speech that presented Venezuela as a possible energy alternative to
Middle East oil.
   ``Our clients will prefer our crudes or our refined products
despite the fact that our oil is of a quality inferior to that of
the Middle East,'' he said.

   The Kruegers of Michigan, having
paddled their own canoes through Arctic ice and past Amazon
alligators, pushed off Monday on the homestretch of their
21,000-mile journey to the tip of South America.
   Verlen Krueger, 66, and his wife Valerie, 37, began their
``two-continent canoe expedition'' on June 8, 1986, about 200 miles
north of the Arctic Circle and hope to finish in February at Punta
Arenas, Chile.
   ``I've always had this in me, wanting to be an explorer like
Christopher Columbus or Daniel Boone,'' said Verlen Krueger, a
former farmer and plumber who built the two 17-foot canoes in his
garage at Lansing.
   Michigan is paying some expenses of the 2{-year trip as part of
the celebration of its 150th birthday. The Kruegers agreed to
collect rain and river water for research by two chemical
companies, and another company provided freeze-dried food.
   The two have paddled the icy waters of Canada's MacKenzie River
and through the Great Lakes, ridden the currents of the Maumee,
Wabash and Tennessee rivers and coasted down the Tom Bigbee
Waterway into the Gulf of Mexico at Mobile, Ala.
   ``There were no precedents for us at all,'' said Krueger, who
has covered much of the United States on canoe trips.
   He and his wife rigged their two canoes into a catamaran and
paddled 2,300 miles across the Caribbean, island-hopping from the
Bahamas to the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the West Indies.
They entered South America in Venezuela's Orinoco River.
   In the Bahamas, the canoes were surrounded by 3-foot-long
iguanas, fierce-looking but harmless.
   Alligators and howler monkeys abounded in the Amazon. ``We saw
hundreds of alligators,'' Verlen said. ``They have a disconcerting
way of entering the water to get away and it looks like they are
coming right at you.''
   The Kruegers said they do not speak Spanish but managed to get
along by using a dictionary, hand signals and ``smiling a lot.''
   One high navy official in Venezuela issued an order ``that if
anyone should see us, they should take care of us and feed us,''
said Valerie Krueger, a former technical assistant to a geologist.
   ``Our secret is that with a woman and a man with a gray beard,
nobody feels threatened by us,'' she said. As for illnesses, ``We
don't have time to get sick,'' she said, and added: ``The only
thing that really became a problem other than our sanity and legs
was that our soap bars kept falling overboard.''
   During a brief portage in Brazil between the Orinoco and an
Amazon tributary, an army captain was so impressed by the voyage
that he played them a tune on an instrument resembling a ukelele.
   They had to paddle 200 miles upstream on the Paraguay River in
Brazil because high winds had blown water plants into a solid mass
that blocked their path, and later spent 17 days without touching
shore on the same river because of floods.
   From the Arctic Circle to Asuncion they logged more than 17,000
miles, leaving about 4,000 miles to go around Cape Horn to Punta
Arenas. It was sunny, but chilly, on Monday when about 100
well-wishers saw them off.
   Their planned route is down the Paraguay, south on the Parana to
Buenos Aires, then down Argentina's Atlantic Coast to the Straits
of Magellan and around the cape to Punta Arenas.

In "Orinoco!" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre, Mexican playwright Emilio 
Carballido strands showgirls Fifi and Mina on a deserted boat careening down 
the Orinoco River, and sets them to thinking about where they are going, 
whether they will ever get there -- and if they really want to. 
</P>
<P>
This constant wondering recalls Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" (now 
playing at the Old Globe Theatre), in which the characters use their wait to 
question the nature of reality and their role in it. 
</P>
<P>
Like "Godot," "Orinoco!" is more than the story of its characters. It questions 
the future of Latin America itself. Where is it headed? Has the pilot 
figuratively left the ship, as he literally has in "Orinoco!"? Can this 
struggling part of the world, like these down-on-their-luck performers, take 
control of its own destiny? 
</P>
<P>
As such, "Orinoco!" is a thoughtful addition to the bilingual Latino play 
series that the Rep started with "I Don't Have to Show You No Stinkin' Badges" 
two years ago and "Burning Patience" last year. ("Orinoco!" will be presented 
in Spanish on July 19, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 29). 
</P>
<P>
But, despite its humor, spunk and richness of philosophical allusion, it is by 
far the least dramatic of the three. The pleasures of this two-woman play come 
in fits and starts, and director Jorge Huerta never quite coaxes the parts into 
a rhythm that flows. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some of the moments are well worth waiting for. There is an anecdote 
about flax blossoms, for example, that seems a poetic crystallization of the 
eternal dialogue between the two halves of human nature -- the one that sees 
the darkness foreshadowed in our final end, and the one that sees through the 
veil of our end, the light of our beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
Fifi, the showgirl who believes in the indomitability of life, tells the story 
of the blossoms, which fight against despair when the scissors cut them down by 
saying, "The best is yet to come." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the flax is woven into cloth that again seems doomed by the 
scissors ("Just like life," Mina says dolefully), and then finds itself 
transformed into beautiful linen shirts, then paper, then sparks that fly to 
the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge of two-person plays lies in whether the differences between the 
two spark change or simply cancel each other out. 
</P>
<P>
As touching as Ivonne Coll often is as the mournful Mina, she does not bring 
enough life to a role whose whole purpose seems to be to throw cold water on 
Fifi's dreams. The tempo sags to a stop when Jeannette Mirabal, as the brightly 
festooned Fifi, dashes off stage to check on a prospective lover or the 
temperature of the waiting champagne. 
</P>
<P>
What we see when Fifi leaves is a burned-out Mina just about to sputter out. 
What is missing are the glowing coals of Mina's former fire that Fifi is trying 
to fan into a flame again. 
</P>
<P>
D. Martyn Bookwalter's set, a curving ship, looks better than it plays. The 
women don't seem to have room to do much more than steer the wheel or dance on 
deck. It should be interesting to see how the set works when it's used again 
for "Thin Air," the world premiere of the Lynne Alvarez play that moves into 
the same design and space Aug. 8-27. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Nordyke's spare lighting fails to suggest the colors of the brilliant 
natural beauty that brings such joy to the women as they describe the sunrise. 
The resulting starkness of the surroundings sadly parallels the starkness of 
the drama on stage. Pretty as the sparks in "Orinoco!" are, they just don't add 
up to a fire.

<F P=106> [Article by Adela Leal] </F>
  [Text] The failure of shareholders to make the capital 
investments required to undertake new projects and expand 
others, and the management's inability to make the necessary 
corrections to adapt to new market conditions are the main 
causes of the deep crisis that has the basic enterprises in the 
Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana (CVG) holding company on the 
verge of collapse. 
  This assessment can be deduced from the report by an ad hoc 
congressional committee that looked into the financial 
statements of the enterprises from 1987 to 1992. The committee 
was chaired by Deputy Ramon Jose Medina, who was accompanied by 
Abdon Vivas Teran (the current minister president of the FIV 
[Venezuelan Investment Fund]), Gustavo Marquez, Freddy Lepage, 
Rafael Rodriguez Acosta, Amarilis Valor, Ildemaro Martinez, and 
Margot Siso. 
  The study, which focused on the aluminum and iron and steel 
industries, concluded that the CVG enterprises are in critical 
condition, some of them technically bankrupt, such as Alcasa, 
with liabilities more than double their assets. 
<H5>  Properly Planned Privatization </H5>
  The drafters of the report evaluate each of the six 
enterprises in the aluminum and iron and steel industries 
separately but offer overall conclusions and recommendations 
that are valid for them all. 
  They blame the CVG, as the agency that promotes the region's 
industrial development and as a major shareholder in the 
enterprises, for having spurred new projects and expanded 
existing ones without the capital investments by shareholders 
needed to complete them. 
  Most of the time these funds were not forthcoming, according 
to one of the conclusions, and other times they arrived 
belatedly. As a result, the enterprises had to resort urgently 
to short- and long-term borrowing, which in turn has meant huge 
financial costs for them, with the resulting damage to the 
industries' capital resources. 
<H5>  Aluminum Sector in Danger </H5>
  The report notes that the enterprises in the aluminum sector 
are in a critical, perilous condition owing to the steady 
decline in international prices, which has seriously disrupted 
their operations. This, along with the failure to recognize the 
industries' external debts and the sharp rise in international 
interest rates, explains the magnitude of the crisis. 
  Maintaining operating efficiency until 1989 and closing down 
inefficient, obsolete production lines were necessary steps. 
Today they are indispensable. 
  In another regard, the report says that now that the 
government has capitalized 60 percent of the SIDOR [Orinoco Iron 
and Steelworks] debt, the iron and steel sector is in less 
danger and its financial indices reflect reasonably good 
performance; as a result, its problems are altogether manageable. 
  In conclusion, it states that privatization should not be 
viewed dogmatically, arguing that although it is not a panacea 
for the problems of the CVG enterprises, it should not be 
regarded as harmful to the national interest either. 
<H5>  Alcasa [Caroni Aluminum, Inc.] </H5>
  This enterprise has structural problems, as reflected in the 
fact that its manufacturing costs stand at some 18.06 billion 
bolivars while its sales are around 17.6 billion. 
  It also faces a serious insolvency problem, as it has a 
working capital deficit of 21.1 billion bolivars, which is 
equivalent to more than 14 months of sales. 
  This enterprise, the report finds, is technically bankrupt 
unless shareholders give it fresh infusions of investment 
capital. In practice, Alcasa's creditors own it, and unless an 
estimated $300 million in investments is forthcoming, the best 
option is to close it down. 
<H5>  Venalum [Aluminum Company of Venezuela, Inc.] </H5>
  Venalum also has structural problems, as its manufacturing 
costs stand at 97.3 bolivars for every 100 in sales. 
  Its debt amounts to 44.6 billion bolivars, with assets of 
63.9 billion, a ratio of 0.7 to 1, which can be regarded as very 
sound financially. 
<H5>  Interalumina </H5>
  Its manufacturing costs were equivalent to 83 percent of 
costs in 1992, a very high ratio (it should not be more than 70 
percent). 
  The enterprise is reasonably solvent, with working capital 
of 
around 7.7 billion bolivars, although the reducers have a 15 
billion bolivar debt that they would seem unable to pay back in 
the short run. 
<H5>  Bauxiven [Venezuelan Bauxite, Inc.] </H5>
  As of December 1992 this project required 23 billion in 
investments, and only 4.5 billion was forthcoming. As a result, 
it is beginning operations with a heavy financial burden and a 
high indebtedness index. 
  It is failing to comply with the IDB and FIV financing 
agreements. 
<H5>  SIDOR </H5>
  Its manufacturing costs have remained very high, reaching 90 
percent of sales in 1992. 
  Its current ratio during the years under study can be 
considered reasonable, and its working capital as of the end of 
1992 was 27.5 billion bolivars. 
  The government's capitalization of its debt obviously 
improved its debt ratio. 
<H5>  Ferrominera </H5>
  Its manufacturing costs rose from 50 to 60 percent of sales. 
This means that cutbacks have to be made in order to reverse the 
trend back to 40 percent, which would be acceptable for this 
mining firm. 
  Its debt ratio stood at 2.69 in 1992, and the enterprise's 
current ratio is slightly worse.

FT  02 JUL 92 / Lowering the oil flag: The Venezuelan search is on for
foreign partners in the production of crude
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S decision to allow private companies to produce oil from a series
of inactive fields is not only an important break with the past but also the
first concrete example of private capital investment in the oil production
sector since the country's petroleum industry was nationalised in 1976.
Mr Alirio Parra, energy and mines minister, announced on June 19 that Royal
Dutch/Shell and smaller companies from Japan, the US and Venezuela would
invest Dollars 720m (Pounds 390m) over the next 10 years to produce crude
from five groups of inactive fields.
The private companies are assuming the entire financial risk - no oil, no
return. How much they earn will depend solely on the volume of oil produced
because even though they are spending money on production infrastructure,
they will not own the crude. All output will be turned over to subsidiaries
of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA.
Shell's return to Venezuela as an investor in the oil sector is not without
irony. When all private oil companies were nationalised 16 years ago,
Shell's operation was second only to Exxon's. Both companies had to wait
more than a decade for their claims to be settled with the government.
It was President Carlos Andres Perez, waving the banner of nationalism, who
ordered the state takeover of foreign oil companies during his previous term
in office. Now, he is supporting PDVSA efforts to open petroleum sectors
such as exploration, production and refining to foreign capital.
However, while Venezuela is only encouraging foreign capital in its oil
industry, the state company has invested well over Dollars 1bn since 1983 to
purchase full or part-ownership in oil refining and distribution systems in
Europe and the US.
The agreements covering the inactive fields, due for signature this month,
are what PDVSA executives hope will be the first in a series of new
investments by international oil companies. Private concerns have invested
for many years in Venezuelan petrochemicals; large sums are flowing into the
sector. But petroleum and natural gas have been out of bounds until now.
In late 1990, PDVSA announced a large natural gas liquefaction project in
eastern Venezuela, in partnership with Exxon, Mitsubishi and Shell. Studies
of the Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn project are continuing, but no large
investments have yet been made, and its fate hangs on natural gas prices
worldwide. Venezuelans are keen to sell their liquefied natural gas in the
US.
Since Mr Perez took office for the second time in early 1989, PDVSA has also
been encouraging other joint ventures with international oil companies in a
variety of areas, including exploration, production and refining.
The state company has the world's largest proven reserves of heavy and
extra-heavy petroleum, and is stressing what it calls 'strategic
associations' with international companies to produce and refine heavy oil.
Despite Venezuela's strong interest in heavy oil, foreign companies consider
it uneconomical while there are abundant light and medium-grade crudes
available from the Middle East. PDVSA is in the midst of a multi-billion
dollar capital investment programme which must be funded not only by
internal cash flow, but also by export credits, loans and equity from
abroad.
Mr Perez and many other former proponents of a fully-national industry have
understood the need for foreign capital and loans if PDVSA is to grow and
remain competitive.
The company today remains well managed and profitable. The political
instability resulting from an unsuccessful military uprising last February
has not affected operations so far.
However, its capital investment needs are being squeezed by lower than
expected oil prices and a high tax bite (82 per cent of operating profits)
by a government addicted to petroleum revenues.
Last year, taxes on PDVSA provided the central government with more than 70
per cent of total revenues.
To cope with its capital shortage, PDVSA has reduced investment this year
and delayed or prolonged some large projects. The company also is seeking
funds on international capital markets.
A subsidiary, Corpoven, recently gave a mandate to CS First Boston to raise
Dollars 300m to finance the expansion of a natural gas plant. This year, two
US banks tried to raise money for PDVSA, but company officials said they
decided the placements would be too costly and the efforts were dropped.
News reports of popular protests, demands for the resignation of Mr Perez
and other symptoms of political instability have affected investors'
perceptions.
PDVSA has external debts of Dollars 2.16bn and loans from Venezuelan banks
totalling around Dollars 923m. The company will need borrowed money to
finance most of its investment programme this year and next.
Capital outlays last year were Dollars 3.7bn. Before the cuts, this year's
figure was projected at well over Dollars 4bn.

<HL> Venezuela Calls For OPEC Panel To Meet on Prices </HL>

<TEXT>
   Alarmed over falling oil prices, Venezuela officially called for a meeting of the pricing committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 

   The request for such a meeting, which had been expected, came amid growing concern over weakening oil markets and, in some cases, outright resentment of OPEC. Mexico, which isn't a member but has supported OPEC policies in the past, turned sharply critical. 
"OPEC has demonstrated, once again, its inability to stabilize the market and maintain prices," Notimex, the official news agency of Mexico, said yesterday. 

   In Caracas, oil officials confirmed that Venezuela, a member of the pricing group, sent messages requesting the meeting to the four others on the committee: Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Indonesia. 
"We are making this call because we consider that the market situation has characteristics of alarm," Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, Venezuela's oil minister, said. 
He said a date for the meeting of the five-minister pricing committee wouldn't be set until the others responded to the Venezuelan request. 

   The pricing committee is charged by OPEC with monitoring world oil prices. 
It cannot take official action on its own, but it is authorized to call a special meeting of all 13 ministers of OPEC for possible changes in the exporters' official pricing structure and production quotas. 

   Some OPEC sources are skeptical that a full ministerial meeting will be held before a previously scheduled July conference even if the pricing group calls for one -- largely because of Saudi Arabia's opposition to any special session. 
But some sources said the Saudis might drop their opposition if prices stayed below $15. 

   Currently, world oil prices generally range between $14 and $15 a barrel. 
Some prices have plunged as much as $4 a barrel since mid-December, when officials at OPEC's winter meeting seemed unable to come to grips with excess production by member nations in the face of high oil inventories. 

   Some crude oil traders said that a possible meeting of OPEC's pricing committee could have a firming effect on the market. 
But prices on spot and futures markets softened further yesterday. 
On the U.S. futures market, West Texas Intermediate crude closed at $15.35 a barrel, down 25 cents. 

   Also, according to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, Petroleos de Venezuela notified U.S. customers that export prices of its heavy crudes, which are excluded from OPEC's pricing system, have been reduced between 68 cents and $1.90 a barrel. 
Venezuela's export price of its benchmark heavy crude, Bachaquero 17, was cut $1 to $11.20 a barrel.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers raided illegal gold mines in
the Amazon jungle and arrested more than 300 people, mostly
foreigners, Foreign Minister Reinaldo Figueredo said Saturday.
   Most of the illegal miners detained in last week's raids were
taken to Puerto Ayacucho, a jungle outpost on the Orinoco River
about 400 miles south of Caracas, where they were to be tried on
charges of damaging the environment, authorities said.
   Since last year, the federal government has made more than 1,000
arrests in attempting to staunch an invasion of miners crossing the
unmarked jungle border between Brazil and Venezuela.
   The mining process, which uses mercury, has been blamed for
poisoning rivers and for the deaths of several Yanomami Indians in
Venezuela's isolated, largely roadless Amazonas territory.
   The government is trying to protect the estimated 14,000
Yanomami living in Venezuela, possibly the most isolated and
largest primitive tribe remaining on earth.
   Defense Minister Hector Jurado Toro said about 800 soldiers were
involved in the sweep. The troops dismantled mining operations and
detained everyone who did not manage to escape into the jungle, he
said.

   Abitibi-Price Inc. said it tentatively agreed with Bowater Inc. and Venezuelan investors to build and operate a newsprint mill in Venezuela. 

   Abitibi said the proposed mill on the Orinoco River near Ciudad Guayana would be about 49%-owned by Abitibi and Darien, Conn.-based Bowater, both major producers of newsprint; 36% by the Venezuelan government; and 15% by Gruprensa, a group of Venezuelan publishers. 

   A spokeswoman for Abitibi said the mill is expected to cost $350 million to $450 million, depending on exchange rates and inflation. 
She said financing is still under negotiation. 

   Abitibi said the proposed mill would have capacity of 200,000 metric tons annually from one machine, and be designed so a second machine could be added at a later date. 
It said Bowater and Abitibi would oversee construction and operate the mill. 
It said most of the newsprint would be exported and marketed by Bowater and Abitibi. 

   Abitibi said a letter of intent was signed by the participants yesterday. 
It said the agreement is subject to various conditions, including financing and approval by the boards of the participating companies. 

   The mill would be Abitibi's first venture outside North America, the spokeswoman said. 

   Bowater confirmed that Venezuela requested it and Abitibi to become joint technical partners in the project.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored by Panama 
Bureau through 17 January; source follows in parentheses after 
each item. 
  Health and Development Ministry sources reported on 11 
January that medicine prices will be controlled. Prices 
skyrocketed--some increased by 200 percent in certain 
cases--after the announcement of implementation of the value 
added tax. Prices will be set at December 1993 levels, 
following an agreement with pharmaceutical industry 
representatives. The government also placed 10 staple items 
under price control to prevent further speculation. (Paris AFP 
in Spanish 0054 GMT 12 Jan 94) 
  Venezuelan Petroleum, Petroven, plans to invest 140 billion 
bolivares in the refining field. The budget includes 120 
million bolivares, which will be channeled to the Amuay and 
Cardon Refineries. Gustavo Roosen, Petroven president, has 
announced that Venezuelan refineries have processed an average 
of 949,000 barrels per day. Amuay has 440,000 barrels, and 
Cardon processed 265,000 barrels per day. Investments in 
refining installations totaled 80 billion bolivares in 1993. 
(Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 14) 
  The Energy and Mines Ministry has reported that the mining 
industry has extracted products worth 74.8 billion bolivares, 
including gold, steel, diamonds, coal, bauxite, granite, marble, 
phosphate and other minerals. Steel topped the list with 33.4 
billion bolivares for its 20.5 million metric tons. Gold and 
diamonds each produced 9.1 billion bolivares; coal produced 
10.65 billion bolivares, and bauxite registered 5.83 billion 
bolivares. Foreign currency influx totaled $1.3 billion, while 
expenditures totaled $930 million. The difference, $384 
million, is a considerable increase over 1992's $93 million. 
(Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 14) 
  The government has reported paying 116 billion bolivares to 
the national debt. Finance Ministry officials have issued a 
report stating that 88.6 billion bolivares went to capital 
payment and the remainder went to interest and service payments. 
Despite the payment, the national debt grew by 84 million 
bolivares, however, to 219.579 billion bolivares. (Caracas EL 
GLOBO in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 10) 
  Maraven, a subsidiary of Petroven, reported shipping 256.7 
million barrels of crude oil during 1993, of which 152 million 
barrels were shipped abroad, and 100 million barrels were sent 
to the Cardon Refinery. Despite repair and remodeling work at 
its Miranda Port facilities, the corporation has stated that it 
met its storage and shipping goals for the year. According to 
management spokespersons, this volume sets a record in the 
corporation's 34 years of operations. (Caracas EL GLOBO in 
Spanish 14 Jan 94 p 14) 
  Despite the weakening international oil market, the 
Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation has reported income of $2.5 
billion during 1993. Corpoven listed exports of 653,000 barrels 
per day of crude oil and refined products. Corpoven has 
announced that it had successfully managed to sell oxygenated 
gasolines to the demanding U.S. market, which made 1993 an 
especially productive year. (Caracas Venezolana de Television 
Network in Spanish 1550 GMT 14 Jan 94)

VENEZUELA: THE GULF CRISIS BRINGS A WINDFALL TO NATION BESET BY AUSTERITY

As the world struggles to resolve the gulf crisis, Venezuela's big new problem 
is what to do with a windfall of petrodollars. 
</P>
<P>
And Venezuelans are debating what to do with the money -- whether to pay off 
their debt or invest in social programs to ease the heavy burden of the 
country's austerity measures. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the Western world. Within 
three weeks of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, oil platforms in Lake Maracaibo were 
pumping 350,000 more barrels a day. By year's end, output will rise to 500,000 
barrels a day above the country's previous quota of 1.9 million barrels a day, 
as set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We will gain an extra $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion in oil revenues this year," 
said Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister. Venezuela stands to gain $1 
billion a year for every $1 a barrel rise in wholesale prices, say officials of 
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state-run oil company. 
</P>
<P>
This privileged situation has raised the expectations of the average 
Venezuelan, whose pocketbook has been hit by government austerity measures and 
unemployment. Last year, Venezuela's economy shrank 8%, overall unemployment 
reached 10%, and inflation was cut to 30% from 85% a year ago, the Ministry of 
Finance said. Union leaders say 500,000 people have lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, the standoff in the gulf is a blessing," said Pedro Ibarra, a Caracas 
shoe store owner. "The question we are all asking ourselves is: What is the 
government going to do with the oil bonus?" 
</P>
<P>
The government is "debating what to do with the extra funds," said Marcos 
Morales, who leads an economic policy team. "We don't want to count our eggs 
before they hatch. We remain cautious. You never know what the price of oil 
will be tomorrow." Morales, however, thinks the windfall will wipe out the $1 
billion 1990 budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In street markets, government offices and newspapers, three options are talked 
about: paying off debt to stabilize the economy; reinvesting in the state-run 
oil company to expand oil production; or investing in social programs to ease 
the burden of austerity. Advocates of paying off Venezuela's foreign debt 
include businessmen and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"The debt is the heaviest burden we have ever suffered in our history," said 
Sen. Pedro Paris Montesinos. In mid-August, private banks cut Venezuela's 
foreign debt by 20% to $18 billion, and debt payments were cut by 50%. In 
return, the government will continue austerity rules that help it pay. Still, 
Venezuela faces annual payments of up to $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The gulf crisis is a bonanza," said businessman Jose Marquez. "But in the long 
haul, paying off the debt will guarantee that, no matter what happens to the 
price of the barrel, our economy will be at last stabilized." 
</P>
<P>
Others believe improving the state-run oil company is as important as fixing 
the economy. "We have a very ambitious plan," said PDVSA's Paul Reimpell. "We 
are going to operate at full capacity in the coming year and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
From the wellhead to the gas pump, improvement efforts are under way, oil 
company officials say. But money is needed to reactivate 13,000 idle wells to 
meet demand. About 80% of company earnings goes to the government, with 20% 
reinvested, Reimpell said. Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez has said 
some oil bonus money may be used to expand production, some of it for a 
rainy-day fund. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, say Perez wants to overexpand production to satisfy Third 
World countries and boost his image as a spokesman for the developing world -- 
a role he played as president in the 1970s. Under a 10-year deal between 
Venezuela, Mexico and others, Venezuela has been selling oil at $17 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
But some at home wonder why Perez does not solve their many problems. "We 
demand water, electricity, a better health system, and an end to the rise in 
prices," said Marcos Fiel Loaiza, a social activist. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Perez's new austerity measures sparked riots that killed 300 and 
injured 1,000. The Perez free-market plan abolished price controls, reduced 
government subsidies, freed exchange rates and moved to privatize state-run 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered street protests have erupted over plans to raise gas prices from 26 
to 28 cents a gallon. In slums in the city, water shortages have led to 
demonstrations. Simmering discontent was evident in a recent poll. Sixty-five 
percent of 1,500 respondents thought the economy would worsen, and 53% 
disapproved of Perez's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old story," said Fiel Loaiza. "We live in a country rich in oil 
and natural resources and somehow the benefits of our national wealth never 
trickled down to the people."

FT  07 JUL 94 / Caracas fixes single rate against dollar: Bolivar pegged in
new foreign exchange controls
</HEADLINE>

The Venezuelan government announced a single exchange rate of 170 bolivars
to the US dollar late on Tuesday, following more than a week of
deliberations on new foreign exchange controls.
On June 23, the last day of trading, the bolivar stood at about 200:Dollars
1, down from 106 at the end of 1993.
The imposition of exchange controls came after months of heavy pressure on
Venezuela's international reserves, caused by a crisis in the banking
system, much rumour and a marked deterioration in the economy.
Announcing the controls, Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said he hoped they
would be temporary. They would be accompanied by a series of macroeconomic
measures aimed to balance the 1994 and 1995 budgets, he said, giving no
details.
The government had rejected the idea of a parallel free market in foreign
exchange, he said, because it feared 'destabilising agents' would create an
unacceptable gap between the official rate and the parallel rate. Any
foreign exchange trading outside the official system would be illegal and
subject to penalties, he warned.
The controls will cover imports, expenses of Venezuelan students abroad,
external debt payments for the public and the private sector, spending by
travellers, and 'small remittances' by foreigners in Venezuela to relatives
abroad.
Officials stressed that the government would meet all international
commitments and provide foreign exchange to international investors, to
allow for profit remittances. Mr Sosa also argued that the new exchange rate
would help international investors, by removing the penalty of the
'speculative' exchange rates seen in recent months.
He said the system of assigning foreign exchange would be 'highly automated
and transparent', and would be set up with the help of PDVSA, Venezuela's
national oil company.
However, foreign exchange trading at the new rate was not to resume
yesterday, as planned, due to 'technical questions' at the central bank.
Commercial banks said yesterday that they expected trading to resume on
Monday.
The new programme is Venezuela's fourth foreign exchange system since
President Rafael Caldera took office in February. The first was a
crawling-peg system used by the central bank until its president, Mrs Ruth
de Krivoy, resigned at the end of April over disagreements with the Caldera
administration. This was followed briefly by a limited auction system at the
central bank, then by a modified version of a Dutch auction, in effect until
June 23.
Mr Sosa stressed that the government has enough monetary reserves to meet
Venezuela's import and foreign debt obligations, but not enough to finance
capital flight. Officials estimate 'normal' foreign exchange sales to be
about Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.5m) each business day. PDVSA supplies the
central bank with about Dollars 40m a day from oil exports.
The central bank has not issued figures on monetary reserves since April,
when the bolivar began to slip, but a Caracas daily, citing figures from the
government planning office, reported that gross international reserves at
the end of May stood at Dollars 9.9bn, down 21 per cent from Dollars 12.6bn
at the end of 1993.
