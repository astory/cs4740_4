   Spain's plans to stage a
headline-grabbing 500th birthday party for America in 1992 have
stirred up a storm of controversy over how Portugal is celebrating
its own discoverers, who were charting the Atlantic before
Christopher Columbus was born.
   Spain and Portugal were archrivals in the push in the 15th and
16th centuries to sail off the end of known maps and find new
worlds. Both succeeded.
   But now, many Portuguese fear their neighbors are stealing the
limelight for the 1992 fiesta.
   At the center of Spain's celebrations is Seville's Expo '92, a
530-acre international fair that is set to end a six-month run Oct.
12, 1992, 500 years to the day after Columbus reached the Caribbean
island of San Salvador.
   Also making Spain hot property in 1992 will be the excitement of
the Summer Olympic games in Barcelona. And the European Economic
Community has chosen Madrid as its cultural capital on the eve of
the trading bloc's deadline to create a single European market.
   Compared with all that, Portugal's 1992 celebrations seem
lackluster.
   Lisbon's government-appointed National Discoveries Commission is
promoting research, exhibitions and the publishing of more history
books about the era.
   It has commissioned American composer Philip Glass to write an
opera for 1992 release, based probably on the Lusiads _ an epic
poem about Vasco da Gama's voyages that was written by Portugal's
16th century roving bard, Luis de Camoes.
   But the Spaniards got there first by casting Catalan soprano
Montserrat Caballe and tenor Jose Carreras in Cristobal Colon, an
opera based on trials and tribulations of the Genoese captain. It
sold out when it premiered in Barcelona in September.
   News media, executives and even historians here have called for
more glamour to promote Portugal's past glories and to show that it
is a rapidly modernizing European country.
   ``I'm ashamed at how my country is celebrating the
discoveries,'' said Waldemar de Abreu, a Lisbon publisher and
editor of ``The Portuguese Christopher Columbus _ Secret Agent of
King Dom Joao II,'' a 600-page book that claims proof the explorer
was Portuguese.
   ``Portugal could easily have pooled resources with Spain and
staged an Iberian discoveries exhibition in 1992,'' de Abreu said.
   While admitting Spain ``is pegging all the force of its
modernization on 1992,'' Vasco Graca Moura, head of the
Commission's executive board, makes no apologies for not going
overboard in that year.
   ``The main difference is that Spain is only commemorating one
date and a short journey _ Columbus' voyage in 1492 to the West
Indies,'' he said.
   ``Our celebrations began last year with Bartolomeu Dias and will
only end in 2000, with Pedro Alvares Cabral.''
   Spurred by their pioneering Prince Henry the Navigator's studies
of astronomy and cartography, Portuguese seafarers had claimed the
island of Madeira and the mid-Atlantic Azores archipelago by 1430.
   Dias took his ship around the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, leaving
da Gama to open up the sea route to India 10 years later.
   Cabral discovered Brazil in 1500, the Portuguese went east of
India to Japan, and Fernao de Magalhaes _ better known as Magellan
_ closed the Discoveries circle in 1520 by commanding the first
expedition to sail around the world.
   ``Our commemorations match our dimension _ we're smaller than
Spain, so honestly we can't be as elaborate,'' said the
commission's Antonio Mega Ferreira, though adding Portugal still
has a few tricks up its sleeve.
   Lisbon last week submitted its candidacy to the Paris-based
International Exhibitions Bureau, to hold Expo '98 _ a three-month,
international fair, only about a tenth the size of Seville.
   Instead of trying for the Olympics, Portugal is expected to bid
in January to hold soccer's World Cup in 1998.
   Expo '98's theme will be East meets West, its hero _ Vasco da
Gama. Graca Moura argues da Gama's trips to the Orient were as
important as Columbus' discovery in the West.
   Mega Ferreira's plans for Expo '98 include a subway train
connecting the undeveloped left bank of the Tagus estuary with
Lisbon's historic Belem district.
   Belem is already the site of three ornate monuments to the
discoveries _ Belem tower and Jeronimos monastery, and former
dictator Antonio Oliveira Salazar's colossal, caravel-shaped
``Padrao'' _ a pillar that navigators used to leave behind them on
land to mark the spread of the Portuguese empire.
   Salazar in 1940 organized an exhibition called ``O Mundo
Portugues'' _ the Portuguese world, that glorified the country's
discoveries and African empire to distract attention from its
isolation in Europe and World War II that was going on around it.
   ``The (center-right) government has a complex of being linked to
Salazar. They're frightened they'd be accused of nationalism, if
they did more to glorify our history,'' de Abreu said. ``But
nobody's accusing Spain's socialist government of anything, and
what is Seville if not a glorification of Spain's colonial past?''

   Vasco da Gama and Ferdinand Magellan may
seem unlikely rivals for Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. But under an
ambitious plan by a group of U.S. businessmen, the 15th-century
Portuguese explorers could vie with Walt Disney stars as major
European theme park attractions.
   A U.S.-owned company, backed by the Portuguese government, is
planning an $80 million to $100 million theme park near Lisbon,
based on the pioneering Portuguese sea voyages to Africa, Asia and
the New World some 500 years ago.
   The Lusolandia park is set for a 1993 opening, one year after
the scheduled launch of a Euro Disneyland park in France.
   Lusolandia Holdings' chairman Edward Kane, a Boston native, said
the project sprang from Disney's rejection five years ago of an
idea from then Portuguese Prime Minister Mario Soares to locate a
European Disneyland in Portugal.
   As Lisbon representative of the Washington-based International
Trade and Guarantee Corp., a company advising U.S. businesses
abroad, Kane had been asked by Soares _ currently Portuguese
president _ to approach Disney.
   ``Walt Disney Enterprises basically said no way, Portugal is too
small potatoes for them,'' said Kane.
   Disney decided to locate closer to Europe's more affluent and
densely populated ``golden triangle'' formed by London, Paris and
Brussels. Their French amusement park program foresees costs of up
to $2.8 billion to 1997.
   After Disney's refusal, Kane turned to Management Resources, an
Anaheim, Calif., company specialized in creating and running theme
parks and formed by ex-Disney employees.
   ``I had the idea of ... instead of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck
... let's make it a Portuguese historical theme park, let's replace
Donald Duck with Bartolomeu Dias and Mickey Mouse with Vasco da
Gama,'' said Kane, a retired U.S. foreign service officer.
   Portuguese authorities backed the plan, and Mangagement
Resources enthusiastically joined the project. Feasibility studies
predicted 2.15 million first-year customers from Portugal's 10
million inhabitants and foreign visitors to Portugal who last year
topped 16 million.
   The park is to be built near the town of Azambuja, some 28 miles
northeast of Lisbon along the main north-south freeway to Oporto,
Portugal's second city.
   Kane said the park will also have good road links to Portugal's
main tourist destination _ the southern Algarve region _ and to
neighboring Spain. The site proposed for a new Lisbon international
airport is 7 miles to the east of the park location.
   Visitors will enter the 247-acre park into a mock-up of
Renaissance Lisbon, complete with castle and 15th century main
street.
   From a reconstructed quayside, replicas of the explorers'
caravels will carry would-be Magellans on a voyage of discovery
across an artificial lake to ``theme areas'' representing Brazilian
jungles, mysterious African kingdoms and the glittering
civilizations of India, China and Japan.
   Kane said the latest technology will be used to create a
fun-as-you-learn environment for adults and children. The park
publicity brochure promises ocean storms and Amazonian canoe trips
as well as cultural exhibitions highlighting lands along the
Portuguese sea routes.
   Portuguese historians will advise on the park's authenticity and
experts from other countries will be contacted to set up Japanese
tea houses and African dance displays.
   Lusolandia Holdings is registered in Bermuda and owned 50-50 by
Management Resources and International Trade and Guarantee Corp.
   Soon, Kane said, they will be joined by a Portuguese partner and
create a Portuguese company _ Lusolandia Empreedimentos Turisticas.
   Private financing for the project is being sought mainly in
Europe. Kane also hopes to gain Portuguese government funding and
is discussing loan prospects with the Luxembourg-based European
Investment Bank.
   The Portuguese government has created a special task force of
officials from four ministries to steer the project through
Lisbon's bureaucratic maze.
   Inspired by the ideas of Prince Henry the Navigator, Portuguese
14th and 15th century mariners undertook a series of voyages that
expanded Europe's perception of the world and opened contacts with
the people of other continents.
   Dias became the first man to sail beyond the shores of North
Africa down the West African coast to the Cape of Good Hope in
1488, da Gama discovered the sea route to India in 1499 and Pedro
Alvares Cabral first landed in Brazil in 1500. Sailing under
Spanish colors, Magellan began the first circumnavigation of the
globe in 1519.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (8): Facelift for an anniversary / A look
at preparations for Expo '98
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal has every right to be proud of its illustrious past, and the manner
in which it recalls events in its history that the rest of the world ignores
is nothing short of endearing.
Few outside Portugal, for example, are aware that 1991 was the 500th
anniversary of the first Portuguese mission to the kingdom of the Congo, or
that 2000 will mark the the 500th anniversary of the colonisation of Brazil,
or that this year celebrates the 600th anniversary of the birth of Prince
Henry the Navigator whose intellectual stimulus and deep pockets made such
milestones possible.
The world outside Portugal may, however, become aware of the significance of
1998 as the year marking 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's voyage to
India. If it does it will be because of Lisbon's Expo '98, an international
exposition which hopes to attract 115 participants, countries, multinational
companies and international organisations, and 10m visitors.
Expo '98, has chosen an attractive theme: under the title The Oceans, a
Heritage for the Future, it will focus on conserving the oceans and also on
realising the sustainable assets that the two thirds of planet earth
represented by the oceans can provide. The question is whether it can
deliver this appealing package.
Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, a former EC commissioner and now commissioner for
Expo '98, brushes the doubters aside. The world fair will happen as planned
because much more than being an occasion to wave the Vasco da Gama flag,
more even than providing a platform for ecological correctness, Expo '98 is
the excuse for a significant urban facelift that Lisbon can no longer delay.
Already the state-owned Expo '98 consortium is beginning to decontaminate
and to level a 300-hectare industrial garbage area on Lisbon's eastern
suburbs, upriver and alongside the river Tagus estuary, that was formerly
occupied by a succession of petroleum refineries and factories.
It is an undertaking comparable to the renewal of London's Docklands or to
Barcelona's decision to uproot a similar rust belt to construct an Olympic
village. Mr Cardoso believes that Lisbon is not only 'fit to meet' such an
undertaking but 'desperately needs to do so'.
The stimulus is all-important. 'If the objectives are not foolish, if they
are reasonable, then societies need this sort of psychological challenge,'
says Expo '98's commissioner and his views echo those of Barcelona mayor
Pascual Maragall in the run up to the 1992 summer games.
Expo '98 will not, however, be a repeat of the Expo '92 jamboree in Seville
that marked the 500 years of Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the New
World. That was a 'universal' exposition, a higher rank than the
'international' exposition accolade awarded to Lisbon by the BIE, the
Paris-based organisation which monitors world fairs. With hindsight, Lisbon
perceives Expo '92 as having been too costly, too ambitious and, ultimately,
too wasteful.
'One of our main concerns is not to be Seville mark two,' says Mr Cardoso.
The Lisbon event will be shorter - four months, June to September, instead
of Seville's six - the exhibition space will be much smaller and, hopefully,
it will pay for itself by selling off its real estate to the private sector.
If all goes as Expo '98 plans it, Lisbon will be making a giant leap forward
over the next three years. It will acquire:
A second fixed link over the Tagus, a 15-kilometre six-lane highway thrown
across the estuary that will relieve pressure on the saturated existing
suspension bridge, down river, which dates from 1966.
A transport interchange centre serving buses, the city's metro system and
the main national railway traffic moving north-south and east towards the
Spanish border.
A big exhibition centre, a large multi-purpose indoor sports and music
stadium and the biggest oceanarium in Europe.
A new residential, office and commercial area, housing some 25,000 and,
scenically situated by the Tagus estuary's bulge, reminiscent in its
location of lakeside Chicago.
'Everybody has got his feelings at least a little mixed about such
ambitions,' says a Lisbon property developer. 'Clearing all that needs to be
cleared (the Expo '98 site extends along 5km of river front) and then
building all the complex things that are planned in under four years seems a
bit far-fetched.' The doubters point to the fact that Budapest has only
recently scrapped its own plans to have an Expo '96 because of time and
financing difficulties.
Mr Cardoso appears untroubled and he harks back to Vasco da Gama who was
'not a navigator' but a clear-sighted businessman. Getting to India was a
'trade-driven act' and by the same token the world fair on the 500th
anniversary of that voyage is a sound commercial venture moulded to the
city's requirements.
Indeed, Mr Cardoso seems intent on leaving nothing to chance as he preaches
the need to be 'hard, demanding and accurate' in the Expo '98 quest. He has
a poster of Murphy's Law - If things can go wrong they will - framed in his
office and he says that he has it hanging there to remind him and his staff
that 'everything has to be covered'.

   Today is Sunday, Dec. 24, the 358th day of 1989. There are seven
days left in the year. This is Christmas Eve.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Dec. 24, 1814, the War of 1812 officially ended as the United
States and Britain signed the Treaty of Ghent in Belgium. However,
because of the slowness of communications at that time, the
countries fought the Battle of New Orleans the following month.
   On this date:
   In 1524, Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama _ who had discovered
a sea route around Africa to India _ died in Cochin, India.
   In 1851, fire devastated the Library of Congress in Washington
D.C., destroying about 35,000 volumes.
   In 1865, several veterans of the Confederate Army formed a
private social club in Pulaski, Tenn., called the Ku Klux Klan.
   In 1871, Giuseppe Verdi's opera ``Aida'' had its world premiere
in Cairo, Egypt, to celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal.
   In 1906, Canadian physicist Reginald A. Fessenden became the
first person to broadcast a music program over radio, from Brant
Rock, Mass.
   In 1920, Enrico Caruso gave his last public performance, singing
the role of Eleazar in Jacques Halevy's ``La Juive'' at the
Metropolitan Opera in New York.
   In 1943, President Roosevelt appointed Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower
supreme commander of Allied forces as part of Operation Overlord.
   In 1968, the Apollo 8 astronauts, orbiting the moon, read
passages from the Old Testament Book of Genesis as part of a
Christmas Eve television broadcast to Earth.
   In 1980, Americans remembered the U.S. hostages in Iran by
burning candles or shining lights for 417 seconds _ one second for
each day of captivity.
   In 1986, French hostage Aurel Cornea, held in Lebanon for 9{
months, was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors.
   Ten years ago: Four clergymen from the United States were
allowed to meet with some of the American hostages in Iran to hold
Christmas services.
   Five years ago: The Soviet Union held funeral services for its
late defense minister, Dmitri F. Ustinov. The absence of President
Konstantin U. Chernenko fueled rumors of serious illness.

   Today is Saturday, Dec. 24, the 359th day of 1988. There are
seven days left in the year. This is Christmas Eve.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   Twenty years ago, on Dec. 24, 1968, the ``Apollo Eight''
astronauts, orbiting the moon, read passages from the Old Testament
Book of Genesis as part of a Christmas Eve television broadcast to
Earth.
   On this date:
   In 1524, Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama _ who had discovered
a sea route around Africa to India _ died in Cochin, India.
   In 1814, the War of 1812 ended as the United States and Britain
signed the Treaty of Ghent in Belgium.
   In 1851, fire devastated the Library of Congress in Washington,
D.C., destroying about 35,000 volumes.
   In 1865, several veterans of the Confederate Army formed a
private social club in Pulaski, Tenn., called the Ku Klux Klan.
   In 1871, Giuseppe Verdi's opera ``Aida'' had its world premiere
in Cairo, Egypt, to celebrate the opening of the Suez canal.
   In 1906, Canadian physicist Reginald A. Fessenden became the
first person to broadcast a music program over radio, from Brant
Rock, Mass.
   In 1920, Enrico Caruso gave his last public performance, singing
the role of Eleazar in Jacques Halevy's ``La Juive'' at the
Metropolitan Opera in New York.
   In 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower supreme commander of Allied forces as part of Operation
``Overlord.''
   In 1980, Americans remembered the U.S. hostages in Iran by
burning candles or shining lights for 417 seconds _ one second for
each day of captivity.
   In 1986, French hostage Aurel Cornea, held in Lebanon for 9{
months, was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors.
   Ten years ago: In Tehran, about 200 anti-shah demonstrators
shouting, ``Go home, Yankee'' and ``Down with the American Shah,''
tried to storm the U.S. Embassy, but were driven away by U.S.
Marines who fired tear gas at the protesters.
   Five years ago: U.S. Marine peacekeepers in Beirut, Lebanon, ate
a Christmas dinner of turkey and baked ham one day early for what
were described as security reasons.
   One year ago: In Lebanon, the kidnappers of Terry Anderson
released a videotape in which the Associated Press correspondent
told his family he was in good health, and said to President Reagan,
``Surely by now you know what must be done and how you can do it.''
   Today's Birthdays: Journalist I.F. Stone is 81. Actress Ava
Gardner is 66.
   Thought for today: ``If Christmas didn't already exist, man would
have had to invent it. There has to be at least one day in the year
to remind us we're here for something else besides our general
cussedness.'' _ Eric Sevareid, American journalist and commentator.

FT  18 JUL 94 / Business Travel: City for explorers - Peter Wise offers tips
on getting around and staying in Lisbon - and the etiquette of doing deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Portuguese, with self-deprecating humour, like to describe Lisbon as a
city of the developing world, rather than a European capital. The country's
historical involvement with Africa, Asia and the Arab world is evident in
the city's architecture, culture and cuisine - but on a technical level, it
functions almost on a par with the most modern of its European counterparts.
Doing business in Lisbon is rarely arduous and the hospitality of the
Portuguese usually makes it a pleasure. The city from where discoverers such
as Vasco de Gama and Fernao de Magalhaes (Magellan) set out in the 15th and
16th centuries enjoys being discovered by newcomers.
Lisbon will be welcoming more and more foreign businessmen over the next few
years, as the host to Expo '98 and the promoter of important infrastructure
projects, including new road and rail crossings over the Tagus river.
Visitors will discover that taxis are the best way to travel. They are
cheap, reliable and plentiful in the city centre. Except at rush hours,
nowhere is much more than 20 minutes away. Unless you are travelling to the
country's interior, it is not worth hiring a car (but if you do, it is often
cheaper to book outside Portugal).
There are good reasons for hailing a cab. First, it is virtually impossible
to park in Lisbon. Second, public transport is crowded and uncertain. The
yellow trams are fun but slow. Third, driving in Lisbon can be frightening.
Portugal has the highest road-accident rate in Europe. US soldiers at a Nato
base on one of the most dangerous roads out of Lisbon have had T-shirts
printed saying 'I survived the Marginal'.
The few sharks among Lisbon taxi drivers wait around the airport. The most
frequent trick is to clear the meter when you reach your destination and ask
for a higher fare. There is a 50 per cent surcharge for heavy luggage, but
it should be registered on the meter. Tolls are not shown, and are charged
double to cover the driver's return.
Company headquarters, banks, financial markets and government departments
are scattered around Lisbon. But most are within easy reach of the main
hotels.
The Tivoli, Ritz, Meridien and Sheraton offer the best five-star
accommodation. However, businessmen are increasingly staying at new three-
and four-stars hotels. The Sol Lisboa, Amazonia and Dom Rodrigo Lisboa,
which offers self-catering apartments for longer stays, provide good service
and ample space.
Most Portuguese businessmen speak English and French. A single foreign
visitor is enough for a meeting of 20 Portuguese executives to be held
entirely in English. A few words of Portuguese from a foreigner are taken as
a compliment, but not expected. It is not advisable to try out your Spanish.
The Portuguese do understand it, but pride themselves on the individuality
of their own language.
Punctuality is prized in Portugal, but rarely practised. As a foreigner,
however, you are expected to be on time.
The Portuguese are not overly formal. But the Anglo-Saxon habit of quickly
adopting first names can affront some sensibilities. Women wear skirts; men
wear suits or jackets and ties.
Lunch is a vital part of doing business. It begins at 1pm or 1.30pm and
lasts a minimum of 90 minutes, more often two hours. The city is teeming
with good restaurants, but a few are especially favoured for business
meetings. They include the Veranda at the Hotel Ritz, Gambrinus, Hotel da
Lapa, Casa da Comida and Chester. The latter attests to the penchant of
Lisbon businessmen for traditional British styles, from oak-panelled rooms
to tweed jackets. The Portuguese do not take a siesta and dinner starts no
later than 9pm.
Breakfast is a non-event, and it is unwise to organise business meetings
around it.
The most frequent business journey out of Lisbon is to the northern city of
Oporto. The aircraft is faster and more reliable than the train. Portugalia,
a small private airline, tends to be more efficient on this route than the
national carrier, TAP-Air Portugal.
On a free day, visit the romantic palaces of Sintra or the rolling plains of
the Alentejo.
Lisbon is this year's European Capital of Culture, making it a fertile city
for night life. The medieval Bairro Alto is a lively district of Fado music
houses, boxing clubs, boutiques, bars, restaurants, discotheques and
bordellos. Over the past three years, the clubs along the Avenida 24 de
Julho, beside the Tagus, have become the most fashionable. The action goes
on until dawn. No one has yet worked out when the young professionals who
dance the night away there actually sleep.

   Somebody Send Them a Fat Lady
   So They'll Know When It's Over

   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilians don't play baseball, so they
worry little about who's on first. But they're passionate
about soccer, and they wonder who's in first. First place,
that is.
   "In the end, who is the champion?" asked the headline in
Monday's Jornal do Brasil. Perplexed fans asked the same
question Sunday after watching both Botafogo and Vasco da
Gama run victory laps after their game at Maracana Stadium,
the 200,000-seat temple of soccer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On the face of it, it was simple. Botafogo won the game,
1-0, and has more points overall this season than Vasco.
   But this is Brazil, and nothing is ever that simple. Rules
are rules and, apparently, the rules say Botafogo may have
been the best team overall and won the final, but it didn't
win the championship. That's if you believe the rules that
were adopted in midseason, which aren't the same as the rules
that were enforced at the beginning of the season.
   Under the old rules, the soccer season is divided into two
legs, one won by Vasco and another won by a third team,
Fluminense; Vasco won the playoff between the two. On top of
that, however, if another team has more overall wins than the
two champions when the two legs of the season are combined,
it also has a right to dispute the prestigious championship
of the state of Rio de Janeiro. That was Botafogo's case, so
it had to play Vasco to determine the championship.
Botafogo's victory Sunday sealed the matter, so far as its
players and fans were concerned.
   But the rules were changed during this season's recess for
the World Cup, when the Soccer Federation decided that the
winner would be determined by a point system. Under that
system, Botafogo and Vasco were tied with one victory apiece
at the end of regulation time in Sunday's game and should
have played an overtime period to determine the overall
winner.
   Botafogo refused and left the field after a victory
celebration, so Vasco dubbed itself "the legal winner"
despite its defeat. "The rules exist and we complied with
them," proclaims Eurico Miranda, Vasco's vice president.
   Which leaves the championship a matter for a court
decision, and Botafogo faces expulsion for refusing to comply
with the rules. A ruling is expected within 20 days, but
soccer fans may have to be patient: The last time there was a
dispute over the title was in 1907, and the final decision on
that didn't come until 1989.

(Viking-Penguin), with brief excerpts of writings by travelers
ranging from the unknown diarist who was on Portuguese navigator

route to India around the Cape of Good Hope, to novelist Evelyn
Waugh, looking at Mt. Etna.

RETRACING BYRON'S STEPS IN 'GLORIOUS EDEN' 
</P>

SINTRA, Portugal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the words spoken and sung about Sintra, poet George Gordon Noel Byron's 
had the most lasting effect. When he put this flowering mountain town in 
"Childe Harold" he put Sintra on the map. "Glorious Eden," he called the city. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever he stayed Byron was taken with Sintra. He wrote his mother: "Sintra . 
. . contains beauties of every description, natural and artificial. Palaces and 
gardens rising in the midst of rocks, cataracts and precipices; convents on 
stupendous heights, a distant view of the sea and the Tagus." 
</P>
<P>
Sintra, 17 miles north of Lisbon, hasn't changed much from that description. 
Open are castles, convents, botanical gardens and Pena Palace, the wedding-cake 
structure that crowns the Serra de Sintra. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looks Like Balmoral 
</P>
<P>
Pena Palace was built by a cousin of Queen Victoria's Albert and resembles 
Balmoral on the inside, although it is more like Bavaria's Neuschwanstein on 
the outside. 
</P>
<P>
When Byron visited the mountain was topped by a monastery built by Manuel I in 
gratitude for the safe return of Vasco da Gama. The king was hunting on the 
mountain when the fleet was spied entering home waters. Monastery ruins include 
a chapel, an alabaster altar and a cloister. 
</P>
<P>
Farther down Pena Ridge, Byron undoubtedly walked the parapets of Castelo dos 
Mouros, an 8th-Century Arab stronghold later occupied by Norsemen. In the clear 
mountain air, views are still amazing. 
</P>
<P>
We know he hiked to Capuchos to see the Convento de Santa Cruz, a Capuchin 
monastery carved in the rock and insulated -- as well as furnished -- with 
cork. 
</P>
<P>
St. Honorius, a hermit who lived in a cave nearby, gets credit lines in Byron's 
poem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capuchos Monastery 
</P>
<P>
Capuchos is still a dark warren. Visitors are shown where eight penitents at a 
time lived in discomfort, despite such facilities as an infirmary, a dining 
room, a kitchen and an indoor bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Byron probably strode on to Colares, a town of vineyards and villas, pausing 
for bread, cheese and claret in a small taverna. 
</P>
<P>
An English merchant, Francis Cook, 40 years later claimed that Byron inspired 
him to import eminent horticulturists to the old monastery grounds at 
Monserrate to oversee exotica from Africa as well as Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Cook then built a bizarre neo-Oriental mansion for which he could blame no one 
but himself. 
</P>
<P>
Still later, another Englishman acquired Monserrate, sold the antique 
furnishings at a profit and proposed to divide the property into house plots. 
As shudders ran down the mountain, the Portuguese government stepped in and 
declared the place a national treasure. 
</P>
<P>
Today the gardens of Pena and Monserrate feature more than 3,000 plants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Twin Chimneys 
</P>
<P>
The distinctive twin chimneys of the Royal Palace of Sintra reminded Hans 
Christian Andersen of champagne bottles when he visited in 1866. 
</P>
<P>
Byron ignored them in "Childe Harold." 
</P>
<P>
The palace began as the home of a Moorish potentate, was taken by Alfonso 
Henriques, the first king of Portugal, in 1147, and early in the 15th Century 
was rebuilt as a summer palace for King Joao. 
</P>
<P>
A century later more additions were made by Manuel I, who lived there and was 
called "the Fortunate King." 
</P>
<P>
The romantic interior has a Swan Room that commemorates the wedding of Princess 
Isabela and Philip of Burgundy, and a Magpie Room -- to reprimand palace 
gossips after the king was caught kissing a lady-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Sintra's highland setting has always drawn those wilted by the summer heat of 
Lisbon, but it has remained a serene place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casinos and Beaches 
</P>
<P>
Casinos and condos belong to Estoril and Cascais at the foot of the mountain, a 
short trip by auto or bus. Equally convenient for today's visitor are the 
Atlantic Ocean beaches and such seaside villages as Ericeira, where lobsters 
are bred in nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
The Serra de Sintra ends in a spectacular cliff at Cabo da Roca, the 
westernmost point of Europe and a great place to watch the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Mafra, the combination Franciscan monastery and royal palace, was the object of 
a day's hike for Byron. The 800-room edifice included a 35,000-volume library, 
the pride of Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
Byron afterward told of the monk who guided them through and who asked politely 
if there were "any books in England?" 
</P>
<P>
Byron does not mention fog or mists, so he must have been as fortunate as we in 
having clear skies. It can be damp and gloomy at times, especially around 
Capuchos and Castelo dos Mouros. Byron would have appreciated the ghost 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
Displaced European nobility and expatriate Britishers still own the country 
estates -- the quintas -- of Sintra. 
</P>
<P>
Several quintas have become country-house hotels at which the line between paid 
and invited guests is casually drawn and the bedrooms are full of 
museum-quality antiques. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Swimming Pools 
</P>
<P>
Swimming pools and tennis courts dapple the manicured grounds. The horses and 
flower gardens are cloned from Kent. 
</P>
<P>
In Byron's eyes no place on the grand tour matched Sintra. He would write from 
Greece of a town "in the most beautiful situation (always excepting Sintra in 
Portugal) I ever beheld." 
</P>
<P>
He was not alone in praise. Robert Southey, English poet and historian, and 
William Beckford, an English author, also enticed British tourists to undertake 
what was then a rough ocean voyage. Portuguese poets would sing of it as "a 
garden of earthly Paradise" and claim "here is Spring enthroned." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen observed that some aspect of Sintra inevitably reminded the visitor of 
home. He saw in Sintra flashes of Denmark as we see California compared to New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen also said that Byron had stayed in "a private house now the Hotel 
Lawrence" on the Setais-Monserrate road. No hostelry of that name survives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Actually Three Towns 
</P>
<P>
Sintra is really three towns rising one after another on the mountain, with the 
oldest at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
On a second or fourth Sunday you can attend the street market in Sao Pedro de 
Sintra. Curio and antique shops are open in the Santa Maria section of town 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
It may not be that the cheese tarts known as Quejadas de Sintra were invented 
in Byron's day, nor that the cooks of 1809 added a mound of sauteed shrimp to 
the fresh-fried mountain trout "in the Sintra manner." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Byron visited only four days, July 12-16, then went to Spain, 
Greece and Turkey. Even Eden didn't hold the 21-year-old Byron for long. 
</P>

Article Type:BFN 

<F P=106> [Interview with Admiral Fuzeta da Ponte, Armed Forces chief </F>
of staff, by Jose Manuel Saraiva; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Saraiva] The EMGFA [Armed 
Forces General Staff] is a very bureaucratic structure. What 
will you do to make this body effective, open, and perhaps more 
modern? 
  [Fuzeta] In the first place, I will have to concern myself 
with a rigorous assessment of the degrees of readiness and 
maintenance of the Armed Forces. Over the past few years we 
have witnessed profound changes in the Armed Forces, ranging 
from the initiation of new laws governing the body to the new 
personnel recruitment and pay systems, with a view to the 
greater effectiveness of the Armed Forces. The changes in the 
EMGFA form part of a broader plan that I wish to implement and 
whose aim is to assess the final outcome of those changes. 
  [Saraiva] Do you believe that the material and human 
resources of the Armed Forces are sufficient to implement that 
plan? 
  [Fuzeta] No military chief anywhere in the world deems the 
available resources sufficient. In the first place, the needs 
are always very great. We must acknowledge that a great deal 
has been done in Portugal to improve the Armed Forces. This is 
a fact that must be acknowledged, but we must also remember that 
the recovery of the Armed Forces started from a very low 
point.... 
  [Saraiva] What do you mean by that? 
  [Fuzeta] I mean that our Armed Forces were already obsolete. 
Their modernization depends on the level of investment, which 
means that the greater the resources allocated to the Armed 
Forces, the more rapidly they will be able to achieve their 
aims. We are never satisfied. 
  [Saraiva] How do you explain young people's enormous lack of 
motivation to serve the Armed Forces? 
  [Fuzeta] This is a very serious matter. Over the years, the 
Portuguese people have always known how to defend the 
fatherland. They have always found considerable motivation to 
that end. Hence the motivation to serve the Armed Forces 
depends to some extent on the perception of the threats 
surrounding society at a given time. An individual immersed in a 
society over which looms a threat of disruption of peace is more 
motivated to serve the country than in the contrary situation. 
Moreover, it is important that it be said that something has 
been done to improve the motivation of the personnel serving in 
the Armed Forces. For instance, for career professionals the 
modernization of the new resources is a highly motivating 
factor. Any Army professional likes to have his M-60's, any Air 
Force man eagerly awaits the F-16's; naturally, any sailor is 
pleased with the Vasco da Gama-class frigates. With respect to 
the contract and volunteer personnel, in addition to these 
aspects we are also motivating them through accelerated 
vocational training, so that, after serving in the ranks, they 
will be reintegrated into civilian life. However, it is in 
education that the values that lead the Portuguese people to 
love their fatherland are instilled, and it is imparted in the 
schools and at home. 
  [Saraiva] With respect to the so-called performance of 
military duties, which system do you prefer -- compulsory 
military service or the volunteer and contract system? 
  [Fuzeta] The matter is eminently political. This is an 
important debate that should be conducted in the proper forum. 
Technically, there are Armed Forces that have opted for the 
volunteer system -- for instance, Britain -- and others that 
have chosen the compulsory system, such as France, and have not 
lost effectiveness on that account. I mean by this that it is 
possible to have effective Armed Forces both with the volunteer 
system and with the conscript system. In any event, no system 
is pure. All are hybrids. Right now, we have a roster of 
volunteers, but in the event of a crisis or war, we would still 
have to resort to general mobilization. 
  [Saraiva] You referred to vocational training aimed at the 
contractees and volunteers. Does the setting up of these 
institutes have any parallel in the armed forces of other 
countries? 
  [Fuzeta] There are similar measures in several European 
countries -- specifically, in France. 
  [Saraiva] But in Portugal this is a recent innovation whose 
sole aim seems to be to attract less-qualified young people to 
join up. 
  [Fuzeta] This is in the tradition of the great services to 
the nation performed by the Armed Forces. For many years, 
compulsory military service to some extent compensated for the 
basic education that was not given in the schools. It is well 
known that many young people from the poorest families who came 
from the most disadvantaged regions found a basic education in 
the forces, but now that tradition in the Armed Forces is 
exercised in a more sophisticated way. 
  [Saraiva] But there are those actually within the Armed 
Forces who say that the fighting military component could be 
disadvantaged for the benefit of a vocational training for which 
the forces are not, at first sight, designed? 
  [Fuzeta] On the contrary. We can only have fighting forces 
in Portugal if they are very well trained. We must have small, 
but good forces. There can be no good fighter without good 
training. So the vocational training process helps modernize the 
Armed Forces, and if that training can be projected outside, so 
as to benefit those whom have performed military service, I can 
see no harm in our civilianizing the training that we currently 
give young people. 
  [Saraiva] What role should the Armed Forces have in the 
prevailing international situation? 
  [Fuzeta] It is, of course, different from what it was five 
years ago, owing to the reduction in intensity of the East-West 
conflict. At that time, there was still a large number of 
forces settled on various fronts and with little flexibility. 
Today, the scene is completely different. In the current 
multipolar system we are witnessing several regional conflicts 
that require limited but well-trained and more flexible Armed 
Forces. In Portugal we must transform the Armed Forces, 
precisely so that we can use them strictly in Portugal's 
interest on the international scene. 
  [Saraiva] Do you believe that Portugal should participate 
more in international crises? For instance, during the Gulf 
war, some military men argued that the Portuguese Armed Forces 
should have taken part more actively in the conflict. 
  [Fuzeta] That is a political matter. It is the political 
power that decides on involvement of the Armed Forces. However, 
I will simply say that Portugal should act in the just defense 
of its interests. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The "old alliance" established 600 years 
ago between Portugal and Great Britain was a 
political-diplomatic agreement against the Spaniards, writes 
Jose Vegar in the 5 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO. Noting that 
"things are not much different today," it is still in Lisbon's 
strategic interest to align itself with the United Kingdom in 
the field of European construction, he contends. Vegar cites 
Carlos Gaspar, adviser to President Mario Soares, as saying that 
"it is necessary to choose the lesser of two evils, between 
those who wish to preserve Portugal's transatlantic vocation and 
the European Union (EU) and those who opt for subregional 
integrations that obviate the existence of the Community." In 
Gaspar's opinion, Portugal profits from aligning itself with 
Great Britain within the framework of the EU, for this 
"reinforces the tripartite center (France, Germany, United 
Kingdom)...so enlargement will not negatively affect it." Vegar 
cites Gaspar's concern about a possible fragmentation of the 
Union through the formation of subregional Scandinavian, 
Iberian, or German blocs. 
  On the other hand, Vegar also cites Andre Goncalves Pereira, 
former minister of foreign affairs, as saying that "there is no 
privileged relationship between Portugal and Great Britain." An 
alliance made sense when Portugal first entered the EC, given 
the somewhat parallel Portuguese and English positions on 
federalism at that time. However, following EC assistance to 
Portugal, Lisbon's present stance is much closer to the official 
EU position, which collides with London's traditional 
antifederalism, Goncalves Pereira is cited as saying. Vegar then 
cites Socialist Party (PS) luminary and former Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Jaime Gama, who notes that "it is to our 
advantage to maintain an intense relationship with the United 
Kingdom because we are partners in NATO and the EU." 
Nevertheless, Gama continues, the object of this alliance "was 
transferred from England to the United States, which 
unfortunately never occupied this vacuum because it has a 
different awareness of international issues." Finally, Gama is 
cited as claiming that the "old theory of Atlantic versus 
continental nations" cannot justify Portugal's interest in 
favoring a close relationship with Great Britain, for "the world 
is presently regulated by multipolarity, and a specific response 
to each problem is needed."

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Rare Operas by Meyerbeer and Rossini </HL>
<AUTHOR> Manuela Hoelterhoff </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> San Francisco  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong man could have rowed around the world more than once in the time it took Giacomo Meyerbeer to finish his opera about the explorer Vasco da Gama. 

   Finally, in 1864, after 25 years and who knows how many revisions, he thought he was just about done with "L'Africaine." 
And before he could change his mind again and add another country, a few more trills and two more ballets to his 4 1/2-hour extravaganza featuring four soloists and three elephants, death took the well-worn quill out of the hand of Europe's most applauded composer. ("Meyerbeer's mother is the second woman in history to see her son accepted as divine," snickered Heinrich Heine, Paris's other famous German Jew.) 

   So any production of this once overrated, now underrated composer is of interest. 
Admittedly this interest flickered on and off at the San Francisco Opera last weekend when the company revived this opera rarity after 16 years. 

   There was little to complain about when the stage offered Placido Domingo, all booted up and becomingly bearded as Vasco, or Shirley Verrett, in an attention getting hairdo (huge looped braids that looked like extra ears) as the slave queen Selika. 
But when they were out of sight, who was there to keep us awake and entertained? 
Not even a baby elephant. 

   You can't skimp with Meyerbeer. 
He knew this himself and took great care to place his cardboard characters in the most distractingly lavish productions money could buy. 
But this fabulously rich man is no longer around to push and pay for them, and the SFO's scenery was rather underwhelmingly modest, with the exception of Selika's tropical paradise, which is not in Africa, despite the title, for reasons known only to Meyerbeer. 

   Coherence was not furthered by the cuts, necessary I know, but clumsily done and in any event vitiated by the conductor Maurizio Arena, who took everything so slowly you wondered whether he might be composing some extra little bits as he went along. 

   Characters drop in from the oddest places, sometimes boarding ships from who knows where in the middle of a storming ocean. 
Very often they sing pretty tunes -- the most famous being Vasco's "O paradis" -- tunes that float above shimmering orchestrations but rarely are imbedded in a dramatic situation. 

   The best scene was the last, with the abandoned Selika sitting sadly on a seashore inhaling the poisonous fumes of a local tree, but getting off a lovely and long song before she goes. 
As Ms. Verrett poured her heart out, you had a vague notion why Meyerbeer's death was an occasion for national mourning. 

   "Weep! 
Weep! 
Sublime Muse," chanted a somber chorus to a mournful accompaniment of taps and drum rolls at Meyerbeer's funeral. 
This "chant funebre" was written by another neurotic, Gioachino Rossini, whose indolence was as legendary as Meyerbeer's. 
After a prolific youth, Rossini wrote no operas during the last 39 years of his life, partly to avoid competing with Meyerbeer, though he had more talent in his fat fingers than ever coursed through the German's sickly body. 

   This was pretty clear last weekend when the fearless SFO plunged even deeper down the memory hole to give Rossini's "opera seria" "Maometto II" its first staging in North America since the premiere in 1820. 

   Rossini specialists deem "Maometto" a purer and better opera than a later revision called "The Siege of Corinth" (which, revised even further, served as Beverly Sills's Metropolitan Opera debut in 1975). 
And there is indeed much to be said for it despite a dopey libretto that bears passing resemblance to "The Student Prince" (except that Rossini's disguised is not some German princeling, but the ruler of half the world). 
The opera's glorious trios develop with the pulsating energy that invariably eluded the bloodless Meyerbeer. 

   But for all that, this seems to be another opera that should be heard, not seen, at least not in a production this dreary (the Met's "Siege" sets, bought for a song, I hope). 
The walk-in tomb looked like the Fuhrer bunker. 
Maometto's tent at least was properly grand, if oddly furnished with a tilted bed that made you wonder how the famed conquerer conquered anything but vertigo. 

   Dressed in golden pantaloons, Simone Alaimo was quite a swaggering sultan, even if his coloratura technique wasn't nearly as polished as the teeth he flashed so menacingly at one point that a retainer fell down in dazzled dread. (Sonja Frisell's direction had some inspired moments.) 
I myself cowered whenever Marilyn Horne appeared on stage as the Venetian hero, Calbo, all decked out in a plumed helmet and large blanket that suggested a crossing of a Valkyrie and a horse. 
She didn't sound any better than she looked. 
The end of her convoluted aria was a happy moment. 

   With the fleet-voiced Chris Merritt stuck in the small role of the foolish governor, June Anderson pretty much had the evening to herself, as Anna, a grim Venetian maiden who commits suicide in a taxing 30-minute scene with a pensive prayer and coloratura finale that left no doubt that the American soprano has few rivals in the high-note-studded bel canto repertoire. 
Pure of voice, physically graceful, she made this impossible character come alive, though even she could not work the miracle of rousing the conductor, Alberto Zedda. 
This was another long evening. 
Listeners bolting for the SFO's bar and buffet broke the sprinting records set the night before at "L'Africaine."

   Opera star Placido Domingo wowed the fans
watching celebrities arrive for the glittering opening of San
Francisco's 66th formal opera season.
   ``I could have fainted dead away,'' said Dr. Lisa Snow of
Berkeley, as Domingo walked by wearing a tuxedo jacket over blue
jeans. ``He's so wonderful ... not stuck up at all.''
   Domingo starred with Shirley Verrett in a 3{-hour performance
Friday night of Meyerbeer's 19th century romance, ``L'Africaine.''
   The San Francisco Chronicle applauded the stars' passionate
performances, but questioned the ``improbable'' choice of the opera
for the opener. It is the story of the love of a presumed African
woman for Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama. At the end, she turns
out to be an East Indian queen.
   But for those unwilling to pay the opening night ticket prices,
ranging from standing room at $15 to $350 for a box seat, the show
was outside.
   Some 100 people _ including one who brought along a 10-foot
python for company _ lined the street outside the Opera House to
watch the arrival of men in black tie and tails and jeweled women
in $10,000 gowns.
   ``Isn't this an evening,'' marveled longtime first-nighter John
McGuire.
   Among those entering the Opera House were Gordon and Ann Getty,
heiress Patricia Hearst Shaw and designer Paloma Picasso.
   People who bought standing room tickets started lining up early
in the day.
   Ingrid Sumeri and seven friends among the standees marched into
the Opera Hall, across from City Hall, to party in the lobby before
the show.
   ``This is our third opening,'' she said. ``We always bring a
picnic and have dinner _ cold salmon, baklava, champagne, lots of
good things.''
   After they entered, the big-money crowd arrived after pre-opera
parties that included a museum supper at $175 a head, and the Opera
Guild's ball, in a large white tent, at $400 each. New York jeweler
Stan Silberstein was on hand for the guild's 5 p.m. bash.
   ``There isn't anything I could think of in New York that would
be a reason to be in black tie in the afternoon,'' he said.

<F P=106> [Address by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at a </F>
banquet held in honor of the visiting presidents of Mali, 
Burkina Faso, and Niger in Tripoli on 16 June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God. I warmly welcome our 
brothers and neighbors, the leaders of the African-Muslim 
countries: Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso in the same manner as 
we welcomed our friend Museveni, the Ugandan president, and 
before him our brother Deby, the president of Chad. 
  The Libyan people welcome and appreciate such solidarity 
from 
their brothers because it will consolidate the Libyan people's 
position in its confrontation with the conspiracy led by three 
colonialist-Western countries. [passage omitted] 
  The Libyan people feels comfortable after the effort it 
extended to the neighboring fraternal peoples and deems that the 
patriots have assumed power in these countries and the agents 
have fallen. 
  The Libyan people has undertaken numerous responsibilities 
toward these peoples. The victory of the will of the peoples of 
Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Chad, and the consolidation of 
freedom and democracy....[pauses] On the other hand, from the 
viewpoint of the Western imperialist countries, what the Libyan 
people were doing was considered support for international 
terrorism, and considered the training camps for those leaders 
and peoples, who were carrying out a liberation war, as 
terrorist camps. This pretext has now been exposed, and this 
Western propaganda, which they used so frequently in the 
aggression against Libya, has fallen. But, it seems that the 
colonialists will not let the Third World achieve stability and 
build itself in order to progress. 
  After these national movements won in these countries, we 
see 
that the colonialist countries work toward creating trouble and 
problems for them. The material evidence that condemn the 
countries of Western colonialism are obvious. They accuse us of 
all untrue accusations and refuse to be confronted with the 
facts that condemn them. Regrettably, this will not lead to an 
understanding between us. 
  We all know that these peoples now, in Niger, Burkina Faso, 
and Mali, who aspire for stability and construction, are today 
the target of a new plot. The role of the old type of 
colonialism has been concretely confirmed. This implicit and 
flagrant interference in the domestic affairs of these peoples 
contradicts the statements and declarations made by these 
countries. 
  In the past they accused Libya of being behind the 
destabilization of African states. Yet, it transpired that 
Libya was behind the cause of liberation and people's democracy. 
Now, the very states who used to accuse Libya are the ones who 
are trying fervently to destabilize the African continent. 
  These are inhuman ethics and a flagrant injustice. The 
Western states are constantly pursuing these states; they are 
trying to sow instability in them; they deny them a chance to 
prove themselves. Psychologically speaking, we feel as if we are 
facing groups who are enemies of humanity. We are facing a 
mentality used to arrogance and the enslavement of others. This 
is not an accusation, but a reality. 
  Who on earth can belittle a person who happens to have a 
black skin? Who in the world introduced the words racial 
discrimination to the dictionary? They are the Western 
colonialist states. 
  Regrettably, we are facing peoples who are defying the whole 
of mankind. We are in confrontation against arrogant states, 
who impose their wrath against us; they use a veto against our 
future. When we raise our voice and resist, they accuse us of 
being warmongers, and against peace. 
  What kind of peace are they talking about? They are talking 
about surrender and that Third World people should surrender 
without making a stand. We have decided, nonetheless, to 
resist. A fact that they must understand. 
  Africa should not be destined to face poverty and misery 
until doomsday merely because of its skin, which was God's 
creation. They have begun a new flagrant interference. 
Regrettably they have meddled with the United Nations, which 
used to be the refuge of peoples seeking peace and protection. 
They have torn up the UN Charter. They had no right to tear up 
a charter that was written by the people. 
  They have trodden on international law; they have no right 
to 
do so. It is an international law and not an internal one. 
They have been using the United Nations for a purpose 
completely different from the one that was intended for it. 
They are using the United Nations as a vehicle for 
neo-colonialism. 
  Before, they used the League of Nations to impose their 
protectorate on the colonized Third World countries. As soon as 
they fiddled with it the League of Nations fell. 
  Today, the Western powers are accused of working seriously 
for the fall of the United Nations. The best proof is the fact 
that they have been using the United Nations for their 
manipulation; they have transformed it into an instrument in 
their hands. They have trodden on its charter. 
  Today, they are carrying out their own work in the name of 
the United Nations. They are using the United Nations outside 
its Charter. Thus, they have decided to kill the United 
Nations. This attitude is a serious one that can be very 
harmful to people of the world. This means that we will face a 
new form of chaos. The world will be transformed into a jungle; 
and the Western states will be responsible for the outcome. 
  What is happening these days in a number of Third World 
countries is clear proof of what I have just said. They believe 
that the Third World is made up of children and duped people; 
this is in addition to their inferior attitude toward Africa; 
they think that the African people are mere gorillas living in a 
jungle; they do not believe that the inhabitants of Africa are 
human beings. Even Dr. Barnard, the heart surgeon who succeeded 
in performing the first heart transplant operation used to hold 
this way of thinking; i.e., black people are not human beings, 
consequently, one should carry out tests on them unreservedly. 
Consequently, he carried out numerous tests on black people, 
like the test performed in the West on mice and rabbits. 
  After having killed a large number of people and destroyed 
their hearts, he succeeded in perfecting the right heart 
transplant technique. All this stems from their attitude of 
inferiority toward the black race. They think that we do not 
understand this. 
  Their behavior is aimed at undermining our will, our desire 
to live, and our right to our land. Now, they are interfering 
in the internal affairs of every state; they believe that we are 
children and duped to the extent that they create problems, then 
they claim that they have to send military forces to solve these 
problems. 
  We are aware that they are the ones who created these 
problems so that they have a pretext to intervene and solve 
them; they think that we are naive and ignorant and imbeciles to 
be fooled by this game. Their mentality is still that of Vasco 
de Gama; they think that Africa still resembles the one 
discovered by Vasco de Gama when he gave Africans shells and 
beads and took raw material and land in return. All Western 
states are like Vasco de Gama; they share the same mentality as 
that of Vasco de Gama; they still perceive and consider us as 
the same people who were discovered by Vasco de Gama. These are 
the matters that incite revolution, and force us to accept the 
challenge. Why do they not leave Mali alone, and stop their 
interference? They should let this poor country rebuild itself 
and live. Why do they not leave Niger and Chad alone? All the 
suffering of these countries is due to this policy. 
  They must understand that while we meet at this level we are 
fully aware of their conspiracies. It is our right to fight and 
we have decided to fight so that they respect us and recognize 
that we are people like them, at least like them, even if we 
believe that we are better than them because we do not commit 
the acts they are committing. Therefore, our mentality is more 
noble than theirs. We do not have the mentality of absurdity, 
human disdain, race, and color segregation. They take pleasure 
in the suffering of the African peoples and laugh at the 
backwardness of the African that they imposed on them in the 
first place. 
  They consider Africa as a jungle, a place for hunting, a 
source for raw materials, and a garden where you can pick 
fruits, but they consider its inhabitants as gorillas. Thus is 
the Western culture that led to colonialism, and world wars, and 
it is the one we are facing nowadays under various names. 
  In Libya, they confronted us in the Gulf of Sirte. When the 
world condemned them and this problem was over, they invented a 
problem called al-Rabitah. When it became clear that al-Rabitah 
was a pharmaceutical plant, and the world condemned them and 
showed solidarity with Libya, they created the so-called 
Lockerbie issue. 
  In this context, the Libyan people hails your stance during 
the OAU [Organization of African Unity] summit meeting. The 
Libyan people hails its brothers and neighbors, as well as all 
the African leaders who stood with the Libyan people. 
  The world condemned them in the Gulf of Sirte and al-Rabitah 
cases, and is now condemning them in the Lockerbie case. 
Despite all this, we hear astonishing things. They say that 
Libya is defying the international community. Who is defying 
the international community? 
  For them, the international community means the Western 
colonialist countries. As for the others, they are not at the 
level of the international community. 
  The conspiratorial memorandum handed by the United States, 
France, and Britain to the United Nations was considered as the 
will of the international community. They ignore the will of 
Africa. 
  What do they have to say about the OAU summit meeting held 
yesterday in Tunis that expressed support to Libya and the 
proposals it made. Are the African countries considered out of 
the international community? 
  The Nonaligned Movement expressed support for Libya, the ICO 
[Islamic Conference Organization] expressed support for Libya. 
The Arab League expressed support for Libya. The OAU adopted 
the Arab League resolution, in addition to the peoples, groups, 
parties, and organizations throughout the whole world. Despite 
all this, should we listen to them tomorrow, we will hear the 
same broken record: Libya is defying the will of the 
international community. In fact, they are the ones who are 
isolated. They are the ones who are isolated by the will of the 
international community. This will is now on the Libyan side. 
The international community is now expressing full support and 
sympathy for Libya, and condemns the three Western countries. 
  Despite all this, we can still hear insolent statements full 
of disdain to the international community. This is the stubborn 
mentality that we are facing. 
  We recently heard that a Palestinian person admitted 
responsibility for causing the explosion of the Pan Am aircraft. 
He made this confession before a court. The day after, the 
West denied this confession. The world was shocked. How could 
this happen? Yesterday, we were looking for whoever was behind 
the Pan Am explosion. 
  We say to the world: Do not be surprised, for the reason is 
very simple. This Palestinian is poor. He does not have 
millions to compensate the families of the victims. Therefore, 
how could one charge him for this act? Libya, however, is rich. 
It can pay damages. So, one must accuse it. 
  This is the reason the world has been laughing at this: How 
can one admit [responsibility for this act] only to hear the 
West tell him: No, no, it is not you. 
  As long as the issue is one of compensation, and so that 
Libya rids the world of this problem and prevents respectable 
presidents coming all the way from their countries to Libya on 
foot [as heard], because of this unjust resolution....[pauses] 
  The world is tired of all the fuss made about Libya. The 
embargo on Libya has ruined many countries and even the West has 
lost out because it is stupid. In order to rid the world of 
this problem, since the issue is about compensation, Libya does 
not object to the creation of a compensation fund, for this 
would be a humanitarian action. This fund would be used to 
compensate the victims' families, including those of Lockerbie, 
just for the sake of the world and in order to rid the world of 
this tension. There are families of Libyan victims who were 
killed by America and Britain. However, the Libyans are perhaps 
rich and may not need any compensation. There are also Iranian 
families whose relatives were killed by America when the U.S. 
Navy shot down the civilian aircraft aboard which they were 
flying. It could be that Iran is rich and would not want any 
compensation. 
  There are also the victims of the Italian airliner shot down 
by the U.S. fleet over Ustica. There are the Lockerbie victims 
and maybe the Americans and the British are poor and would like 
damages. We do not object to the creation of a compensation 
fund; and let us erase the confessions of that Palestinian and 
let us tell him: Keep quiet, we know that you carried out the 
Pan Am operation but you have not got any money. This is a good 
solution. 
  The Libyan people are once again, I believe, doubly happy. 
Once because their efforts with the neighboring and sister 
states would not have been wasted. Nationalist regimes were 
established in Egypt [as heard], Sudan, Chad, Niger, Mali, and 
Tunisia. Nationalist regimes and popular regimes dear to Libya 
were established in these countries. These efforts were 
considered as aimed at destabilizing Africa and were regarded as 
terrorism, but the result was the triumph of the nationalist 
regimes. 
  When we were working against the lackey regimes they told 
us: 
You were destabilizing Africa. Now we have united with 
nationalist regimes they tell us: This is unity, you have 
imperial ambitions. They have been stubbornly against us in both 
cases. [passage omitted] 
  I have one remark to make before I conclude my speech, it is 
about our sisterly Rwanda. I would like to draw your attention 
to the fact that this is not the first catastrophe that has 
shaken Rwanda. We still remember with sadness and bitterness 
the tragic massacres of 1959 and 1973. Today we are witnessing 
fresh massacres. I am afraid that such ugly massacres will be 
repeated. We should, therefore, accept the bad in order to avoid 
the worse. 
  We are aware that the Tutsi tribes immigrated to this region 
hundreds of years ago. They might have come from Arab 
countries. Problems began to emerge between the original people 
and those coming from outside. Like between Palestinians and 
Israelis and whites and blacks in South Africa. The situation 
in Rwanda is, however, a particular one and should not be taken 
as an example for other countries. 
  Regrettably, the solution I am about to propose is a bad 
one, 
but it is better than the worse. If we want to stop the 
massacres and prevent their recurrence forever, we must separate 
the two races, the Tutsi and the Hutu. 
  What is now called the National Front is in fact the 
frontier 
of the Tutsis, and the so-called government is for the Hutus. 
International forces should now separate the two sides. The 
separation should be final between them. In fact, this is the 
only solution to prevent these tragedies from recurring. 
  Dear brothers, I thank you for this visit and this meeting 
that provided us with an opportunity to talk about these 
important issues, which we discussed today and yesterday. 
  I once more welcome you in your country and among your 
kinsfolk. We are your natural ally, and you can rely on this 
ally which will never disappoint you. The struggle continues.

<F P=106> [Article: "PF Seizes 51 Kilos of Cocaine Paste"] </F>
  [Text] The Federal District Regional Superintendency of the 
Federal Police Department [DPF] yesterday reported the results 
of the work done by the Drug Enforcement Headquarters to seize 
51 kg of coca base and a number of packages of the starch that 
is used to adulterate--"step on"--the drug. Adulteration 
increases the weight of the drug and, consequently, its value. 
The seizure took place on the ranch owned by trafficker Antonio 
Alde Paiva ("Chimarrao"), who got away. The ranch is located 
near the municipality of Santo Antonio do Descoberto in Goias. 
Three traffickers were arrested. 
  Investigation of the trafficker intensified when Federal 
Police agents obtained information that Antonio Alves--a 
trafficker well known to the DPF--would be receiving a large 
shipment of cocaine from Bolivia. The Federal Police discovered 
that "Chimarrao" owned some rural property in the municipality 
of Santo Antonio do Descoberto on the banks of the Areias River 
and that the drugs would probably be hidden there. By 
maintaining surveillance on the trafficker, police were able to 
dismantle part of that drug connection by arresting three 
members of the gang. 
  During their investigation, the Federal Police learned that 
"Chimarrao" had frequent contacts in Goiania, Cuiaba, and 
Abadiania in Goias. It was discovered that Edison de Abreu Gama, 
Agenor Jose Alves, and Jose Lima Rodrigues had arrived in 
Abadiania with some large casks, and that was when the Federal 
Police Superintendency in the Federal District decided to start 
its operation. 
  Arrest--The DPF agents arrested Edison de Abreu Gama, Agenor 
Jose Alves, and Jose Lima Rodrigues at Kilometer 13 on Highway 
BR-060. They were in a white Niva automobile with Sao Paulo 
license number SZ-4772. Found in the vehicle were a radio 
communications set and a .38 caliber revolver. The three men 
confessed that they had left the drugs on the side of Highway 
BR-060 near Abadiania, the place where they had been the night 
before. 
  Carrying a search and arrest warrant and aided by 
drug-sniffing dogs, the federal agents were able to seize not 
only the drugs but also three shotguns, eight cartridges, and a 
number of blank documents--dummies for printing--belonging to 
the Federal District Traffic Department. The seizure occurred at 
the home of "Chimarrao," who owns the ranch alongside Highway 
BR-060. 
  After the drugs were seized, Agenor confessed that his job 
in 
the gang was to accompany a truck driver named Mauro to the town 
of Abadiania and that the drugs were taken from a false bottom 
in the fuel tank of a truck--the license number of which is 
being kept secret by the Federal Police so as not to jeopardize 
the rest of the investigation that is now under way. Agenor also 
said that seven days earlier, he had brought 35 kg of coca base 
to "Chimarrao," who is a now a fugitive. 
  Edison de Abreu Gama was the escort while the drug was being 
transported--that is, he drove ahead of the truck in the car 
with the radio set so as to warn truck driver Mauro of possible 
problems. The gang members were arrested and are being held at 
the DPF jail in the Federal District, where they have been 
charged with the commission of a crime under Article 12 of Law 
No. 6368.

Premier Li may be forgiven for thinking that the local press has it in for
him. In the Portuguese colony of Macao, hacks have just landed an
uncomfortable exclusive, c/o the office of General Vasco Rocha Vieira, the
governor.
His officials have compiled a profile of Li, describing him as arrogant and
incompetent. Of course, it was intended for the general only. But you can't
keep a grubby hack down.
Very poor show, not least because the general is now on an eight-day
official trip to China, where today he will meet Li. Even more poor show,
Macao - a Portuguese colony since 1557 - is due to revert to Chinese rule in
1999.
Still, five years should be enough for the general to find himself another
job.

FT  26 APR 93 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (6):
Novelty of a network in insurance / Profile of Banco Mello
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH PROVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWLY-created Banco Mello is one of Portugal's smaller banks but its owners
believe it is poised to make an important impact on the financial sector.
The family bank has two major factors in its favour - it belongs to the
financially- astute Mello family and is being developed hand-in-hand with
the clan's other big asset, Portugal's top insurance company, Imperio.
'When we acquired the bank in May 1991, it was nothing more than a bank with
a licence and a team of people,' says Mr Vasco de Mello, the bank's
36-year-old president. 'We implemented a new strategy. 'We decided it was
important to change the bank's name - it was called Sociedade Financeira
Portuguesa - and adapt to a new culture,' he says. 'We wanted to be a market
player in corporate business, in personal business and in the capital
markets.'
One of Portugal's leading financial families before 1974, the Mellos saw a
left-wing revolution whittle away most of their wealth through
nationalisation. Mr Jose Manuel de Mello was one of the country's leading
businessmen in pre- revolutionary Portugal, controlling the largest economic
group, Companhia Uniao Fabril, which had interests in shipping, banking and
insurance.
The family dispersed after the 1974 coup and headed for more
financially-sound centres such as New York, London and Switzerland. But they
never quite turned their backs on their homeland.
Today, with a stable democratic government in office, the Mello family has
returned in force. The govern- ment, embracing capitalist ideals and a free
market ideology, has helped pave the way for their comeback. Through his
personal holding company, Uniao Internacional Financeira, the family
patriarch Mr Jose Manuel de Mello regained more than 90 per cent of SFP
shares when the institution was reprivatised in May 1991.
SFP, granted the status of a special investment company, was originally
created in 1969 by the former right-wing dictatorship as a public limited
company, mainly as a vehicle to support industrial and development projects
in Portugal and its African colonies, particularly Angola and Mozambique.
The group changed the name to Banco de Mello six months after the purchase.
Last November, Mr Jose Manuel further tightened his grip on Portugal's
financial world by regaining control of the country's largest insurance
company, Imperio, buying a 65.55 per cent stake at its reprivatisation.
For the past two years, the reorganisation of the Jose de Mello Group has
centred round the fledgling Banco Mello. Today the bank with a 204-strong
workforce has graduated from a small to a medium-sized institution and is
ready to climb further. The Mello family plans to use the already
established Imperio network, with its 700,000 clients and 80 branches, to
expand throughout the country, initially focusing on Lisbon and Oporto. 'The
main difference is in the concept of banking,' Mr Vasco de Mello explains.
'We aim to distribute in other ways rather than act like a traditional bank.
'Imperio changes our way forward dramatically,' he says. 'We plan to do the
opposite from other banks by devel- oping banking products to add to a
distribution network already there. It has a certain novelty - insurance
contributing a network for a bank.'
Mr Vasco de Mello, the eldest son of shipping tycoon Mr Jose Manuel de
Mello, says that there are clear similarities between Imperio and the bank
and the family decided it was possible to develop a joint distribution
network, using the physical facilities of Imperio, to get closer to a more
personal market.
Banco Mello, still the child of the financial sector of the Jose de Mello
Group, is just one aspect of an integrated group which is organised into
three main financial fields: banking, insurance and investment management.
The bank's cash flow for 1992 increased 14.8 per cent to Es1.9bn (Pounds
8.32m), while net assets jumped 72 per cent to Es92.4bn. However, owing to
large investments, mainly in personnel and information technology, net
profits were slightly down.
The group hopes to open three more branches by the end of June, with an
additional nine six months later. By the end of 1994 Banco Mello is expected
to have opened facilities in all Imperio branches.
Although banking comp- etition is intensifying and economic activity has
slowed, the group is positive about the development of the bank. It has the
advantage of knowing that Portugal's insurance market is expected to show
the biggest growth rates in the EC this year.
In 1992, Imperio remained the leading insurance company with a total market
share of 12.9 per cent. Net profits were up 8.2 per cent to Es690m while
cash flow increased 43 per cent to Es2.6bn. The group is moving into
chemical companies and shipping, as well as maintaining its presence in
financial services through Banco Mello and Imperio.
'History doesn't repeat itself, but there are opportunities,' says Mr Vasco
de Mello. 'We're just trying to develop those opportunities.'

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] There are no ideological differences 
within the Socialist Party (PS), wrote Orlando Raimundo in the 
21 May Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, but only different roads to 
power. The "saga" of the PS, which has already "sacrificed" two 
secretaries general--Vitor Constancio and Jorge Sampaio--is 
permanently marked by a lack of faith in the leader, Raimundo 
continued, fomented by a president [Mario Soares] who "insists 
that everything be done his way." Besides his own--mostly 
young--allies, PS leader Antonio Guterres seems to have only 
poll results on his side. Were Guterres to lose the 12 June 
European Parliament elections, hostilities would immediately 
begin, centering on how to bring about Prime Minister Cavaco 
Silva's downfall, the socialists' "great obsession" in recent 
years, Raimundo contended. However, if the PS wins, victory 
would be "devalued" and Guterres would only get, once again, 
"the benefit of the doubt." Meanwhile, Raimundo continued, 
various party officials are waiting in the background to decide 
about reentering the scene. 
  According to Raimundo, the PS's "hard core" is formed by 
Guterres partisans who throw themselves wholeheartedly in the 
struggle to prove the validity of their strategy, which aims at 
removing the PS's leftist stigma and waiting for disillusioned 
"Cavacoists" to join them. Their rallying point is the clash 
with President Soares. The group includes Antonio Vitorino, who 
heads the PS list for the Euroelections, Jorge Coelho, Jose 
Lamego, Arons de Carvalho, and Jorge Lacao. 
  The group around former Minister of Defense Jaime Gama 
includes Eduardo Pereira, Jose Lello, and Miranda Calha. Absent 
in recent years from the political debate because of their 
leader's "desertion," they are attempting a comeback by 
supporting Gama as an alternative to Guterres. While Gama seems 
to be a "born loser," he still wields a measure of influence, 
according to Raimundo. 
  The Sampaio group--Joao Cravinho, Alberto Martins, Antonio 
Costa, Lopes Cardoso, and Ferro Rodrigues--aims at ensuring 
Sampaio's candidacy for the presidency and reunifying the Left. 
Like President Soares, they want internal diversity and a 
plurality of opinions. 
  Betting on the values of humanism and of the Left, the 
Soares 
group, formed by Almeida Santos, Manuel Alegre, and Antonio 
Campos "cannot reconcile itself with the `tragedy' of a country 
governed by the Right," but lacks a strategy and an alternative 
to Guterres. 
  Porto Mayor Fernando Gomes "runs on his own track," keeps 
intact his presidential ambitions, and is best placed to succeed 
Guterres, according to Raimundo, despite his trumpeted 
solidarity with the PS leader. 
  The "free" group, which includes PS official Joao Soares, 
former General Workers Union (UGT) leader Torres Couto, and PS 
luminary Vitor Constancio, is awaiting electoral results to 
decide its future course.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Southern Africa eyes prize of peace: As Mozambique and
Angola edge warily toward a lasting peace, Michael Holman, Nicholas Shaxton
and Peter Stanley assess the likely impact on the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, NICHOLAS SHAXTON and PETER STANLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the 60m people of southern Africa were capable of collectively crossing
their fingers, and uttering a silent prayer, they would be doing so this
week.
The outcome of Mozambique's elections and Angola's peace talks will
determine whether the region can, for the first time in three decades,
secure peace.
Here, in the two countries where the old southern Africa was born some 400
years ago, the final stages in the shaping of the new southern Africa are
taking place.
It was on the coasts of Angola and Mozambique that the Portuguese seafarers
Vasco da Gama and Bartolomeu Dias laid claim to an African empire which was
to last until 1974. That year the foundations of white rule began to crack,
for the coup in Lisbon in 1974 not only paved the way to independence for
Portugal's African colonies, it marked the beginning of the end for minority
regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. The days ahead now see the final phase
of that process, which has been hastened by the collapse of communism and
the end of superpower rivalries.
In Mozambique, 6.5m voters go to the polls tomorrow and Friday in the
country's first multi-party elections. If they proceed without mishap, the
country can begin to develop an economy shattered by civil conflict and
external aggression.
In Angola, talks aimed at bringing an end to the civil war may be within
reach of success, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations
secretary-general.
Should Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader who forced the collapse of the
1991 settlement when he refused to accept his defeat by President Eduardo
dos Santos in the election the following year, agree to the terms negotiated
over the past nine months in the Zambian capital Lusaka, the last piece of
the regional settlement falls into place.
And if both Mozambique and Angola manage to secure a lasting peace in the
critical days ahead, it would mark a watershed for the region, led today by
newly democratic South Africa.
Free of racial division and civil war, without external aggressors, and
accepting the principles of democracy and civil rights, and with market
driven economic planning, southern Africa will have a common cause: to
develop the potential of lands rich in oil and natural gas, minerals, marine
resources and agricultural produce, with the bonus of thousands of miles of
fine beaches encompassing Af-rica's finest wildlife res-erves.
But although the foundations of the new region are in place, much can yet go
wrong before the edifice is finally complete.
In Mozambique Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the erstwhile rebel Renamo party
and the main challenger to President Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo
party, seems to be hinting that he, like Mr Savimbi, might not accept defeat
at the polls.
Meanwhile peace may yet prove elusive in Angola, notwithstanding the
optimism of Mr Boutros Ghali, who in his report to the Security Council said
that 'the peace talks are now in their final phase'.
The collapse of Angola's transition to democracy is fresh in the minds of
the Mozambique electorate. Mr Chissano, whose party has ruled Mozambique
since independence, is widely expected to win, but made clear that Mr
Dhlakama would be part of a coalition government only on his terms,
unconditionally accepting Frelimo policies.
The differences between the two parties are not ideological, however, but
stem from regional, ethnic and personal rivalries.
'First we are asking whether Mr Dhlakama will accept my programme with no
preconditions,' said the president. 'I think it is necessary to have
opposition, but in parliament, not in the administration. . . Renamo is not
an opposition in ideological terms.'
Some observers suspect that Mr Dhlakama is preparing the way for a return to
the bush war. He has repeated recent warnings that Renamo would not tolerate
electoral fraud in the presidential and parliamentary polls.
Unlike Angola, however, the integration of rival armies is more advanced and
the UN monitoring force is 7,000 strong - nearly 10 times the Angola
contingent - and is backed by 2,400 international observers.
Both sides, however, are thought to have substantial arms caches and to have
kept back soldiers in reserve. Whichever party wins the elections, only a
coalition government can effectively tackle the legacy of 400 years of
colonialism and 30 years of war.
Meanwhile in Angola the UN secretary-general's optimism is not shared by the
people in Luanda.
'If the two sides show the necessary political will, the outstanding issues
can be resolved within a short time', Mr Boutros Ghali said recently, and
urged the Angolan government and Unita to conclude the peace talks by
October 31.
Should a final deal be struck, it would involve a revival of the 1991
accords. But the collapse of the transition in late 1992 inspired new
hatreds.
The Unita fighters used hidden weapons stockpiles rapidly to capture much of
Angola's territory, while in the main towns and cities MPLA vigilante groups
hunted down and killed Unita supporters.
The renewed distrust will make disarmament of both sides, envisaged under
the new peace plan, a difficult exercise.
The two sides do agree that Angola needs a UN force at least 6,000 strong to
oversee a ceasefire. Both government and Unita officials are doubtful,
however, about the world's willingness to pay for an exercise on this scale
and provide the manpower required.
Without a settlement, the conflict seems set to drag on as neither side is
likely to win the war. Unita is able to make much of the countryside
ungovernable, but is unable to capture MPLA urban strongholds.
Neither side seems short of funds. For the government, proceeds come from
more than 500,000 barrels of oil that flow daily from mainly offshore
oilfields. For Unita, an estimated Dollars 250m (Pounds 158.2m) worth of
diamonds have been leaked out from its territory, which includes the main
diamond producing areas.
Generals and politicians on both sides openly recognise that the war is
unwinnable. And the size of the prize at stake is so great that they know
they will not readily be forgiven if they squander the opportunity for
peace.
Angola is in the fortunate position of being able to fund its recover by
using the oil and diamond wealth that currently funds the war, and take part
in the wider reconstruction of the region. For the first time southern
Africa is attracting the attention of emerging market funds, thanks both to
political change in South Africa and economic reforms across the continent.
Although the bulk of the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn the market might attract
will go to South Africa, nearly a dozen stock markets are now competing for
business - in Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Namibia,
Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Traditional obstacles to investment
 -ranging from artificially fixed exchange rates and exchange controls to
government hostility - are being eased or removed altogether.
For the first time in 400 years, the region will be free of systems of
racially based hegemony, free of conflict, free of the ideological
differences that marked the post independence era of Africa, and able to
harness the power of South Africa.
If Mozambique and Angola succeed in their transition to lasting democracy,
the people of southern Africa may be able to look back on the days ahead as
the start of a new and more prosperous era.
 --------------------------------------------------------
      THE EVENTS THAT SHAPED A NEW SOUTHERN AFRICA
 --------------------------------------------------------
1974  Portugal's dictatorship ousted.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1975  Portugal cedes independence to colonies, including
      Angola and Mozambique, where guerrilla wars began
      in early 1960s.  Portuguese flee, and civil wars
      break out.  South African troops invade Angola;
      Cuba begins troop build-up.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1976  Mozambique closes border with Rhodesia, where white
      minority had unilaterally declared independence
      from Britain in 1965.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1976  Guerrilla war in Rhodesia escalates as forces led
      by Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo infiltrate from
      bases in Mozambique and Zambia.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1979  Lancaster House settlement on Rhodesia paves way
      for the independent state of Zimbabwe; elections
      in 1980 won by Mugabe's Zanu party.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1988  US-brokered deal secures independence for Namibia
      from South Africa in return for Cuban troop
      withdrawal from neighbouring Angola.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1989  Sam Nujoma, leader of South West Africa People's
      Organisation, wins Namibia's independence election.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1990  South Africa releases long-imprisoned black
      nationalist leader Nelson Mandela
 --------------------------------------------------------
1991  Ceasefire in Angola civil war.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1992  Angolan elections confirm President Eduardo dos
      Santos' MPLA in power, but opposition Unita leader
      Jonas Savimbi refuses to accept outcome.  Civil
      war resumes.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1992  Ceasefire in Mozambique civil war.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1994  Mandela's African National Congress wins first
      all-race elections in South Africa.
 --------------------------------------------------------
                         ANGOLA
 --------------------------------------------------------
The 1974 military takeover in Portugal brought Angolan
independence the following year but not peace.  Civil
war continuedm exacerbated by South African invasions
and the arrival of Cuban troops.  A ceasefire resulted
in elections in 1992, with the ruling MPLA defeating
the opposing Unita movement.  Unita refused to accept
the outcome; war resumed.  Now, peace talks may be
close to success.
 --------------------------------------------------------
                        NAMIBIA
 --------------------------------------------------------
A 1988, US-brokered settlement saw the withdrawal of
Cuban troops from Angola in return for South African
acceptance of multi-party elections in Namibia.  These
took place in the following year and were won by the
South West Africa People's Organisation, which is still
in power.
 --------------------------------------------------------
                       ZIMBABWE
 --------------------------------------------------------
Once the fiefdom of the British South Africa Company,
the territory (then Rhodesia) became a British colony
at the turn of this century.  The settlers won self
government in 1923, unilaterally declared independence
in 1965, but bowed to sanctions and guerrilla war in 1979.
In 1980 elections, the Zanu party came to power, where
it stays today in partnership with the Zapu party.
 --------------------------------------------------------
                      MOZAMBIQUE
 --------------------------------------------------------
As in Angola, independence in 1975 was traumatic, marked
by the exodus of more than 200,000 settlers of Portuguese
origin and a civil war encouraged first by white
Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and then by white South Africa.
A 1992 peace pact brought the war to an end.  This
Thursday and Friday, 6.5m voters go to the polls in the
country's first multi-party elections.
 --------------------------------------------------------
                    SOUTH AFRICA
 --------------------------------------------------------
More than 350 years after Dutch explorer Jan van Riebeeck
founded a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope, white rule
and its apartheid racial policies finally gave way in the
face of sanctions and domestic opposition with the
release from prison in 1990 of Nelson Mandela.  He was
elected president of South Africa this year in the
country's first all-race elections.

basement of a Zurich bookshop in the early 1960s, the former Caltech professor 
heard what sounded like a huge rat gnawing at a book. 
</P>
<P>
He peered cautiously into the next aisle. And there was his old pal Nnamdi 
Azikwe, then-president of Nigeria, also on his hands and knees, gazing intently 
at contents on the dusty lower shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"He, too, knew that hit-and-miss collectors will often . . . leave the real 
gems unmined on the less-convenient lower shelves," Munger recalled. 
</P>
<P>
It took Munger more than four decades of haunting bookstores on six continents 
to build up a collection of 45,000 volumes on Africa, the largest such private 
library in the United States, says Moore Crossey, curator of the African 
Collection at Yale University's library. 
</P>
<P>
But the professor retired last year and Caltech, which housed the books, says 
it can no longer accommodate his library. Neither can Munger, whose Pasadena 
home will hold only a fraction of his collection. 
</P>
<P>
So Munger, 67, has been forced to break up what many scholars have called a 
unique cultural resource. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was invaluable," said Richard L. Sklar, a professor of political 
science at UCLA and former president of the Atlanta-based national African 
Studies Assn. "I'm so sorry to hear it's being broken up. So many scholars have 
used it from all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
At first Munger had hoped to sell his library in one piece, but many 
universities already owned some tomes and didn't want to duplicate their 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
He donated about 8,900 books to Caltech. Several hundred more were sold at a 
discount to Occidental College and Pasadena City College. Others were purchased 
by antiquarian book dealers in far-flung places like Sydney, Australia, and 
Johannesburg, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is down to one-quarter of his original collection. Another 1,000 of his 
rarest books will go on the auction block beginning todayat Sotheby's in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Munger did not reveal how much the books have sold for, but he noted that one 
bookseller said the estimated worth of the entire collection "probably 
approaches seven figures." 
</P>
<P>
Munger says he has few regrets about breaking up his collection. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like when a child grows up and goes to college; it's a part of life," 
says Munger, who hopes his 45,000 "children" will all find good homes. 
</P>
<P>
One of Munger's most prized possessions is a scrap of paper that bears what the 
professor calls the only known signature of Cetywayo, the last great King of 
the Zulus, who trounced the British in South Africa in 1879, wiping out an 
entire British regiment. 
</P>
<P>
When a later Zulu king visited Munger, and saw the rare signature, "he broke 
into tears" Munger recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Munger's library includes rare political pamphlets written in 1912 by South 
African communists. It also includes first editions of "Cry The Beloved 
Country," by the anti-apartheid South African author Alan Paton, a friend of 
Munger. 
</P>
<P>
It includes 15th-Century illuminated manuscripts on vellum written in Geez, the 
liturgical language of the 
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Coptic Church; there is a letter signed by Dr. David Livingstone 
dated 1861 and a document signed by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, who 
sailed around the Cape of Good Hope to India in the late 1490s, opening the 
first all-water trade route between Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
One collection that Munger didn't snap up was a cache of 200 letters that 
Mahatma Gandhi wrote to an architect friend while living in Durban. At $20,000, 
Munger thought it too pricey. But he often sought out rare publications and 
manuscripts that dealt with the history of the Indian people in Africa, who 
"played an extremely important role in developing the economic history of East 
Africa," Munger says. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1930s, when he was growing up in Chicago, however, Munger didn't 
know Durban from Timbuktu. But he did have a penchant for book collecting, 
often trading candy to neighborhood children in exchange for books. 
</P>
<P>
Some years later, while he was in the Army, Munger showed an aptitude for 
poker. When he hit the jackpot one night in 1947, he took his winnings and 
headed for West Africa -- a place that had long conjured up visions of exotic 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began a lifelong fascination with Africa, one that led eventually to a 
doctorate in political geography from the University of Chicago, a role in 
founding the national African Studies Assn. and a 14-year stint as president of 
the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation, the Pasadena-based organization founded by 
archeologists Louis and Mary Leakey which supports scientific research into the 
origins of man. 
</P>
<P>
While completing his Ph.D and looking for an academic home, Munger realized 
that few libraries in the United States had sizable Africana collections. Bent 
on teaching students about Africa, he decided to build up a collection that 
could both serve as a teaching tool and make him a welcome addition to any 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
When Caltech offered him one of its few humanities professorships in 1959, he 
agreed, so long as he could take along his "laboratory." 
</P>
<P>
During the decades that he taught "The Politics of Africa" to science majors at 
Caltech, Munger's podium served as a revolving door for visiting lecturers that 
included the foreign minister of Tanzania, the president of Gambia, and South 
African critics of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Munger has met just about every important person in recent African 
history, including the noted Nigerian social realist writer Chinua Achebe and 
the notorious tyrant and former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who had been a 
bellboy in a hotel where Munger once stayed in Kampala. Amin, an amateur boxer, 
was so big and brutish that he could knock out two men at once, and proved it 
during fights that the British set up, Munger recalled. 
</P>
<P>
After 76 trips to Africa, Munger concludes that "the people are the most 
exciting in West Africa, the scenery is the most inspiring in East Africa and 
the problems are the most challenging in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Book collecting proved challenging too, an occupation ill-suited for weak-kneed 
bookworms. 
</P>
<P>
Munger says he has been shot at by a Cuban MIG fighter plane in Angola and held 
upside-down over a cliff in Sao Tome -- an island in the South Atlantic -- by 
Portuguese secret police who mistook him for a revolutionary. Another close 
call came in 1960 when the Belgians began pulling out of the Congo (now Zaire). 
Munger was walking down the street with an Israeli colonel in Leopoldville -- 
now Kinshasa -- when, briefly after parting ways, the colonel was shot in the 
head by guerrilla snipers. 
</P>
<P>
Bibliophiles say Munger himself played an important role in African 
scholarship, beginning with his doctoral thesis: a history of Monrovia, the 
capital of Liberia, the African country founded in 1847 by freed U.S. slaves. 
</P>
<P>
Munger's library "has a lot of unique, interesting and very, very scarce 
political material, especially about South Africa," said Crossey, curator of 
Yale's African Collection. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Munger devotes most of his time to the Cape of Good Hope Foundation, a 
Pasadena-based organization he founded in 1984 to provide college educations in 
South Africa to promising poor and underprivileged minority students. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some academics who have enhanced their own collections with Munger's 
books are of two minds about the dismantling of his library. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, it's a pity because it was put together by the vision of one 
individual," said Gerald J. Bender, director of the school of international 
relations at USC. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, "If it's going to be better utilized, then perhaps that should 
be its fate."

<F P=106> [By Harald Bruning in Macao] </F>
  [Text] Portugal's new "state secret law", approved by the 
parliament in Lisbon in February, was gazetted in Macao 
yesterday. Macao's Governor, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, was 
reported to have insisted that the Portuguese law be enforced in 
Macao. 
  According to the law, "documents and pieces of information 
whose knowledge by non-authorised persons is susceptible to 
putting at risk or causing harm to the national independence, 
unity and integrity of the (Portuguese) State and its internal 
and external security" fall under the state secret category. 
  For the first time in Portugal's legal history, the Macao 
Governor as well as the head of state, parliamentary Speaker and 
Prime Minister, has the power to classify on his own initiative 
certain documents and information as state secrets. 
  Civil servants and military personnel in Portugal and Macao 
contravening the state secret law face criminal and disciplinary 
proceedings. 
  The law states that the "protection of classified documents" 
was directed against "acts of sabotage and spying and leaking of 
information". A special parliamentary committee of the Assembly 
of the Republic in Lisbon is to oversee its implementation. 
  Portuguese media reports said Vieira asked last year for the 
right to classify documents in view of the enclave's transition 
towards Chinese rule from 1999. The reports maintained there 
was a need to protect Portuguese "state secrets" in negotiations 
with China over Macao "directly by the Macao Governor and not 
just through Lisbon".

FT  14 MAY 94 / Dreams of leaving Lisbon's slums: Government and council
plan to rehouse all shanty-dwellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sleeping dogs, dead rats and discarded syringes lie along the dirt paths
leading into a forlorn neighbourhood of shanty dwellings and slum houses,
sprawling across a Lisbon hillside in the shadow of a multi-storey shopping
centre, Peter Wise reports from Lisbon.
Young men question outsiders before admitting them to the rows of crumbling
houses and dilapidated shacks made of planks, plastic sheeting and
corrugated iron. The only visitors they expect are the police or drug-takers
looking for supplies.
One long-standing resident, Mrs Maria Leonor, 32, lives here with her family
of seven in a one-room dwelling made by her husband, a street vendor, by
nailing rough pieces of timber to wooden struts. The city council gave them
the boards and nails after a fire destroyed their previous shanty home in
1985.
Mrs Leonor is out of work and has never learnt to read or write. She points
up stone steps strewn with rubbish to the tap where she fetches water. Three
men facing a nearby wall look round furtively as they inject themselves in
the forearms.
This is Casal Ventoso, acknowledged by Portuguese officials as one of the
worst slums in western Europe. Mrs Leonor's home is just one of 38,000
shanty dwellings in Portugal, housing an estimated 43,000 families. Most of
them share one ambition: 'I just want to move out into a home that is safe
for my children,' she says.
Little has been done to alleviate the plight of shanty dwellers since
bairros de lata - 'tin-can quarters' - first appeared in Portugal almost a
century ago. But the centre-right government is now embarking on an
ambitious Es270bn (Pounds 1bn) programme to eradicate shanty towns and
rehouse their occupants before the end of the century.
'The shanties prick at the conscience of the whole nation,' says Mr Joaquim
Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public works, transport and
telecommunications. 'No other country at the same level of development as
Portugal suffers from this shameful problem.'
Under the plan, the government will pay for the construction of new homes
and local authorities, most of which are controlled by the opposition
Socialist party, will administer them and subsidise rents according to the
occupiers' means. Most shanty dwellers pay no rent and low, if any, utility
bills.
Migration from the rural interior to Lisbon and Oporto produced many of the
existing bairros de lata in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the workers who
built Lisbon's April 25 suspension bridge, which opened in 1966, still live
in nearby shanty towns.
Others, like Pedreiro dos Hungaros to the west of Lisbon, are populated by
immigrants from Portugal's former African colonies, mainly the Cape Verde
islands. The atmosphere is more convivial here than in Casal Ventoso, but
conditions are just as bad.
Several factors foment the building of shanty towns. Portugal has no pool of
low-rent, state-owned housing. The private rent market was undermined by a
40-year rent freeze that discouraged owners from renting out properties and
is only now slowly being re-animated. And taxes amounting to more than half
the cost of a house help put buying a home beyond the reach of many low-wage
earners.
More than 5,000 shanty dwellings have been destroyed in Lisbon since a
coalition of Socialists and Communists won control of the city council in
1989. This month, the government and the council agreed on a Es72bn
programme to build 11,129 houses to rehouse all the families in the city
still living in shanty towns.
Most will be moved into apartment buildings. And surveys among residents
dismiss as sentimental myth the opinion that they will miss the open-air
life, vegetable plots, chicken runs and community spirit of the bairros de
lata. 'We're not aware of a single person who would rather stay in a shanty
town than move into a flat,' says Mr Vasco Franco, the Lisbon city
councillor responsible for the rehousing programme.
But Mr Franco fears that the pressures that led to the growth of the shanty
towns will continue and possibly increase. Many construction workers will be
attracted to the capital by an extensive infrastructure programme, including
the building of a new bridge over the Tagus river, the Expo '98
international exhibition and the housing programme itself.
The city council demolishes every new shanty dwelling that appears,
currently at a rate of four of five a day. But other forms of cheap
accommodation are taking their place. 'There are small apartments in Lisbon
where up to 20 people sleep in rows of bunk beds, paying by the night,' says
Mr Franco. 'The only lasting solution to the problem is for the state to
invest in building a large pool of accessibly-priced homes.'

FT  15 MAY 93 / Travel: Africa - my own private tryst list - Michael Holman
discloses the names of special hotels that he trusts for assignations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SULTAN'S band no longer plays outside the English Club in Zanzibar. It
used to, every Thursday evening, according to my guidebook. But that was
published in 1952, when the island was a British protectorate.
Some 30 years later I sat on the balcony of the club and watched the dhows
drift by at sunset. The band stopped playing at independence in December
1963. The club had become the Africa House Hotel, its past revealed by the
battered snooker table and a faded sign pointing to the 'Ladies Powder
Room'.
As in many of my favourite African hotels, ghosts seemed to walk the club's
corridors and prop up the bar. Like the club, the hotels usually have high
ceilings and creaky fans, mosquito nets and wide verandas. The bedroom keys
have worn wooden tags, the cast-iron baths rest on clawed feet, and the bar
has trophies of long-forgotten tournaments.
They are on my idiosyncratic African tryst list: scenes of assignations with
companions real or imagined. Hotels where, by chance or design, I have met
up with a friend; or which were my destination in a search for the past.
Most of them are - or were in their heyday - tourist hotels in the
conventional sense, either set amid spectacular scenery or near man-made
marvels. They still provide hospitality, though many show the strains of the
continent's crisis. But my judgment of their appeal is flawed, distorted by
that narcotic nostalgia, or by the strange juxtapositions of life as a
journalist in Africa. Being a witness to poverty and distress and then
retreating to comfort and security; or simply thankful to have survived a
long car journey or bumpy flight, accentuates the pleasures of the senses.
Never has chablis tasted so good as at the Hotel de la Gare in Lubumbashi,
southern Zaire, in the wake of one the abortive uprisings against President
Mobutu. Nor has my thirst been slaked so well as by the cold beer served on
arrival at the Mweya Safari Lodge, high above Lake Edward in eastern Uganda,
at the end of a fraught and dusty journey from Kampala, not long after Idi
Amin's downfall. Seldom have I enjoyed my Davidoff cigar more than on the
lawn of the hotel at Bahar Dar on the banks of Lake Tana in central
Ethiopia. On the horizon was one of the lake's ancient island monasteries,
some dating back to the 13th century. The monks still observed age-old
rituals of meditation and prayer.
Other unsung wonders of Africa are served by the hotels on my list. War made
some of them well-nigh inaccessible for most visitors. Peace has since
brought them within reach, although they remain hard to get at for all but
the determined visitor, who will have to brave pot-holed roads and endure
rickety aircraft.
The modest hotel in Lalibela, in northern Ethiopia, overlooks a wondrous
spectacle - 12 churches hewn out of solid rock over 800 years ago. From the
Gohar hotel, high in the hills that surround Gondar in north-eastern
Ethiopia, one looks down in the valley with the 17th century castle of
Emperor Fasiladas.
At the window of a dilapidated hotel I watched dawn break over Mozambique
island, where Vasco da Gama's ships cast anchor in 1498. Sunrise revealed a
16th century Portuguese town, transplanted to the east African coast and
frozen in time. It was the capital of Mozambique until the end of the last
century; now it is a crumbling relic of 400 years of colonial rule.
The upper floor view from the hotel on the island of Goree, off Dakar,
Senegal, takes in the picturesque harbour as well as a neglected monument to
Africa's holocaust - the island's slave house, the last staging post in a
terrible journey.
The slave trade has been called the greatest forced migration in the history
of man. Between 1650 and 1850, the period when the trade flourished, some
12m slaves were landed in the Americas, according to one estimate. It is
calculated that 2m perished on the journey and 7m died before embarkation.
Their ghosts can be found on Goree.
Some of my favourite hotels are long gone, like old Meikles Hotel in Harare,
which had high ceilings and wide red-polished verandas.
Some are preserved and thriving: the Mount Nelson Hotel, for example, in the
shadow of Cape Town's Table Mountain. Union Castle passenger liners used to
carry hotel guests across the Atlantic from Southampton, a two-week voyage I
did as a child. They now step off a 12-hour flight from London; but the
hotel still recalls an era past and residents write postcards home from
escritoires in a stately lounge.
Some have evocative names, like the Mountain of the Moons Hotel, Fort
Portal, in western Uganda, overlooking the Ruwenzori Mountains.
Others have powerful associations, like the hotel in Stanleyville, now
Kisangani, on the bend in the Congo river made famous by V S Naipaul's
classic novel. They were terrible times in the Congo in the 1960s.
The Belgian Congo, now Zaire, was in bloody post-independence upheaval. The
country symbolised anarchy: a confusing battlefield of communists,
nationalists, secessionists, mercenaries and United Nations troops. Belgian
refugees streamed across the border with Northern Rhodesia. To the whites of
neighbouring Southern Rhodesia, it seemed a harbinger of their own fate.
Schoolboy memories of Stanleyville, whose reverberations reached me in my
home in Gwelo, Rhodesia, would have been enough in themselves to draw me to
the city. But my interest was whetted by the recollections of journalists
who covered the Congo, equipped with Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriters, and
who filed by cable. Some ended their careers in Salisbury, ancient mariners
telling tales of expense claims on a heroic scale.
It was not until 1985 that I made my pilgrimage. The hotel had become a
pit-stop for trans-Africa safaris, but the ghosts were there.
Other hotels on my list I arrived at by chance. Like the Karibu Hotel near
Goma, in eastern Zaire, with a wine list that harked back to the days when
coffee exports flourished and French fashions and Belgian chocolates were in
the town's high street windows. I was stranded at the airport one minute,
the next minute rescued by the local coffee baron and drinking champagne on
the banks of Lake Kivu.
The crisp air and the mountainous scenery were a world away from the steamy
heat and seamy intrigue of Kinshasa. Even Fanta orangeade tasted special in
the Restaurant Ca Depend, off the main road from the airport to Goma. It was
served with engaging informality, the proprietress nonchalantly uncapping
the bottle with her teeth, plonking it down on the red-and-white check
tablecloth, and chewing the cap reflectively as she moved back behind the
counter.
Some while ago I added the Pointe Venus Hotel on the Indian Ocean island of
Rodrigues to my tryst list. A wood-slatted verandah surrounds an elegant but
fading colonial residence, one of the first built on the island, and perched
above Port Mathurin.
But closest to my heart is the Kuchawe Inn, on Malawi's Zomba Plateau. It is
a 30-minute drive from Zomba, the sleepy former colonial capital. The rooms
are on the very lip of the plateau, each with its own balcony. I recall
morning tea while looking down on hawks circling in the valley; fresh
strawberries; an idyllic lake; cows as sleek as if they lived in
Switzerland; and walking in the plateau's cool forest with the ghosts of old
Malawi and a companion by my side.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Europe's changing cities: Dreams of leaving Lisbon's slums -
The government and the city council have agreed a plan to rehouse all
shanty-dwellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sleeping dogs, dead rats and discarded syringes lie along the dirt paths
leading into a forlorn neighbourhood of shanty dwellings and slum houses,
sprawling across a Lisbon hillside in the shadow of a multi-storey shopping
centre.
Young men question outsiders before admitting them to the rows of crumbling
houses and dilapidated shacks made of planks, plastic sheeting and
corrugated iron. The only visitors they expect are the police or drug-takers
looking for supplies.
One long-standing resident, Mrs Maria Leonor, 32, lives here with her family
of seven in a one-room dwelling made by her husband, a street vendor, by
nailing rough pieces of timber to wooden struts. The city council gave them
the boards and nails after a fire destroyed their previous shanty home in
1985.
Mrs Leonor is out of work and has never learnt to read or write. She points
up stone steps strewn with rubbish to the tap where she fetches water. Three
men facing a nearby wall look round furtively as they inject themselves in
the forearms.
This is Casal Ventoso, acknowledged by Portuguese officials as one of the
worst slums in western Europe. Mrs Leonor's home is just one of 38,000
shanty dwellings in Portugal, housing an estimated 43,000 families. Most of
them share one ambition: 'I just want to move out into a home that is safe
for my children.'
Little has been done to alleviate the plight of shanty dwellers since
bairros de lata - 'tin-can quarters' - first appeared in Portugal almost a
century ago. But the centre-right government is now embarking on an
ambitious Es270bn (Pounds 1bn) programme to eradicate shanty towns and
rehouse their occupants before the end of the century.
'The shanties prick at the conscience of the whole nation,' says Mr Joaquim
Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public works, transport and
telecommunications. 'No other country at the same level of development as
Portugal suffers from this shameful problem.'
Under the plan, the government will pay for the construction of new homes
and local authorities, most of which are controlled by the opposition
Socialist party, will administer them and subsidise rents according to the
occupiers' means. Most shanty dwellers pay no rent and low, if any, utility
bills.
Migration from the rural interior to Lisbon and Oporto produced many of the
existing bairros de lata in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the workers who
built Lisbon's April 25 suspension bridge, which opened in 1966, still live
in nearby shanty towns.
Others, like Pedreiro dos Hungaros to the west of Lisbon, are populated by
immigrants from Portugal's former African colonies, mainly the Cape Verde
islands. The atmosphere is more convivial here than in Casal Ventoso, but
conditions are just as bad.
Several factors foment the building of shanty towns. Portugal has no pool of
low-rent, state-owned housing. The private rent market was undermined by a
40-year rent freeze that discouraged owners from renting out properties and
is only now slowly being re-animated. And taxes amounting to more than half
the cost of a house help put buying a home beyond the reach of many low-wage
earners.
More than 5,000 shanty dwellings have been destroyed in Lisbon since a
coalition of Socialists and Communists won control of the city council in
1989. This month, the government and the council agreed on a Es72bn
programme to build 11,129 houses to rehouse all the families in the city
still in shanty towns.
Most will be moved into apartment buildings. And surveys among residents
dismiss as sentimental myth the opinion that they will miss the open-air
life, vegetable plots, chicken runs and community spirit of the bairros de
lata. 'We're not aware of a single person who would rather stay in a shanty
town than move into a flat,' says Mr Vasco Franco, the Lisbon city
councillor responsible for the rehousing programme.
But Mr Franco fears that the pressures that led to the growth of the shanty
towns will continue and possibly increase. Many construction workers will be
attracted to the capital by an extensive infrastructure programme, including
the building of a new bridge over the Tagus river, the Expo '98
international exhibition and the housing programme itself.
The city council demolishes every new shanty dwelling that appears,
currently at a rate of four of five a day. But other forms of cheap
accommodation are taking their place. 'There are small apartments in Lisbon
where up to 20 people sleep in rows of bunk beds, paying by the night,' says
Mr Franco. 'The only lasting solution to the problem is for the state to
invest in building a large pool of accessibly-priced homes.'

THE RUSSIAN government has awarded Gama Industry of Turkey a Dollars 17m
contract for the first phase of repairs to the White House in Moscow, the
parliamentary building blasted by tanks and gunfire during the anti-Yeltsin
rebellion a month ago.
Gama started work on the building within days of the rebellion ending on
October 4 but it only recently secured a contract.
'We started work with only a verbal agreement. There was no time to talk
about price and money, they wanted the work done quickly so we went ahead,'
Mr Ergil Ersu, Gama's managing director, said. 'It was in front of the whole
world's eyes, so we had to go ahead and trust our client.'
About 200 Gama construction workers were already in Russia working on other
projects.
Within a week, a further 500 had been flown from Turkey along with equipment
and tools. The company is repairing damage to the low-level section of the
White House.

  [Text] Macao, Jan 11 (AFP)--Portuguese Prime Minister 
Anibal Cavaco Silva is to visit China in April, followed by 
President Mario Soares later in the year, Portugal's Lusa news 
agency reported Tuesday. Quoting sources in Beijing, it said 
Cavaco Silva's trip would mark the seventh anniversary on April 
13 of a treaty which he signed to return Macao to Chinese 
administration in December 1999. 
  Macau Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira is expected to be part of 
the prime minister's entourage, the news agency added. In stark 
contrast to Sino-British conflicts over nearby Hong Kong, which 
reverts to China in 1997, Lisbon's relations with Beijing over 
Macao are officially described as "excellent." 
  Portugal has occupied Macau since 1557, but has recognized 
Chinese sovereignty over the enclave on the south China coast 
since 1974. Chinese Premier Li Peng invited Cavaco Silva to 
visit China when he visited Lisbon in February last year, Lusa 
said.

FT  05 FEB 92 / Macao To Keep 'Great Autonomy' After Hand-over
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Vasco Rocha Vieira, Macao's Portuguese governor, said after talks
with Chinese premier Li Peng yesterday the enclave would maintain 'great
autonomy' after it reverts to Chinese rule in 1999, agencies report from
Lisbon.
'Macao will have its own laws, its market economy, with all the rights that
are guaranteed today,' Gen Rocha Vieira told Portuguese journalists.
In a 1987 accord Portugal agreed to hand over the tiny territory on the
south China coast after almost 500 years of rule from Lisbon. Under the
agreement Beijing agreed to maintain the capitalist economy and give a 'high
degree of autonomy' to Macao for 50 years after the transfer. 'The
sovereignty of China will only show in defence and foreign affairs,' Gen
Rocha Vieira said.
Known as the Las Vegas of the east, the 16 sq km Macao has grown rich as a
gambling and tourism haven, mainly for visitors from nearby Hong Kong, which
Britain has agreed to return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Li was on the final day of a three-day visit to Portugal, after visiting
Italy, Switzerland and the United Nations. He was due to fly to Spain last
night.
Sidestepping the sensitive issue of human rights, Li said on Monday night
that ideological differences should not prevent western Europe normalising
relations with China.
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of Portugal, which is the current
president of the European Community, told Li that China would have to
guarantee respect for human rights before relations with the EC could
improve,
Li is one of the leaders widely held responsible for the killing of hundreds
of pro-democracy protestors in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989.

<LEADPARA>  For a decade now, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos has driven one of the rattiest
cars in Sacramento: a 1979 Olds cutlass convertible that recently reached the
grand old distance of 232,000 miles. A staffer on Ways and Means, Geoff Long,
jokes that the car had two engines, two tops, two interiors and only two car
washes. "It used to be that when you rode in the back of that car, you had to
take your clothes to the cleaner," Long explained. "He had socks you wouldn't
believe." As long as eight years ago, ex-Assemblyman Lou Pappan pestered
Vasconcellos to get himself better wheels. But Vasco -- to whom creature
comforts mean nothing -- refused. "It's served me well and saved the state
thousands of dollars," he explained. "Besides, it's got personality.";    So
it was news when Vasco last week junked the clunk and got himself a new car.
Using the legislature's $400-per-month auto allowance, he got a 1990 Olds
Cutlass convertible. His staff, sensing the best way to tell this story was
with humor, put out a press release announcing the change. For his part, Vasco
played it straight: "I plan to put 250,000 miles on this one," he said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>   PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM;    The trial of Deputy DA Julius Finkelstein's lawsuit
against ex-DA Louis Bergna in San Francisco has produced one fascinating
footnote. You may remember that Finkelstein is claiming that he was illegally
suspended by Bergna during the 1982 district attorney's race. In an attempt to
discredit Finkelstein, Bergna's attorney, Craig Brown, has pointed out that
Finkelstein once secretly recorded a conversation between himself and then-San
Jose Police Chief Joe McNamara. The background was this: Finkelstein was
prosecuting the case of then-San Jose Councilman David Runyon, who in 1977 was
arrested downtown after getting drunk and threatening the cops. It was a
famous case made more so because the cops taped Runyon's tirade.;   
Finkelstein called McNamara to ask about the case and find out what Runyon
said to the chief in a phone call the night of the arrest. Finkelstein taped
that conversation without McNamara's knowledge. Attorney Brown suggested
Finkelstein taped the chief because the prosecutor suspected McNamara of
handing over a copy of the police tape to Runyon's lawyer. But Finkelstein
said the reason he taped the chief was, "I was a young DA and I was concerned
that if there was any disagreement later it would be my word against his."
Whether this will stick is debatable. But Brown scored a point. Outside court,
he characterized Finkelstein's taping of McNamara as "unbelievable. You sure
as hell don't tape police chiefs.";  ALL MY CHILDREN;    More unrest in the
domain of county corrections boss Frank Hall -- this time over charges of
sexual harassment. We're told that five female corrections officers have taken
stress leave. The reasons have to do with the fallout of a romance between a
male sergeant and a female officer at the Elmwood women's jail. The story our
sources tell is complicated but juicy, a kind of daytime soap opera of the
justice system: To document the relationship in question, one or two female
officers took a ribbon from the sergeant's IBM Selectric typewriter. They
consulted with a third female officer, who suggested they should turn it over
to the administration.;    This advice blew up in the face of the third woman.
Our sources say a second male sergeant called her in and berated her for
aiding the sleuths, calling her "an empty-headed bimbo." She went out on
stress leave and filed a sexual harassment complaint against sergeant No. 2.
In an unfortunate coincidence the day she returned, sergeant No. 2 two was
given an employee honor, whereupon the woman went out again.;    Meanwhile,
the original romantic entanglement had more serious repercussions. We're told
sergeant No. 1 one agreed one day to meet his female friend in the parking lot
at Elmwood. Unknown to both of them, the woman's husband had followed her in a
pickup truck. Angered at the meeting, he attempted to ram the two as they sat
in a car. The sergeant drove into the Elmwood sally port and told two female
officers to go out and stop the pickup. Our sources say he did not warn them
that the husband had attempted the ramming. While the two female officers
jumped out of the way, they, too, went out on stress leave.;    When we asked
corrections spokeswoman Laurie Sills whether any female officers had taken
stress leave, she said she didn't know of any off-hand -- but would be unable
to comment if she did. And she said she had no information about the ramming
incident. But our sources say the larger question for Mr. Hear-No-Evil,
See-No-Evil's department is whether these cases -- particularly the ramming --
were promptly investigated. As usual in Hall's department, there are only too
many people telling inside tales.;    Errata: Last week, we botched the name
of the ex-redevelopment agency staffer who married former general counsel Gary
Reiners. It is Sue Cosner.  </TEXT>

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Meyerbeer's 'Devil' Revived </HL>
<AUTHOR> Manuela Hoelterhoff </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Wagner stuck his fingers in his ears whenever he heard Giacomo Meyerbeer's name, or worse, his music. 
Just about everybody else, though, thought he'd been dropped into the Paris Opera House on the wings of song to give the world "Robert le Diable." 
Composed in 1831, "Robert" was the most widely adored opera in 19th-century Europe. 

   The best proof of this is a picture painted by Degas 40 years after the premiere, which shows "Robert" fans worshipfully watching their favorite show. 
The canvas hangs prominently hereabouts in the Metropolitan Museum, but Meyerbeer himself is a long-faded flower of the musical world. 
And his "piece de resistance," which revolves around a Sicilian knight and his fiendish father, has not graced the stage of any American opera house in a century. 
Not even its ballet for randy nuns and their mother superior was attraction enough for a modern producer. 

   Until last Sunday, when Eve Queler presented "Robert" in concert. 
There was no room on the stage of Carnegie Hall for the renegade religious to follow "Robert's" score and "fling off their habits and throw profane objects." 
Maestra Queler had filled the large space with a big orchestra, a big chorus and many singers, including a big bass: Samuel Ramey. 
A large and curious audience gathered to hear him sing Bertram, Robert's Beelzebub father. 
Mr. Ramey shared the stage with singers with higher voices and rising reputations: tenor Chris Merritt as Robert, and two sopranos, Marilyn Mims as Isabelle, the princess Robert loves, and Frances Ginsberg as Alice, the half-sister who keeps him from going to hell. 

   Things began poorly with a thudding, tuneless overture. 
But with five acts to go, most of us figured there'd be plenty of time for the dazzling arias, duets and ensembles that once made Meyerbeer synonymous with French "grand opera" and all the grand operas that have cluttered stages ever since with casts of thousands, elephants and overdressed divas swooning in gilded sets. 

   We owe a lot of this to Meyerbeer. 
This fabulously wealthy son of a Jewish banker in Berlin liked opera to be as upholstered and tasseled as a sofa. 
He came at the right time. 
The July Revolution of 1830 had brought Louis Philippe to the throne and Louis Veron to the Paris Opera's management, neither of them penny pinchers. 
And Meyerbeer didn't have to worry about competitors. 
The retired Rossini was eating roulades not writing them, and that nice little man, Daniel Auber, was really more suited for the "opera comique," though he had composed a successful "grand opera," "La Muette de Portici," about a violated mute maiden. 

   Meyerbeer always got the most glittering casts possible, and nobody glittered more in 1831 than his Robert, Adolphe Nourrit, a fat tenor with a delicate high C. 
I mention that note because it appears many times in the score and eventually drove poor Nourrit out his apartment window when he was only 37 years old. 
Nourrit took high C in a crooning falsetto. 
This became instantly old hat when his competitor, Gilbert Duprez, began belting the note full voice from the chest for the first time in opera history. 
He left all Paris weak-kneed with excitement and Nourrit in a winded funk. 
At his lovely funeral, Chopin, another man with delicate lungs, played the organ and novelist George Sand eulogized Nourrit's "passionate, glowing tone." 

   Mr. Merritt seems like Nourrit and Duprez stuck together -- a large, egg-shaped body, a ringing high register topped by a powerful high C, which he sings easily with a happy look on his face. 
He was amazing: sure-footed in his coloratura passages, delicate in lyrical moments. 
So fervently did he sing his interminable second-act aria that one only noticed halfway through that the song was going nowhere and neither was the opera. 

   Though "Robert's" orchestral parts are often intriguing with their somber, muted keys and little flickers of sound-painting, a lot of the music does sound rather shortwinded. 
Once Meyerbeer got a little tune, he wouldn't let go, but he usually didn't develop it either. 
And as a tale of good struggling with evil -- well, Eugene Scribe, the librettist, wasn't Goethe, though Mr. Ramey with his imposing voice nearly succeeded in turning the man's dross to gold. 

   I guess it's wise to keep a historical perspective. 
An opera like this led to greater operas by the younger Verdi (whose pageant-filled "Aida" and "Don Carlo" were influenced by Meyerbeer), and better ones by Meyerbeer. 
The soaring love duet he later composed for "Les Huguenots," a piece revived by the West Berlin State Opera, is more deeply felt than anything in "Robert." 
And nothing Robert sings is as pretty as "O paradis" from Meyerbeer's last, posthumously produced "L'Africaine" (staged next season at the San Francisco Opera with Placido Domingo as Vasco da Gama.) 

   Still, uneven as "Robert" proved to be, it did offer some rewards near the end of the four-hour-long marathon. 
Smoothly supported by Ms. Queler, Ms. Mims gave an account of "Robert, toi que j'aime," that was so ravishingly sung and sophisticated, those of us who remember her barefoot and bumping into the scenery as Lucia di Lammermoor only a year ago in Norfolk, Va., couldn't help but be amazed. 
The transformation is astonishing. 
And Ms. Ginsberg let her big, fluffy soprano drift beautifully through a scene featuring a somber trumpet. 

   This mournful tune even impressed Wagner, who wrote about its "unearthly sound." 
Then he added another crabby page to a long essay in which he proved to his satisfaction that Jews couldn't write music. 

   To keep our total attention, "Robert" probably needs the kind of full-blown staging the Paris Opera gave it three years ago. 
On the live recording, you can hear the audience whooping happily when those nuns started popping out of their tombs to entice Robert. 

   Then again, maybe the work just needs to be heard by a well-fed writer. 
Meyerbeer always plied music critics with liquor and food at a fancy restaurant before any opening night. 
They repaid him by falling asleep, writing nice things or both. 
Ethics are stricter now. 
Nobody took me to dinner and so I was conscious for every empty note.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Alberto Sardenberg] </F>
  [Text] The economic team believes that it is losing control 
of the Real Plan. After President Itamar Franco trampled on it 
in the chapters on rents, school fees, and the antitrust law, 
the economic team now finds itself facing a greater threat: the 
regulation of banking interest rates. 
  President Franco has asked Deputy Benito Gama (PFL-BA) 
[Liberal Front Party - Bahia] to hasten the presentation of the 
draft bill regulating Article 192, Paragraph 3, of the 
Constitution, which establishes that real interest rates (not 
including the inflation rate) cannot surpass 12 percent 
annually. (Public federal bonds currently earn an interest rate 
of 25 percent.) 
  But it so happens that Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero had 
asked Deputy Gama exactly the opposite, that is, to delay as 
much as possible the presentation of the aforementioned draft 
bill. 
  Deputy Gama presides over the special Chamber of Deputies 
Committee that will present the draft bill by order of the 
Federal Supreme Court. The first deadline for presenting the 
draft bill is 20 June, but Gama had agreed with Ricupero that he 
will ask for an extension of the deadline. 
  All the members of the economic team, without exception, 
consider it absurd to regulate interest rates. According to 
them, it is wrong in theory, unfeasible in practice, and 
politically incorrect. 
  President Itamar maintains a populist view that high 
interest 
rates are caused by bank profiteering with the connivance of the 
Central Bank, while the economic team members believe that the 
high interest rates are the consequence of the chronic 
inflationary state of the Brazilian economy. 
  The whole logic of the Real Plan foresees minimum government 
intervention in the economy. If government intervention is 
necessary, the idea is to maintain economic neutrality so that 
contracts in the new currency maintain the same equilibrium. 
  Directly inspired by President Itamar, exactly the opposite 
was done with the conversion [into URV, real value unit] of the 
school fees. Although they officially remain silent, the 
economic team members believe that the formula to convert the 
school fees [into URV] is simply absurd, because it takes into 
account the nominal average fees of the previous four months 
rather than the nominal real average fees. 
  The economic team also believes that the president's 
intervention undermined the rent issue. Besides, the delay in 
making a decision has resulted in some inflation points being 
carried over to the inflation rate of July, the first month in 
which the real will come into circulation. The rent contracts 
that are converted into URV now will be paid in June, and they 
will then be included in the composition of prices. 
  The economic team members believe that the uproar the 
president made over the antitrust law has had a single effect: 
an effective increase of prices, besides creating an atmosphere 
of instability which is something very negative for the new 
currency. 
  They believe that it is not necessary to issue an arrest 
warrant against businessmen to make them lower their prices. 
They believe that prices will remain stable because the public 
deficit will be under control, the economy restrained, without 
any excessive demands, and because the real will break the 
inflationary inertia.

<TEXT>     And they claim the road will clear the way for construction of a
controversial four-lane toll road that could become a major transit link
between the South Bay and Vacaville.;    Despite those warnings, Alameda
County supervisors gave a green light Tuesday to the new route proposed by the
Contra Costa Water District.;    The water district needs to move two-lane
Vasco Road because it will be flooded once Los Vaqueros Reservoir is built
four years from now. And Contra Costa water officials came to Alameda County
because the road straddles the two jurisdictions.;    "This is a water supply
project," said John Gregg, assistant general manager for Contra Costa water.
"Somehow, we ended up in the transportation business.";    According to Mark
Evanoff, field representative for the Greenbelt Alliance, the water company
should stick to what it knows best.;    "This is the wrong place to build a
roadway," he said.;    Evanoff said the area is a nesting ground for eagles
and falcons and is habitat for 20 rare or endangered animal species. The new
road also would come within 1,000 feet of the Vasco Caves, a historic
gathering spot for Indian tribes whose artwork remains on the cave walls.;   
Sierra Club representative David Nesmith warned that planned construction of
80,000 new homes in suburban Contra Costa County will create "tremendous
pressure to place a toll road in this area.";    "I think we're being
dishonest unless we assume a four-lane facility will be approved," he said.;  
 The environmentalists urged supervisors to endorse a more circuitous Vasco
Road change that would go through less sensitive terrain near the Altamont
Pass.;    Their bid was defeated.;    Supervisors voted 4-0 to endorse
building the new Vasco Road, overturning an earlier decision by the county's
planning commission.;    Planning commissioners opposed the route, saying they
lacked enough information about the proposed 85-mile pay road linking Sunol
and Vacaville.;    The state has approved the private road, but the proposal
is being opposed by environmental groups. It still faces a complicated process
before construction can begin.;    Supervisor Ed Campbell, who represents
Livermore, said the so-called Mountain House route proposed by
environmentalists was too long and would place too much traffic on already
busy Interstate 580 in Livermore.;    Campbell said he was convinced the new
road wouldn't be converted into a toll route, which he said was "many years"
away.;    Supervisors supported the new route with the provision that it
remain two lanes wide.;    Board President Mary King also asked for assurances
from Contra Costa water officials that builders of any toll road would have to
pay taxpayers for the full cost of constructing the route.;    Contra Costa
water users will bear the full $450 million cost of the new reservoir, which
includes an estimated $50 million for the new road.;    The road still must be
approved by Contra Costa County officials.  </TEXT>

  [Excerpt] Yesterday Vitor Constancio, the former secretary 
general of the Socialist Party (PS), accepted [PS leader] 
Antonio Guterres's request to participate in the list for the 
party's National Commission. Constancio's return to active 
partisan politics is considered "a very important event" by the 
PS leadership. The political apparatus' "boss," Jorge Coelho, 
saw it as a "great contribution to the party's central objective 
of winning the 1995 legislative elections." 
  Together with Constancio, Jaime Gama, Torres Couto, and Jose 
Lello also returned to the party's higher leadership. The list 
proposed by Guterres, which will go to a vote on 25 February, 
also includes former Social Democratic Party (PSD) member Helena 
Roseta. Guterres now hopes to convince Constancio to head the PS 
list for the European Parliament elections. Decisions will be 
made after Guterres's reelection as secretary general, expected 
on 11 March. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva's activities 
and policies have been the subject of commentaries in the 
Portuguese press. 
<H5>  Visit to China, Repercussions for East Timor </H5>
  Writing in the 18 April Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, 
political analyst Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa characterizes Cavaco 
Silva's recent visit to China as his "return to `realpolitik.'" 
Cavaco Silva went farther than other European leaders in 
deemphasizing the issue of human rights, saying that on this 
issue there is only a "difference in emphasis" between China and 
Portugal. Rebelo de Sousa notes that in a recent speech, 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Durao Barroso defined national 
interest as the main criterion for Portuguese foreign policy. 
The prime minister's statements during his China visit suggest 
that the government has already chosen its policy on East Timor, 
Rebelo de Sousa writes. If "realpolitik" is considered more 
important than human rights in China, the same ought to apply to 
Indonesia. The problem of East Timor is thus reduced to 
realpolitik that takes into account Indonesia's importance, the 
international context, and Portugal's real influence in the 
area. This might lead the Indonesian Government to accept 
regional autonomy for East Timor and the Portuguese Government 
to agree to it as a basis for discussion "without losing face in 
the long term." If this is in fact Portuguese policy, the 
government should make it clear so that no illusions are 
cherished about Portugal's role in the East Timor issue, Rebelo 
de Sousa concludes. 
<H5>  "Cavacoism" Criticized </H5>
  In an article in the 14 April Lisbon weekly VISAO, former 
Social Democratic Party (PSD) deputy and now PSD critic Helena 
Roseta accuses Cavaco Silva of arrogance and secrecy in 
government decisions. In presuming he is "infallible," the prime 
minister "disdainfully ignores the vertiginous changes taking 
place in the world" and expects from the people "obedience, 
discipline, faith, and gratitude." "Cavacoism" persists in a 
"simplistic" and "authoritarian" approach to an increasingly 
complex and uncertain world. The role of "national savior" that 
Cavaco Silva has arrogated to himself is incompatible with a 
modern vision of society, Roseta notes. His "patriotic and 
moralistic fundamentalism" is a genuine "disease of power," a 
virus that the country should urgently shake off, she concludes. 
<H5>  No Cavaco Silva Presidency Seen </H5>
  According to Jose Antonio Saraiva's "Politics 
Portuguese-Style" column in the 9 April Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, 
Cavaco Silva will not be a presidential candidate at the end of 
President Mario Soares's current term. Cavaco Silva would like 
to be seen in history as the prime minister who ensured 
political stability, economic recovery, and Portugal's 
integration into Europe, Saraiva writes. He would thus be 
reluctant to give up leadership of the government at a time of 
crisis, when the European Union is undergoing what is perhaps 
its "most turbulent" phase. Having excluded himself from the 
race, Cavaco Silva would like to support the candidacy of 
Socialist Party luminary and Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio, Saraiva 
contends. This would allow him to maintain "a certain tension" 
in the relations between the prime ministership and the 
presidency, a prospect that is not "displeasing" to him, as a 
"subservient" PSD president would not be in his interest. 
According to Saraiva, however, Sampaio could not attract the 
support of the PSD, a party already divided by the opposition of 
some members who reject any departure from social democratic 
ideals. The same problem would apply to another candidate, 
former President Ramalho Eanes, Saraiva contends. Other 
potential candidates mentioned by Saraiva are Minister of 
Defense Fernando Nogueira, a "logical choice for the Cavacoist 
apparatus," Francisco Pinto Balsemao, a PSD party founder, Joao 
de Deus Pinheiro, a former minister, and General Vasco Rocha 
Vieira, who is now governor of Macao.

  [Text] Macao, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Macao Governor General 
Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira said that the forthcoming visit of 
Portuguese Premier Cavaco Silva to China would not only 
consolidate the friendly relations between the two governments 
of Portugal and China, but would also further strengthen such 
friendly relations of the two sides. 
  He made his remarks when leaving Macao this evening for 
Lisbon, for the purpose to accompany Portuguese Premier Cavaco 
Silva's visit to China. 
  He said "I think that the efforts made by the two 
governments 
in strengthening their friendship and mutual trust will be 
beneficial to Macao." 
  He continued, Macao is now in the transitional period, 
noting 
that so long as the two Governments of Portugal and China get 
along with each other friendly and make joint efforts, the 
transition can be carried out smoothly. 
  The Macao governor will accompany Portuguese premier to 
visit 
Beijing and Shanghai. The premier will also visit Macao for 
three days starting from April 17 after concluding his visit to 
China.

FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (5): How TV got Gama
to Russia - The dynamism of the country's construction sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Russian troops blasted the White House building in Moscow during the
anti-Yeltsin rebellion, executives at Gama Industry in Turkey watched on
televison with particular interest. For they were working out how to put the
building back together again.
Within days of the ending of the rebellion on October 4, Gama was on the
phone to Moscow. A verbal agreement was secured on October 14, and Gama
workers were on site the next day.
It is only a small contract - Dollars 17m for the first phase of repairs -
but Gama, one of Turkey's leading construction and engineering groups, was
keen to establish a reputation in Russia.
It is a story that illustrates the relative dynamism of Turkey's private
sector. Gama is owned by its managers and other key employees, although it
is considering a stock market flotation.
Gama earns much of its income from public contracts at home. It undertakes
big infrastructure projects, including hydroelectric schemes, a new
underground rail system and residential building. But, while the government
is battling to contain costs and reduce the budget deficit, Gama is looking
overseas for new work.
'Spending on infrastructure projects is our bread and butter,' says Mr Ergil
Ersu, Gama's managing director. 'But on the other hand, Turkey has to cope
with an inflation problem. To reduce inflation, this government, or any
other government, needs to curb investment.
'A second point is that Turkey is borrowing - securing foreign financing to
support such projects. There is a limit to this  .. As much as we want to do
more work in Turkey, we realise there are limits.' The domestic market,
according to Mr Ersu, cannot be relied on in coming years to sustain
Turkey's large construction sector, which contributes about 5.5 per cent to
gross domestic product.
Along with many other companies in the sector, Gama has grown steadily by
tapping the overseas market. It is the second major push by Turkish
contractors in recent years to bolster earnings abroad because of a
tightening domestic market. Turkish construction companies produced
spectacular growth overseas in the mid-1980s because of a depression in the
industry at home in the early 1980s.
In the past year, contracts won overseas have pushed Gama earnings towards
an even split between domestic and foreign work. Turnover more than doubled
last year to Dollars 97.8m, producing pre-tax profits of Dollars 7.62m
against Dollars 3.97m in 1991. It currently has Dollars 500m contracts in
progress, and says it is close to concluding a further Dollars 500m.
Contracts secured in the past two to three years have averaged about Dollars
200m.
Gama has targeted Russia and other countries in the Commonwealth of
Independent States for expansion. It believes that, despite the
uncertainties, there are vast opportunities in Russia's wide-open market.
'No matter what, even if governments change, there will be a need for our
services,' says Mr Ersu.
The company, which employs on average around 5,000 contract workers, has
operated in eastern Europe since 1985 in a joint venture with four other
Turkish contractors. Last year, Gama pulled out of the Mir Construction
partnership to build up its work as a single operator. As a result, nearly
half of its new business volume last year came from Russia.
Gama recently completed a 650-room luxury hotel in Sochi on the Black Sea
coast, in which the company retains a 16.6 per cent interest. The Dollars
35m hotel, which is due to take its first guests by the end of the year, is
operated by Radisson, the US hotels group. The contract did not produce a
huge profit for Gama, but like the White House deal, it was important in
terms of visibility.
'We see the hotel as our show case in Russia,' says Mr Ersu. 'It has the
best of everything - carpets from the UK, wallpaper from Belgium, kitchens
from Sweden, marble from Turkey.'
Gama's investment in the hotel represents a further strand of
diversification. It is shifting away from construction into property, mining
and tourism. Construction is still the core business, but, says Mr Ersu,
'there are ups and downs in contracting work, so we are investing in a way
that will provide more constant returns and improve overall cash flow.'
Other big contracts in Russia include a Dollars 78m complex in Moscow for
Gazprom, Russia's gas distribution company. Work began in April on its
36-storey headquarters, due to be completed by mid-1995. The company is also
building a Dollars 12.5m hotel and offices in Tyumen, western Siberia, to
service the oil and gas industry.
It recently completed work with Babcock and Wilcox International of Canada
on a Dollars 100m heat-waste project in Bratsk, east of Lake Baikal. The
project, for which Gama won Dollars 35m of the work, was to convert heat
generated at a pulp and paper mill into energy.
Gama's push in eastern Europe could underpin growth for the company in
coming decades. Earlier this month, Turkmenistan signed a letter of intent
with a US-Turkish consortium, including Gama, that could lead to the
construction of a Dollars 4bn natural gas pipeline across Europe. A
feasibility study on the project is under way.
The company has secured small contracts in Turkmenistan, including a Dollars
10m scheme for a mosque, financed by a Turkish government grant. But it
believes that opportunities are limited in other Turkic states, which it
says would be hard-pressed at the moment to secure western financing.
Gama is established in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia,
although it has secured fewer contracts in the region recently than it had
hoped. Elsewhere, the company signed a Dollars 50m contract last month to
build a cement plant in Malaysia in partnership with Krupp of Germany.
Several high profile contracts are under way at home. Work began in March on
the first phase of Ankara's underground metro rail system. Gama has secured
a Dollars 260m contract shared with Guris of Turkey to build a 15km line and
station from the city centre to the west, due to open by the end of 1996 or
early 1997. Other companies in the project include Bombardier and SNC
Engineering of Canada.
One of Gama's biggest contracts to date is for a 672MW hydroelectric power
dam on the Euphrates river at Birecik close to the Syrian border. Gama and
Philipp Holzmann are leading a European consortium on the DM2bn contract,
which was signed nearly a year ago. Gama says it hopes financing
arrangements will be finalised soon.
The project is a build, operate and transfer (BOT) scheme, under which the
consortium of Turkish, German, Belgian, French and Austrian contractors
build and operate the dam and then transfer it to the government under a
15-year contract. Gama has a 19.4 per cent stake, Philipp Holzmann 16.4 per
cent, TEK, Turkey's state electricity company, has 30 per cent, and the
other three companies hold smaller stakes. The financing package will be in
export credits and commercial loans. The dam, which will take more than five
years to build, is part of Turkey's south-east Anatolian project to provide
irrigation and power in the poor and arid south-east.
Gama has linked up with Thames Water of the UK on a Dollars 700m water
supply scheme for the city of Izmit, east of Istanbul. The plant was to have
been financed by government money, but it was converted to a BOT scheme when
the budget allocation was cut. Financing, which is still to be finalised,
will now come from export credits, commercial loans and direct investment by
the partners.
Gama will construct the dam and pipelines. The water treatment plant will be
built jointly with Thames Water, the majority owner, which will operate the
plant. The project is underpinned by government guarantees to buy the water
and energy.
For the moment, Gama will continue to look east, towards Asia and the CIS,
for future growth. It believes that while Ankara's politicians look west, to
membership of the European Union, it will be some time before Turkish
industry as a whole will be able to compete effectively in western European
markets.

<LEADPARA>  When the people running San Jose's City Lights Theater Company put on a
fund-raising show last night for their new theater at 529 S. Second St., they
reached, naturally, for the city lights. Their show -- a Robin Hood theme done
over a roast pig dinner -- happened after our deadline. But we managed to get
a sneak preview from the cast. Queen Elinore was played by former Supervisor
Susanne Wilson, who was required to give a toast about making babies. The
nasty Prince John was played by San Jose Rep founder and World Festival
promoter Jim Reber. In a stroke of inspired casting, the sheriff of Nottingham
was played by San Jose Auditor Jerry Silva. Maid Marion was played by
Stephanie Schiro, who described herself jestingly as the "bimbo of Sherwood
Forest." And the rest of the cast included Mercury News City Editor Charlie
McCollum, Metro publisher David Cohen, Sunnyvale Councilman Larry Stone,
Downtown Directory publisher David Katz and our own Leigh Weimers, who played
the earl of Nottinghamshire, a nobleman known for having perfected the art of
torture.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  DIGITAL MADNESS; At the time, it sounded like a very big deal, maybe the
biggest. Last June 20, U.S. Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett -- the former
minority leader of the California Assembly -- flew back to San Francisco to
announce the biggest drug bust in California history: a $4 billion seizure of
heroin in Hayward. Just one modest problem: The Customs people may have been
guilty of exaggeration. According to the Washington Journalism Review, the
customs mathematicians initially proposed a street value of $1.6 billion for
the Hayward seizure. That wasn't nearly enough for the PR folks, who inflated
the value to $4 billion. The Customs people -- including Hallett -- say they
got the figure from the Drug Enforcement Agency. But no one at DEA buys that.
A recent DEA study suggests the real value of the heroin was only $600
million. And on the streets of Washington, D.C., it may be less. But what's a
few million among friends?; STRANGER THAN FICTION; A few odds and ends: After
a quarter century in the Legislature, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, D-San
Jose, looks like he's veering upscale for at least one night: Vasco's 25th
anniversary party at the Fairmont Hotel on Sept. 20 will be a $150-per-table
affair. The master of ceremonies will be Treasurer Kathleen Brown, and the
dinner co-chairmen are attorney Al Ruffo and ex-Gov. Pat Brown. The invite
refers to Vasco -- once famous for not capitalizing his letters -- as "the
esteemed Assemblyman from Silicon Valley." . . . A long-time sheriff's deputy
spotted what he thought was a familiar face recently at a Los Gatos restaurant
favored by cops. "Did your brother help build the jail for the county?" he
asked. The man replied that his brother was temporarily detained but had
nothing to do with building the jail. Only later did the deputy learn who he
was speaking with: Joe Bonanno Jr., the son of the legendary mob boss. . . .
Mike Fox, one of the movers and shakers behind the renaming of the San Jose
McEnery Convention Center, has reported back on the costs of including the
Lord Mayor's name. Despite some doubts by skeptics, he says it will only cost
$35,000 to convert marquee, signs and the engraving over the door. And he is
planning a private fund-raiser -- possibly a volleyball match -- to raise the
money.; THE OK CORRAL; Few squabbles in law enforcement generate more heat --
and less light -- than the fight between San Benito County DA Harry Damkar and
Sheriff Harvey Nyland. While the rivalry goes back years, the battle crested
recently when Damkar refused to sign a $160,000 grant proposal for a sheriff's
anti-narcotics task force. Nyland told us that Damkar -- who has been itching
to play a larger role in narcotics enforcement -- set down several conditions
for signing. Among them, the sheriff said, were that Damkar's office be
alerted of all homicides so they could conduct parallel investigations. "He
attempted to hold us ransom," Nyland claimed.;   Damkar has a different
version: He says the dispute can be traced to his hiring of Dennis Stafford, a
former sheriff's lieutenant with a reputation as an ace investigator. Damkar
says the sheriff was angered when Stafford managed to identify a female murder
victim -- Marguerite Busk -- with the help of the "Unsolved Mysteries"
television show. And the DA hints that the sheriff isn't doing an adequate job
of narcotics enforcement. Until he gets cooperation, the DA says, he won't
approve the grants. "It's a matter of principle," he said. Meanwhile, the
sheriff apparently has gotten the grant without the DA's blessing. At last
notice, the two officials weren't speaking with one another if they could
avoid it. (box)  </TEXT>

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Opera: A Bumpy Season at the Met </HL>
<AUTHOR> Manuela Hoelterhoff </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> New York  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For someone not living inside the brain of Bruce Crawford, the Metropolitan Opera remains as mysterious as darkest outer space. 
I say this now that Mr. Crawford's second season as general manager has ended and the traditional annual rite of hand-wringing is upon us. 
It isn't easy to fathom a season that ranged from a spavined new production of Verdi's "Il Trovatore" to a poetic revival of Puccini's "La Boheme." 

   More singers with international reputations are now appearing at the Met than in the past few years. 
It no longer fills its stage with second-rate English aria-mongers. 
But so what, you often said this season, watching well-known people stand around singing the same old stuff, undercoached, poorly directed and all too often miscast. 

   Any company can have a disaster. 
But to fall on your face with Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti takes some doing. 
This pair of vocally cosmic stars has never been suited for the churning drama of "Trovatore." 
Droopy-faced, they stood near the prompter's box, avoiding a staircase set much too steep for top heavy torsos and also sidestepping the wobbling Livia Budai, who wandered across the stage as Azucena inciting choruses of boos as she went. 

   What would it have taken to let Ms. Sutherland retire gracefully from the company, trilling into the night in an opera from the bel canto period that she has done so much to popularize? 

   These last few years, the dramatic operas of Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti have been making a comeback in all major European houses. 
Agile singers with coloratura techniques are now more numerous than big Verdi voices. 
But the Met's artistic director, James Levine, has mostly ignored these trends and now the chickens are coming home to roost as the Verdi repertoire becomes increasingly difficult to cast. 
By the time "Trovatore" stumbled in for the last time two weeks ago, only the Heimlich maneuver could have helped Franco Bonanome get through "Di quella pira"; an old buzz saw, Fiorenza Cossotto, was rasping away at the gypsy's music; and Leona Mitchell drifted from pillar to pillar and all too often from the score. 

   Both ladies are favorites of Mr. Levine, so you can hear them yell a little more next season when he conducts a new "Aida" with Placido Domingo as Radames, never one of his best roles. (The San Francisco Opera deploys the tenor more imaginatively, tootling the Horn of Africa as Meyerbeer's Vasco da Gama). 

   One might have more confidence in the Met's future if its music director were a little more demanding. 
But he also presided over that listless "Cosi fan Tutte" whose funniest moment happened offstage when Kiri Te Kanawa, the Fiordiligi, suddenly demanded that the woman slated to sing Despina be removed from the first performance because she could not act. 
Why did Ms. Te Kanawa stop there? 
Nobody else was acting up a storm. 

   Maybe the conductor's mind has been on heavier matters such as his European conducting career and the Met's new "Ring" cycle, which he is recording for posterity. 
In the cozily old-fashioned staging by Otto Schenk, the Met's "Ring" is as colorful and nutritional as a bag of Gummi Bears, but the singing has been serious. 
Two splendid new heldentenors, Wolfgang Neumann and Toni Kramer, took turns as Siegfried waking up Hildegard Behrens, a radiant Brunnhilde; Waltraud Meier, debuting as Fricka, woke everybody else up with her bright voice and tight dress. 
Late in the season, Leonie Rysanek sang a couple of Sieglindes that drove her admirers into ecstasy, though she is, vocally, hardly as well-preserved and pitch-true as that other sexagenarian, Alfredo Kraus. 

   The eternal youth was on hand to don the silks of the Chevalier des Grieux in "Manon" and the tear-stained blue coat of the sorrowing Werther. 
At once refined and passionate, dapper and fresh-voiced, Mr. Kraus lacked nothing in either role except a seductive Manon. 
When Carol Vaness sat down on his lap you wondered if he would ever walk again and if a repertoire coach had been near her before the curtain rose. 
How could the Met let a talented artist make such a clumsy impression? 
Mr. Kraus was more fortunate in his Charlotte, Frederica von Stade, whose refined, pathos-filled singing survived the sluggish conducting of Jean Fournet. 

   On the whole, though, the level of conducting seems slightly improved, even if someone attending say, the pension-fund benefit, probably would have found the evening more festive had the receipts gone to retire the conductor Nello Santi. 
This Signor Hum Drum seems to be taking over much of the Met's Italian repertoire while Mr. Levine searches for Valhalla (Doesn't he know that the only way to get there is to die in battle? 
On second thought, maybe he does). 
If any Met conductor is going to heaven for his work this season, it ought to be either James Conlon, the impressive grand marshal of "Khovanshchina," or Charles Dutoit, who made an elegant debut leading "Les Contes d'Hoffmann." 

   If those two revivals were memorable -- musically coherent, dramatically vivid -- the "Boheme" was close to miraculous. 
Mr. Pavarotti sounded like a young man as he grabbed the hand of his old pal from Modena, Mirella Freni, and they both seemed to soar through the sets like the Chagall creatures, levitated by the force of Carlos Kleiber's baton. 
To get this elusive Munich-based conductor to the Met, Crawford, Levine &amp; Co. had to bite their lips and promise, for once, a definite number of rehearsals and a specific cast. 
It should happen more often. 

   Having fussed over Mr. Kleiber, perhaps the Met can now start working on Czech soprano Gabriela Benackova, she of the beetled brow and glistening voice. 
The Met and Ms. Benackova haven't been able to agree on a suitable vehicle ever since she canceled her debut as Micaela in "Carmen" because she found the part as unappealing as the low fee. 
With only paltry amounts of Reagan dollars to spend, the company's sole bargaining chip is to offer the lady any role she fancies. 

   The Met, by the way, continues to have an oddly difficult time casting next season's Micaela, a part that should be just fine for one of its many bright, young student types, but surely not for Cheryl Studer. 
Was it necessary, for this light French girl's role, to rope in an acclaimed Straussian soprano and a mainstay at Bayreuth, where she will sing Elsa in "Lohengrin" this summer? 

   You can't help wonder. 
To make her over into Micaela is as nutty as turning over the new production of Handel's "Giulio Cesare" to Trevor Pinnock, an exponent of early music who has never stood on an opera podium before. 
Who is making these decisions? 
The Mad Hatter? 

   With luck and the forceful personalities of Tatiana Troyanos and Kathy Battle, maybe the production will pull together. 
"Cesare" is certainly the most interesting presentation in a modestly inspired season that includes a new "Salome," more "Trovatores," and welcome revivals of "Don Carlo" and "Idomeneo." 
I cannot work up much enthusiasm for the promised "Erwartung," a frenzied "geschrei" by Arnold Schonberg. 
Like the other "avant-garde" pieces the Met has been willing to try these past years, it was fresh long before I was born. 
The Met has a way of pulling out 50-year-old operas acknowledged as classics everywhere else ("Lulu" and "Wozzeck") and trying to pass them off as daringly modern. 
The real cutting edge in opera is to be found right now in Milan, where La Scala is premiering the latest installment of the "Licht" (Light) cycle by Karlheinz Stockhausen. 
He celebrates his 60th birthday this year, an event of some significance everywhere except at Lincoln Center.

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On April 25, 1974, soldiers under the
command of young left-leaning army captains toppled a 48-year
dictatorship and were showered with red carnations by rejoicing
civilians.
   Fifteen years after the ``Revolution of the Carnations,'' the
Portuguese armed forces are back under right-wing leadership,
facing flagging popularity and an urgent need for reform.
   The decision by Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, a Social
Democrat, to name the conservative Gen. Antonio Soares Carneiro as
armed forces chief over the army's own, more moderate candidate has
stirred discontent even within the military.
   The controversy comes at a time when cooperation between
generals and politicians is seen as important for the success of a
four-year plan to trim military manpower and modernize equipment.
   ``Soares Carneiro was not chosen by the army _ it was obviously
some sort of political compensation,'' said Maria Carrilho, a
leading sociologist and author of ``The Armed Forces and Political
Change in 20th Century Portugal.''
   ``It shows party politics and the military are still too closely
interconnected in Portugal, something that shouldn't be the case in
a consolidated democracy.''
   In 1980, Soares Carneiro ran for president as the candidate of
the Conservative alliance that joined the Social Democrats with the
right-wing Social Democratic Center.
   His campaign collapsed after reports were published that he had
authorized the internment of opponents of the Portuguese
dictatorship in a ``recuperation camp'' in Angola toward the end of
Portugal's African colonial wars in the early 1970s.
   Former officers who took part in the 1974 revolution say a
traditionalist resurgence in the military is likely to further
taint the forces' already flagging prestige among Portuguese youth.
   ``In the period following the revolution, soldiers were the only
ones the people would trust,'' said Lt. Col. Vasco Lourenco, a
revolutionary captain in 1974. ``Today, the armed forces are almost
ashamed to have had anything to do with April 25 and have withdrawn
into a shell.''
   Ms. Carrilho said that since the abolition in 1982 of the
governing Revolutionary Council, which was dominated by the
military, politicians have moved anybody linked to April 25 out of
influential positions.
   Lourenco, who now heads the private April 25 Association he
co-founded after military and government formally split in 1982,
complains that military men today haven't been able to make
civilians understand the role of the military in democratic
Portugal.
   ``Nowadays, the armed forces sense a certain rejection in
Portuguese society,'' said Lt. Col. Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, the
mastermind of the 1974 coup who was sentenced last year to 15 years
in prison on charges of being the leader of a left-wing urban
terrorist group.
   ``Although the masses still have a soft spot for the soldier of
April 25,'' he said in a prison interview, ``people are now asking
_ why do these guys exist? Portugal's not at war, so what are they
doing? They don't produce anything.''
   A recent survey by Lisbon University indicated that 66 percent
of recruits performing obligatory military service think the draft
should be done away with and that service in the armed forces
should be voluntary.
   ``With relations improving between the United States and the
Soviet Union, it's natural that young people all over the world are
asking themselves what the armed forces are for,'' said Gen. Amadeo
Garcia dos Santos, who sees reform long overdue.
   ``The army today is more or less what it was before the
revolution, in terms of structure, mentality and equipment.''
   Military analysts say Portugal's 90,000-member armed forces are
still large for a small country of just over 10 million people,
even though it is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The need for large land forces to fight the colonial wars in
Africa has left an imbalance among the three service branches.
   The army has about 45,000 active soldiers, making it three times
larger than the air force and the navy.
   But this could change as Portugal strives for a more active role
in NATO.
   According to Alvaro Vasconcelos at Lisbon's Institute for
International and Strategic Studies, Portugal's aim is to play a
more important role in anti-submarine warfare, which would require
greater naval and air strength.

<LEADPARA>  For those who relish invective, one of the more inspiring exchanges occurred
recently between Assemblyman John Vasconcellos and Los Angeles County
Supervisor Pete Schabarum. Schabarum, you may remember, was the author of
Proposition 140, the initiative that imposed term limits and axed legislative
staffs. Last month, Vasconcellos told the press that he was thinking about
quitting the Assembly because of the hackles of the measure. "I don't see any
point in killing myself for people who apparently don't care if they have
decent government or not," said Vasco. His kicker: "The only reason for me to
stay is to outlast that idiot Schabarum.";    Schabarum responded last week
with a snotty two-page letter to Vasco. "I would have thought that someone
with your resources of self-esteem would have been able to weather through the
public's displeasure without any disturbance to the prescribed mellow mood."
He then went on to question what Vasco could do in private life, suggesting
that the assemblyman was out of touch. "I read your comments about quitting
not as a threat, but as a promise," Schabarum wrote. "And I challenge you here
and now to perform on it."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>   THE UNION BUG;    Just as the Daily News strike in New York City carries
disproportionate weight for the future of New York labor, the current AFL-CIO
boycott of the De Anza Hotel in San Jose matters more to local labor than the
number of De Anza workers -- some 40 -- would suggest. In Silicon Valley,
where the vast majority of high-tech workers are non-unionized, labor finds
its leverage through politicians. When the Fairmont Hotel opened more than
three years ago, Mayor Tom McEnery was able to avert picketing at his downtown
showpiece only by persuading Mel and Richard Swig to sign a so-called
"neutrality agreement." That agreement -- which labor is also seeking at the
De Anza -- allows for quicker procedures to recognize a union. As our business
writer Ron Wolf noted, what happens at the De Anza could determine how labor
deals with the two larger hotels planned for the convention center.;    The
Central Labor Council's business manager, Rick Sawyer, has argued that the
$2.8 million in public subsidies to the De Anza makes union representation an
issue of fundamental fairness. And labor may ultimately win this one: Among
other things, the organizers of the Silicon Valley Charity Ball recently
canceled a press conference scheduled for the De Anza. But the union doesn't
possess the leverage it had at the Fairmont. First, the De Anza isn't as
central a showpiece. And while the Central Labor Council split its mayoral
endorsement between Frank Fiscalini and Susan Hammer, some in the Hammer camp
felt that Sawyer leaned toward Fiscalini.;  DIGITAL LAWMAKING;    We all know
the public intended some kind of wrist slap when it voted last November to
mandate heavy cuts in the staffs of state legislators. But maybe not everyone
slapped with the same force. Less than a week after the cuts went into effect,
a constituent called State Sen. Al Alquist's office with what undoubtedly was
a pressing question: Just what day of the month was it? Fortunately, an
Alquist staffer, Tracy Johnson, was on hand to give the answer: Feb. 5.
Incidentally, the Assembly and Senate chose very different paths in making the
cuts that let nearly 600 employees go. The Assembly made most of its cuts in
the local offices: The San Jose offices of Assemblymen John Vasconcellos and
Dom Cortese took heavy hits. The Senate, however, made most of its cuts in
Sacramento.;  FIDO KNOWS;    One of the hotter murder cases in Santa Clara
County is that of Rob Carlotto, the Stevens Creek Quarry mechanic accused of
murdering his wife, horse trainer Blair Miller-Carlotto. (Blair is the
daughter of North County political figure Diana Miller). The case has
generated reams of newspaper and television coverage. One detail, however, has
escaped much attention. It deals with a rug. Last December, Los Altos police
confiscated a rug that Carlotto ordered replaced 10 days after his wife
disappeared. While the rug apparently contained no blood stains, there was a
missing piece. Late last month, a DA's investigator, Robert Hamilton, talked
with the carpet layer, Ronald P. Mills. According to a search warrant
affidavit, Mills said that Carlotto asked him to cut out a section of the
carpet to put in a doghouse. Mills did so. The defense contends that there is
nothing sinister here. In fact, the defense investigator, Brian Vierra, turned
over a 28-by-39 inch piece of carpet to the cops. But the police determined
that the missing section of carpet was approximately 50-by-87 inches. When
they searched Carlotto's home a second time last month, they were looking for
the fragments. Nothing made public so far indicates they've found any smoking
gun.  </TEXT>

   A bandit wearing a handkerchief to

railroad crossing, authorities said.
   Conrail police and the Ottawa County Sheriff's Department are
investigating the robbery of two Conrail crew members aboard a
freight train, sheriff's dispatcher Gale Zelms said Sunday.
   Conrail spokeswoman Barbara Vasco said a man armed with a
shotgun boarded the freight train Saturday while it was stopped at
a railroad crossing to check an air leak.
   The bandit, who wore a handkerchief tied around his head, robbed
two crew members of personal belongings and then ran off, the
spokeswomen said.
   The 60-car train was en route from Chicago to Newark, N.J. Ms.
Vasco said the train was carrying miscellaneous consumer goods. She

The lifting of controls allows foreigners to operate in Portugal's

<TEXT>
SHAKESPEARE may have had it right. From Billingsgate fish market to ports
and docksides on the far side of the world, fishwives can be creation's
crudest, most foul-mouthed creatures. But the dramatist and I differ in our
basic approach to the women who stand behind fishy-smelling market stalls.
As a lover of good language, he had little sympathy for them. As a lover of
good fish, I do.
I doubt if Shakespeare ever made the short walk down the Thames from the
Globe theatre to Billingsgate fish market at an hour and season when
fishwives are apt to be at their crudest, foul-mouthed worst. Not long ago I
left a comfortable bed to wander the Lisbon waterfront at just such a moment
 -three o'clock on a cold winter's morning. I can report that compared to
the tempers most of us would develop while messing about with slippery, iced
fish on a rain-swept morning, the mood displayed by these much-maligned
women remains a model of reason.
Whatever the Bard's opinion of fishwifery, it is an honourable profession.
The Portuguese, I found out, do not denigrate their fishwives as we do ours;
they value them highly. But then neither do the Portuguese abuse fish as we
on this scepter'd isle do. Not for Lisboans batter-coated fish fingers,
mushy peas and soggy chips - they do with fish, I discovered, what
Shakespeare does with words.
For some reason there are few Lisbon fishwives over the height of five feet
two inches. They are tiny, wrinkled, baggy women with kerchief-covered hair
and little disposition for fashion; they wear heavy skirts below ragged
pullovers or anoraks, tie plastic aprons around non-existent waists, and
display raw, red knees and hands that look freshly skinned. Nonetheless, on
the wharves of the Tagus River beside Lisbon's main market, the Mercado da
Ribeira, they are undisputed queens.
Later on in the day this market will see more than 1,000 men and women at
work piling crates of oranges and lettuce, making pyramids of big yellow
squashes, and carrying great sacks of carrots balanced on their heads -
fresh fish, meat, poultry and vegetables are all sold in vast quantities
here. But at 3 am this is the private realm of the fishwife, the purveyor of
some of the most sought after foods in the country.
Down at the water, where strong winds whip the waves of the Tagus estuary
into a dirty brown froth, fish arrive by boat and lorry from ports up and
down the Portuguese coast - from Nazare, Peniche and Avero to the north of
Lisbon, from the Algarve, Sesimbra and Setubal to the south. Packed in ice
in shallow crates, the catch - some of it still wriggling - is rattled on
trollies over rain-splashed cobbled streets to the dock's main auction hall.
It may be hard to detect, but there is some order among the scores of women
milling about here in the glare of white-tiled surfaces and bright
florescent lighting. Shouting, cajoling, mocking, and gesticulating, they go
about their business with all the lusty energy and forcefulness they and
their sisters everywhere are famous for.
Some pile crates of fish high on to weigh-scales, others drag them along the
floor with metal hooks, while still others make vigorous inspection of their
contents. Chapped hands stroke the dark striped bodies of sea bass. Noses
pinched with cold sniff at the gills of red mullet. Practised eyes measure
the length of long, flat scabbard fish coiled into their crates like so many
lengths of silvery fire hose. Nylon string sacks of clams and mussels; crabs
with claws stopped open with wooden pegs; chocolate-dark lobsters that will
soon be flaming red; all come in for intimate perusal and evaluation.
The night's vital moments come when individual lots of fish are put up for
auction. Here, as in much of the rest of continental Europe, bidding for
fish is made on descending, rather than rising, prices. The successful
bidder is she who makes the first bid as the auctioneer progressively lowers
the price for the item on offer. As a system it is as fair as the one we
know, but it does introduce a greater element of tension; instead of having
multiple chances to bid for a lot, the potential buyer has only one.
That the women are bidding for turbots and conger eels rather than Turners
and Constables does not make the auction any less interesting for those
involved. As in any other domain of public activity in Portugal, connections
and personal prestige count for a good deal at the fish market. Many of the
fishwives, as an alternative to selling their auction purchases directly to
market customers, act as buying agents for Lisbon's hotels and seafood
restaurants. Here the politics of fish buying can be bloodthirsty and
unforgiving. As every Lisbon restaurateur knows, having a fishwife of power
and influence fighting on your side can make or break you.
Curiously, Portugal's most popular fish can be found at the market but is
not on sale at the fish auction. The cod or bacalhau so beloved of the
Portuguese is not bought fresh but heavily salted and dried as stiff as a
board. Requiring up to three days of soaking before use, it forms the basis
of more than 300 dishes, making inspired use of such simple ingredients as
potatoes, onions, eggs and olives. Not so long ago the humble food of poor
Portuguese living inland and unable to obtain cheap, protein-rich fish any
other way, bacalhau has today taken on prestige status and is found on the
most elaborate of menus.
Once the waters of Newfoundland's Grand Banks teemed with cod and for six
months every year were home to a large Portuguese fishing fleet. Today,
however, the Banks are overfished and the fleet is depleted. Much of
Portugal's cod is purchased from Norway. Of the country's 11,000 working
boats fully two thirds are powered by oar or sail, and only about 100 are
deep-sea vessels. Steeply rising cod prices have now put bacalhau out of
reach of the people whom it originally benefitted.
Fish nonetheless remains a staple of most Portuguese people. But few popular
dishes, no matter how modest, bear any resemblance to the horrors that issue
from that most English of institutions, the fish and chip shop.
Fisherman themselves boil up huge kettles of fish soup on the beach using
sea water, onions, garlic, tomatoes and part of the day's catch. All over
the country, fresh, fat sardines are cooked out in the streets by village
women using small grills made of baked earth; accompanied by a glass of
refreshing vinho verde, they make a delicious summer meal. Even that most
frugal of poor man's dinners, acorda de mariscos, is a delight; requiring
nothing more than the addition of an egg, fresh coriander and the water in
which shrimps have been boiled, it transforms yesterday's stale loaf into a
fragrant bread stew.
After my early morning exertions at the fish market, I felt I had earned
something more than bread stew. I took a local train out to Cascais where
the Tagus meets the open sea. No longer just a quaint little fishing
village, Cascais is home to some of the most elegant fish and seafood
restaurants in Portugal.
Here you can listen to Atlantic rollers pounding the beach, and watch
high-prowed, brightly-coloured wooden fishing boats bobbing on an even more
brightly-coloured sea. More importantly, you can do all this and at the same
time sit at a restaurant table and choose from among the best and freshest
fish in the world.
I went to a restaurant named after its owner, Joao Padeiro, a man celebrated
as a minor god in Cascais for the quality of his fish. After a bowl of Senor
Padeiro's shellfish soup and a plate of his reknowned fried sole, I, too,
celebrated all manner of minor gods. Not least among them was that array of
little ladies who begin their day rather early at the Mercado da Ribeira.

<TEXT>     Vasco says self-esteem has gone from ridicule to respect. But then I
haven't written about it for a whole year.;    He's certainly right that
self-esteem has become a popular buzzword. Any program that promises to
prevent a social problem bills itself as a self-esteem program. Why not, if
the chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee is a self-esteem
enthusiast?;    Education, always fad-happy, is pushing self-esteem -- or
calling things teachers have done for years self-esteem programs.;    And Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. -- the same guy who has a $50,000-a-year aide on his
payroll to study paranormal phenomenon like the fact that the word "Simone"
can be heard if you spend hours listening to George Bush's speeches played
backward -- plans to introduce legislation for a national commission on
self-esteem.;    "What is fast becoming the working definition of
self-esteem," by the way, is: "Appreciating my own worth and importance and
having the character to be accountable for myself and to act responsibly
toward others.";    But you knew that already.;    When not equated with the
Holy Grail, self-esteem is generally a good thing -- Saddam Hussein aside.
Parents should try to instill self-respect and self-confidence in their
children. Adults should spend more time and energy on achieving their goals,
and less time and energy kicking themselves for their failings, calculating
just how much blame goes to Mom, how much to Dad and how much to Mrs. Grady in
the second grade and -- this is a hobby more popular than bird-watching --
whining.;    But the self-esteem movement has more ambitious goals. It wants
your government to have high self-esteem. Is this deserved? Is this safe?;   
Vasco is pushing a new, life-affirming, responsible, trustworthy, multiracial,
gender-equal ("men can be feelingful"), visionary, inspiring politics, and it
all "grows out of the report 'Toward a State of Esteem' of the California
Self-Esteem Task Force.";    Thirty-thousand copies of the task force report
have been sold, Vasco boasts.;    But the worth and importance of self-esteem
wouldn't be appreciated so highly if anybody had read "The Social Importance
of Self-Esteem," a compilation of the reports of researchers commissioned by
the task force to prove that self-esteem is "the most promising and practical
and strategic approach to problem-solving," as Vasco now claims.;    The
book's editor, Neil J. Smelser, admits in the introduction: "One of the
disappointing aspects of every chapter in this volume . . . is how low the
associations between self-esteem and its consequences are in research to
date.";    Researchers tried to find evidence that self-esteem prevents child
abuse, school failure, teen pregnancy, crime and violence, welfare dependency,
alcohol and drug abuse, and concluded that "the associations between
self-esteem and its expected consequences are mixed, insignificant or
absent.";    A year later, Vasco is proclaiming self-esteem a "burgeoning
revolution," a "prime solution" and a "remarkable evolution." (See? It
rhymes.);    He claims that "self-esteem is a social vaccine," because
"healthy self-esteeming persons are less likely to be vulnerable to the
dysfunctional behaviors of crime and violence, alcohol and other drug abuse,
teen pregnancy, child abuse, chronic welfare dependency and educational
failure.";    I guess putting "healthy" in there would mean Saddam is out as a
self-esteem role model.;    But let's do a reality check here. Take take out
the word "self-esteem" and leave in "healthy." Does it make a difference?;   
Try substituting "education" as in: "Education is a social vaccine because
educated persons are less likely to be vulnerable to the dysfunctional
behaviors of crime and violence, alcohol and other drug abuse, teen pregnancy,
child abuse, chronic welfare dependency and educational failure.";    Just as
true, if not more so.;    How about "happiness" as a social vaccine? If
everybody was happy, it would cut the state budget considerably.;   
"Self-discipline" works too. I bet self-discipline prevents more social
problems than self-esteem, though, like Vasco, I can't prove it.;    "Hope,"
"morality," "perseverance," "friendliness," "maturity," "caring" . . . See how
many words you can think of that would make dysfunctional behavior less likely
-- if the government could just make citizens hopeful, moral, persevering,
friendly, mature, caring or whatever.;    Personally, I think the very best
social vaccine is having good parents. Healthy children of good parents are
less likely to be vulnerable to . . . Yep.;    All we have to do is base our
new and human politics (Isn't politics all too human already?) on good
parenting, and our problems are solved before they're started.;    Gosh, that
was easy.  </TEXT>

  [Text] The Spanish Government denied today that it had sold 
weapons to the Angolan authorities. It did confirm that Spain 
was supporting the training of the Angolan Government police. 
Vasco Lourinho reports from Madrid. 
  [Lourinho] New scandals are being uncovered as 
investigations 
proceed into the Luis Roldan affair. The former head of the 
Civil Guard was a discreet intermediate in the sale of Spanish 
weapons to Angola worth 40 billion escudos. The operation was 
carried out with the knowledge of Foreign Minister Xavier 
Solana, who less than a year ago was still trying to deny what 
was a reality. 
  [Begin recording] [Solana in Spanish with superimposed 
Portuguese translation] As you know, we have a commitment to 
Angola. We are contributing to the UN initiatives -- that is our 
role and no more. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] And the weapons? 
  [Solana] We did not sell weapons. We have a commitment with 
the police that we are fulfilling. [end recording] 
  [Lourinho] The deal was made by the Spanish public company 
(DEFEX), which with the help of Luis Roldan, disguised the 
weapons as antiriot equipment.

   For the first time in recent years,
blacks are buying toys, sending Christmas cards and filling their
holiday shopping bags without fear that they will be punished for
breaking a boycott.
   But although some holiday traditions are making a comeback,
others died during the years of unrest and Yuletide protest against
apartheid.
   There is no Santa Claus in Soweto.
   ``We are the biggest store in Soweto but we do not have a Father
Christmas here. We believe that would be something out of place.
That is something that is confined to town (where whites live),''
said Paul Gama, chief executive of the Black Chain supermarket.
   Gama said last year he didn't even offer Christmas items for
sale. This year Christmas cards and inexpensive balls and small
plastic guns are selling briskly.
   ``I think the people must be paying for the lost years in terms
of enjoyment and excitement because this is the first normal
Christmas where there is no tension from any quarter,'' Gama said.
   Santa Claus once was a part of Soweto's holiday imagery, but
since nationwide anti-government unrest broke out in 1984 there have
been calls for a ``Black Christmas.''
   The calls consisted of boycotts against shopping for Christmas
presents and festive food, Christmas Eve blackouts in the townships,
and memorial services for those detained under a state of emergency.
   The township of 2.5 million blacks outside Johannesburg was a
focal point of the unrest.
   People who worked in Johannesburg and bought goods there during
the Christmas shopping period sometimes were attacked by youths when
they disembarked from buses or trains.
   Sometimes boycott-breakers were beaten or killed. In 1986, the
call went out for a Christmas Eve blackout in Soweto and monitors
patrolled the township, knocking on doors if they saw any more light
than a candle.
   There was no formal announcement that this year would be
different, and not even the outlawed African National Congress has a
definitive reason for the renewed holiday spirit.
   ``It is possible that the popular democratic movement has found
other ways and methods to register their feelings about apartheid
without making a public call for a boycott,'' said Tom Sebina, a
spokesman for the guerrilla organization, in a statement from
Lusaka, Zambia.
   People detained without charge have been a major focus of the
``Black Christmas'' protests since a national emergency was declared
in June 1986. The release of hundreds of detainees over the past few
months may have defused some of the motives for protest, although
hundreds, almost all of them black, still remain in custody without
charge.
   One of them, journalist Brian Sokutu, has been held without
charge or trial for 30 months.
   Many Soweto residents go home for Christmas, and home is usually
a homestead in a rural area. For many men and women, the long
holiday period is the only time of the year they see their children,
who are raised by grandmothers in tribal homelands because of lack
of housing and school space in the urban townships.
   In Cape Town, meanwhile, the family of jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela arrived carrying presents and a cake for a Christmas visit.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, their daughter, Zinzi, and their three
grandchildren planned an 80-minute visit Sunday with Mandela at his
suburban-style house on the grounds of the Victor Vester Prison.
   Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, was moved to
the house Dec. 7 after recuperating from tuberculosis at a Cape Town
hospital.
   Under the new terms of Mandela's confinement, his family is
allowed unlimited visits. However, Mrs. Mandela has said the family
will not accept any special privileges from the white-led government
and will make only the standard prison visits of no more than 80
minutes.
   The government's decision to place Mandela in a prison staff
house is seen as part of an effort to release the black leader in
stages.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Gnome improvements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS nothing like a gnome to cheer you up in a recession. Forget the
Private Eye advertisments and the decades of being shunned by polite
society: the little fellows are working overtime to keep us happy during
these difficult days.
At least that is the view of Tessa and John Newman, who for the last four
years have concentrated exclusively on selling garden gnomes. Their company,
De Gama, stocks all sizes, in just about every pose that is not deviant, in
the converted coach house at the rear of their large Regency terrace house
in Bath.
'Apart from a brief dip at the end of last year the gnomes have been selling
better than ever during the recession,' said Tessa. 'We are currently
carrying nearly 200 different styles and expect to sell about 50,000 and to
turn over about Pounds 500,000 in the current financial year.' After 20
years in the importing business - originally they concentrated on Spanish
ceramic ware - the Newmans reckoned they had seen all types and style of
gnome before deciding to concentrate on plastic German models. That was four
years ago. They rapidly found they sold so well that there was little space
left in their warehouse for other lines. The gnomes had taken over.
'Concrete gnomes were too crude and heavy. They chip very easily and rarely
have the fine outlines of our plastic models,' said Tessa.
'Ceramic ones are usually much nicer and we are building up our own range of
these, made by a West Country potter. However, although frostproof, they
break easily - particularly if there happen to be vandals around. Really
they are more suited to indoor conditions.
'On the other hand the plastic ones look equally good inside or outside.
They do not break unless very badly handled, and they retain their colours.
About 15 years ago people didn't seem to like plastic gnomes at all. But all
that seems to have gone now.
'Plastic gnomes seem perfectly acceptable and I would say that about 50 per
cent of gnomes sold in this country are plastic.' Another change in recent
years has been the trend towards keeping gnomes indoors. In urban areas this
may be a result of vandalism, but the Newmans have another theory.
'When you have them in the home they do help to cheer the place up,' John
said. 'During the recession I have noticed that we have sold many more
smiling ones. I say a gnome in the home is worth two in the garden.'
Serious collectors - some people have hundreds - like to keep their gnomes
under cover for security purposes.
'Perhaps this is also because many people laugh at huge collections of
gnomes in the garden. They are after all, things that people either love or
loathe,' said Tessa.
'Many people look upon them as pets without the tie and there is no doubt
that a gnome can bring a great deal of pleasure to many different sorts of
people,' said Tessa.
'We have a huge correspondence, especially from people that want to build up
their collections, but also from people who like to talk about their gnomes;
they even send us poems written about them.'
Even though the indoor market has grown, the UK gnome market is small
compared with Germany and Switzerland.
'The UK market is reckoned to be a quarter of the size of the Swiss one,
despite the fact that our population is much greater,' John said.
'Only 8 per cent of gardens in this country have gnomes in them, whereas in
Germany and Switzerland it is far higher.' The Newmans would like to change
that by expanding the network of agents covering the 400 UK retail outlets
De Gama serves. They aim to sell to some of the big chains of garden centres
where gnomes are not at present welcome.
'We smiled when we saw the recession coming on. It has certainly helped us,'
John said.
'Let's hope there are no booms round the corner. That is the time when
people go out and spend their money on other, more expensive things like big
cars and exotic holidays.'
They could buy one of the Newman's top-of-the-range gnomes: 1 metre high.
One, complete with wheelbarrow, retails at about Pounds 200 compared with
the Pounds 13-Pounds 14 for an average size De Gama gnome.
The greatest possibility for expansion seems to lie in bespoke and
personalised gnomes, says John.
'Providing there is a run of about 1,000 we can do bespoke ceramic gnomes
for specific promotional purposes,' he said.
'We are just realising the potential of this, with orders from businessmen
who want special gnomes that might look like themselves or their customers.
'Companies are also beginning to see the value of gnomes as giveaways at
Christmas, or as promotional tools of a different kind. Really there's a
potential for a whole new breed of Lord Gnomes all over the country.'
