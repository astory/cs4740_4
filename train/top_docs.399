   The British pound surged in a powerful rally yesterday, as the Bank of England abandoned a long struggle to contain the currency's value in favor of a more anti-inflationary strategy. 

   The pound was quoted at $1.8182 in late New York trading yesterday, up 2.5% from $1.7745 Friday. 

   Traders attached more significance, however, to sterling's breakthrough above the 3.00-West German mark level. 
For more than a year, traders said, the British central bank had sought to keep the pound under 3.00 marks through interest rate policies and foreign exchange market intervention. 

   Yesterday, the pound climbed 1.7% to 3.0488 marks in New York, compared with 2.9987 Friday. 
Traders said the Bank of England intervened in early European trading by selling sterling to depress its price but quickly dropped the effort. 
"It was a situation where the Bank of England finally threw in the towel. 
The pressure to push sterling through 3 marks was irresistable," said Robert Hatcher, vice president and corporate foreign exchange dealer at Barclays Bank PLC, New York. 

   In midmorning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 127.93 yen, down from 128.87 yen Monday. 

   Economists interpreted the Bank of England's willingness to let the pound rise above 3 marks as signaling the higher priority the U.K. government places on fighting inflation over stimulating export growth. 
By keeping sterling's value down, the government encourages exports by making British goods less expensive for foreigners, particularly in Europe, to buy. 

   The Bank of England's sales of sterling through intervention to contain the pound's value tended to be inflationary as they expanded the British money supply and put downward pressure on interest rates. 

   Moreover, containing sterling's value has become an increasingly difficult battle. 
Because of recent stability in dollar exchange rates and interest rate differentials favoring British investments, currency traders have been moving heavily into sterling. 

   "If you feel that exchange rates are going to be fairly stagnant, then you're going to go where you can earn high interest rates," James H. Hohorst, managing director of foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said. 

   For more than a year the British government corraled the pound in a range between 2.93 and 3.00 marks. 
Last week the Bank of England sold as much as 3 billion pounds in currency market intervention to offset upward pressure. 
Market economists speculated yesterday that British monetary authorities may now try to keep the pound between 2.95 and 3.10 marks. 
In London, U.K. officials declined to discuss limits it may have for sterling exchange rates. 

   U.K. officials stressed, however, that they haven't abandoned their goal of keeping the pound within a relatively narrow range. 

   The ease with which Britain appeared to raise its sterling target range yesterday is bound to strengthen the hand of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in resisting calls to join the European Monetary System, the eight-currency exchange rate mechanism. 
An EMS currency realignment, by contrast, usually involves complicated and time-consuming negotiations. 
Mrs. Thatcher contends the EMS is too inflexible. 

   The policy shift may lead to renewed dollar weakness, analysts predicted. 
The Bank of England has amassed $42.93 billion in foreign-currency reserves, almost half of it from buying dollars and selling sterling during the past year to support the U.S. currency and keep the pound stable. 
"One of the big (buyers) in dollars is out of the market now," said Brendan Brown, an economist with County Natwest, the investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank PLC. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 10 cents an ounce to $437.30 in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 2.5 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $437.10 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Pound Extends Its Rise, Fueled By High Rates --- Dollar Is Mixed in Light Day As British Investments Offer Alluring Returns </HL>

   Relatively high interest rates continued to bolster the British pound in an otherwise sleepy foreign exchange market yesterday. 
The dollar was narrowly mixed against most major currencies. 

   "Sterling was the only mover in the Street," said Cynthia H. Johnson, vice president and corporate foreign exchange manager at Lloyds Bank PLC, New York. 
Interest rate differentials favoring British investments over those of other major industrial countries provided "a big incentive" to buy sterling, she said. 

   The pound was quoted at $1.7760 in late New York trading, up from $1.7740 Monday, marking its ninth advance against the dollar in the past 11 trading days. 
The pound also strengthened against its European counterparts, climbing, for example, to 2.9970 West German marks from 2.9936. 

   If sterling's current trend continues, traders said a possible showdown looms between market forces and the Bank of England when the pound reaches the 3.00-mark level. 
Over the past year, the British central bank has consistently intervened in trading to prevent the pound from overtaking the 3.00-mark level by selling sterling in the market, depressing its price. 

   The British government is believed to be concerned that if sterling strengthened beyond that point, it would hurt exports to continental Europe. 
That would affect trade with Britain's primary trading partners, many of which have currencies pegged to the mark. 
These concerns were underscored Monday when the U.K. government disclosed a record trade deficit for January. 

   "The Bank of England has a lot of reserves, and they can, if they wish, hold (sterling) below 3.00" marks, Ms. Johnson said. 

   Traders believe Britain is less concerned about sterling's dollar value because the U.S. is a less significant trading partner. 

   Despite the threat of central bank resistance, many dealers find yields on sterling investments irresistible, especially while relatively stable exchange rates overall lessen opportunities for trading profits. 
"When you see the market quiet like this, money moves to high-interest rate currencies. 
If things are quiet, people are going to put money where they can earn interest," said Paul R. Loffredo, vice president and chief dealer at Security Pacific National Bank, New York. 

   Yields on closely watched, three-month Eurodeposits were 9.125% for sterling investments, in contrast to 3.375% for mark instruments and 6.75% for dollar investments. 

   In other trading yesterday, the dollar was little changed. 
The U.S. currency firmed to 128.40 yen, from 128.25, and was unchanged at 1.6875 marks. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 128.45 yen. 

   Statements by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the U.S. and other nations will work toward stable exchange rates and that the federal budget deficit is under control failed to impress the currency market yesterday, traders said. 

   "Looking at rates now, they're not going to have to work very hard to achieve stability," one trader said. 

   Mr. Baker told the Senate Appropriations Committee that a further decline in the dollar could be counterproductive and as a result, the U.S. and its major trading partners will work closely to foster exchange rate stability. 
"I want to assure you that the U.S. will do its part in this effort," he said. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 50 cents an ounce to $431 in brisk trading. 
The estimated volume was 5.8 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $431.50 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Dealers to Focus on U.K. to Determine If It Will Attempt to Stem Pound's Rise </HL>

   Profit-hungry currency traders this week will be focusing on the British government to see if it finally acts to keep a lid on its fast-rising currency. 

   The British pound already has climbed 5% against the dollar and 2.8% against the West German mark in the past seven trading days. 
So dealers and analysts are trying to guess at what point the British government will do something to stem the rise -- if, indeed, it does anything at all. 

   Meanwhile, Britain's economy is robust, its interest rates high, and the Bank of England appears to have abandoned intervention to hold sterling down. 
But last week also was marked by what appears to be a public conflict between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her most senior Treasury official over exchange-rate policy. 

   In late New York trading Friday, the pound advanced to $1.8565 from $1.8460 late Thursday. 

   Right now, the betting is that the British currency will get another shot in the arm tomorrow when Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson delivers to parliament the government's budget for the fiscal year beginning in April. 

   Peter Fellner, a U.K. economist at James Capel &amp; Co. in London, expects Mr. Lawson's budget to show a surplus for the year in addition to as much as #4 billion ($7.4 billion) in tax cuts, particularly to the wealthy. 

   "The budget is likely to be very positive for the pound," says Gavyn Davies, chief U.K. economist for Goldman Sachs International Corp. in London. 
Noting that Mr. Lawson has the opportunity to combine a fairly tight fiscal program with "supply-side cuts in marginal income-tax rates," he adds: "You can get the best bits of Reagan's tax package without the worst bits of Reagan's tax package." 

   As long as the tax cuts are modest and don't threaten the anticipated surplus, "there'll be no downside for sterling," predicts Paul Chertkow, director of economics at Security Pacific Hoare Govett in London. 

   For more than a year, Britain maintained an unofficial policy of trying to hold the pound between 2.93 West German marks and 3.00 marks. 
When the currency threatened to break above 3.00 marks, the Bank of England resorted to intervention -- at times massively -- to keep the pound from rising. 

   The pound-mark rate -- and, thus, the other European currencies that effectively or actually are pegged to it -- are more important to Britain than the pound-dollar rate. 
That's because about 60% of the U.K.'s exports go to Europe vs. 10% to the U.S. 

   But last week, Prime Minister Thatcher's opposition to any more large-scale currency intervention enabled the pound to break through the 3-mark ceiling. 
Having risen as high as 3.0850 marks during the week, sterling stood at 3.0818 marks late Friday in New York. 

   Twice last week, Mrs. Thatcher said that London wouldn't use either "excessive" intervention or lower interest rates to weaken its currency. 
She also argued that "there is no way to buck the market." 
Mrs. Thatcher's prime motive is to battle inflationary pressures in the British economy, which economists say is expanding at 3% a year in real terms with inflation currently at 3.3% and expected to rise to 4% at year end. 
Meanwhile, West Germany's economy is growing at about half that pace with inflation at only 0.9% a year. 

   Mrs. Thatcher's stance has put her at odds with Mr. Lawson, who has advocated maintaining a tightly controlled course for sterling and last week contended that its advance was "unsustainable." 

   Moreover, senior British Treasury officials continue to insist that exchange-rate policy hadn't changed, and have asserted the government would use selective currency intervention and interest-rate changes to keep the pound stable. 

   So far, the market is skeptical. 
"Mr. 
Lawson can hardly stand up now and say we need fixity of exchange rates, Bretton Woods style," says Stephen Lewis, director of economic research at London stockbrokers Phillips and Drew, a unit of the Union Bank of Switzerland. 

   "At the moment we are in a sort of limbo period. 
No one knows what actually the policy is," adds Mr. Fellner of James Capel. 

   Nonetheless, many analysts suspect that the Bank of England has an upper limit in mind and predict that the market will force the issue by trying to push sterling still higher. 

   Many traders believe the first test of London's intentions will be 3.10 marks and come soon after the release of the budget. 
Currency dealers "will be tapping lightly at 3.10 to see if they can bring the Bank (of England) out," predicts Jeff Mondschein, a vice president at Merrill Lynch International in New York. 

   Mr. Davies of Goldman Sachs puts the threshhold a little higher. 
"They won't make much of an effort to stop a rise to 3.15 marks; anything much above that and they will intervene," he says. 
Meanwhile, he sees sterling rising to at least $1.90 to $2 "quite soon." 

   Regardless, traders are nervous. 
Noting that the pound didn't climb to 3.20 marks last week as some people had predicted, James Capel's Mr. Fellner says: "Foreign exchange operators are sitting cautious; they don't know if the Bank of England is lurking around the corner to pounce."

   Friday's Currency Activity
   The dollar fell against most major foreign currencies Friday in what dealers said were quiet, nervous markets. 

   In late New York activity, the U.S. currency stood at 1.6600 marks and 127.36 yen, down from 1.6640 marks and 128 yen late Thursday. 
Dealers said they were apprehensive that Thursday's release of U.S. trade data for January could be negative for the dollar. 

   In midmorning trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 127.20 yen. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $441.30 an ounce, down $1.90 in moderate trading. 
Estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $442.30 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.

   The British pound resumed its rise yesterday, after having fallen the previous day on rumored intervention by the Bank of England. 

   The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, gained against most other major currencies, despite its decline against sterling. 

   Despite the Bank of England's apparent attempt Tuesday to thwart the recent rush of speculative money into the pound, dealers said sterling remains an attractive alternative to the usually more dominant market involving the dollar and the West German mark, which has shown little movement lately. 

   "With no action in the dollar-mark, the sterling cross is commanding attention," said a New York-based trader for a West German bank. 

   In the so-called cross rate between the pound and the mark, sterling yesterday climbed 0.9%, to 2.8818 marks in late New York trading from 2.8558 Tuesday. 
Against the dollar, the pound firmed to $1.5644 from $1.5610. 

   The relatively stable dollar-mark rate has decreased opportunities for making profits from trading those units, dealers said. 
That, in turn, has increased interest in sterling. 

   The relatively higher yields on sterling-denominated investments make the pound an attractive alternative. 
Optimism about a budget proposal due from Britain's government on March 17 also continues to fuel sterling purchases. 
The budget is expected to include a tax cut and reduced government borrowing needs. 

   In New York, William G. Orsini, corporate foreign-exchange manager for Bank of Montreal, said traders also believe that Britain's economic outlook justifies the pound's gains. 
He cited this year's surge on London's stock exchange, in contrast to the decline in West German stock prices. 

   In other foreign-exchange activity yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.8421 marks from 1.8295 and firmed to 153.76 Japanese yen from 153.56. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 153.70 yen from 153.76 in New York yesterday afternoon. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery climbed $3.20 an ounce to $410.40 in moderate trading. 
Volume was estimated at 3.5 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $409.25 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.

<HL> U.S. Currency Is Mixed, Sterling Gains;
Interbank Trading Spurs Wide Swings

   The U.S. dollar was narrowly mixed and the British pound stronger as both currencies seesawed in foreign-exchange trading yesterday. 

   Dealers attributed the wide swings to short-term speculative moves -- generated by interbank trading -- that didn't represent any change in the long-term outlook for either currency. 

   "It's basically the exchange market trading with itself," said James M. Pugh, vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York. 
"Corporate demand isn't there on either side." 

   The Bank of England was also rumored to have intervened in yesterday's trading, selling sterling at levels near the top of the currency's rise. 
Officials at the central bank and British Treasury declined to confirm the intervention rumors but reiterated that the government doesn't have specific exchange-rate targets for the pound. 

   The dollar's movement against the bellwether West German mark was the widest swing between those currencies in three weeks, traders said. 
The dollar traded as low as 1.8538 marks in early European dealings and climbed to an intraday high of 1.8733 during brisk, midday trading in New York. 

   Expectations for the release of bullish U.S. economic indicators, beginning with today's retail sales report, were partly responsible for the dollar's rise against the mark, traders said. 
But much of the move was purely on speculation, they added. 
"Buyers came out of the woodwork," Mr. Pugh said. 

   Then sellers followed, as speculators took profits on the dollar's rise, driving the currency back to 1.8600 marks in late New York trading, up slightly from 1.8565 Tuesday. 

   Trading in sterling followed a similar pattern. 
After trading as low as $1.5840 early in Europe, the pound climbed to an intraday high of $1.6000, and then fell back. 
"It just got hammered," said Anthony J. Murphy, senior dealer at Royal Bank of Canada, New York. 
"I don't think it was a change in philosophy, just profit-taking." 

   In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.5933, up from $1.5865. 

   A trader for a British bank maintained that the Bank of England sold sterling yesterday to slow the momentum of the currency's rise. 
The pound has drawn attention recently as Britain's high interest rates have siphoned speculative capital from the comparatively stable market between dollars and marks. 

   Against the Japanese yen, the dollar eased to 153.69 yen from 153.73. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery rose 10 cents an ounce, to $406.90, in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 2.2 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $407 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.

   Belgium to Reduce 2 Rates
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
   BRUSSELS, Belgium -- Belgium's central bank said it is
cutting two interest rates one-half percentage point each,
effective today.
   The reductions will lower the discount rate to 8% from
8.5% and the Lombard rate to 8.25% from 8.75%.
   The central bank said it is reducing the rates in reaction
to recent rate cuts in other European nations and to reflect
the "better position" of the Belgian franc in the European
Monetary System.
   The discount rate is the lending fee charged by central
banks to financial institutions, while the Lombard rate is a
rate under which banks borrow from the central bank using
certain securities as collateral. The Lombard is
traditionally meant only for last-resort financing.

   The U.S. dollar eased against most other major currencies and sterling also weakened yesterday as rumors of central-bank intervention earlier this week tempered bullishness for both currencies. 

   The rumored intervention "took the steam out of the market . . . it just died," said Robert K. Ryan, vice president, foreign exchange at Irving Trust Co., New York. 

   Meanwhile, the effect of yesterday's better-than-expected report that U.S. retail sales climbed 4.1% last month was offset by a downward revision of the January figure, to a 7.4% decline from the 5.8% drop originally reported. 
"The February number was great, but the revision was horrendous," Mr. Ryan said. 

   As previously reported, the Bank of England is believed to have sold sterling on Wednesday to slow the pound's recent surge. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve Board was also rumored to have sold dollars Wednesday in New York and yesterday in Asia to damp the U.S. currency's rise. 

   The rumors, though unsubstantiated, prevented many market participants from acting on their generally bullish near-term view of both currencies. 

   Traders have been cautious about opening or maintaining large currency positions in the wake of a Feb. 22 agreement meant to stabilize exchange rates between the U.S. and five top economic allies. 

   "They really don't want the market to run away with the currency," said J. Steven Stekly, a Bank of Boston trader, referring to the Bank of England's rumored sterling intervention. 

   In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8590 West German marks, off from 1.8600 the day before. 
The dollar slipped to 153.38 Japanese yen from 153.69. 
The British pound eased to $1.5875 from $1.5933, and dipped to 2.9512 marks from 2.9635. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Friday the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 153.45 yen from 153.38 in New York yesterday afternoon. 

   Despite the downward revision of January retail sales, traders said the February figure supports the market's more positive attitude toward the dollar that has stemmed from earlier economic reports. 
And so-called technical analysis of charts illustrating the dollar's recent trading pattern -- which many dealers study -- indicates continued gains by the U.S. currency. 

   "Technically and fundamentally, the dollar is in a bullish trend for the near term," said John W. Baker, chief foreign-exchange trader at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co., New York. 
"We've been having higher highs and high lows each day. 
The dollar is trading beautifully in an up channel." 

   "Sterling is also following a perfectly bullish trend line" on charts, Mr. Baker said. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery rose $1.80 an ounce, to $408.70, in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 3.1 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $409.20 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.

   The dollar eased in quiet foreign-exchange dealings yesterday as market participants awaited Friday's report on U.S. merchandise trade. 

   Traders' expectations that the report covering December will show a continued shrinkage of the trade deficit supported the dollar in a stable but narrow trading range. 
Despite such optimism, uncertainty about the Commerce Department's trade data discouraged many dealers from taking large positions. 

   "People are perfectly content to stay inactive until the trade number," Robert Hatcher, vice president and corporate foreign-exchange dealer at Barclays Bank PLC, New York, said. 

   With activity in the dollar stymied by anticipation of the trade data, "cross-trading" increased among the British pound, West German mark and Japanese yen. 
"That's typical of a market that isn't confident on where the dollar's heading," Mr. Hatcher said. 

   In cross-trading, the pound eased against the mark yesterday after British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he doesn't see any "great pressure" for higher British interest rates. 
The comment, made in Brussels after a meeting of the finance ministers of the European Community, contradicted market speculation that an official rate increase is in the works. 

   Higher British interest rates would increase the appeal of sterling-denominated investments and, in turn, demand for sterling. 
In late New York trading yesterday, the pound stood at 2.9679 marks, off from 2.9738 Monday. 

   When asked by reporters whether he saw a need to increase interest rates in the near term, Mr. Lawson said he would act "when necessary." 

   Mr. Lawson also told reporters that Britain has for the past year pegged the pound in line with the eight currencies in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. 
Asked whether Britain would join the EMS mechanism, Mr. Lawson said, "We hope to continue with a policy that encourages exchange-rate stability." 
He declined to be more specific. 

   His comment concerning sterling's relationship to the EMS didn't immediately affect the market, but it confirmed speculation. 
From watching the Bank of England's pattern of foreign-exchange-market intervention over most of last year, dealers have assumed that Britain is enforcing a trading range for sterling between 2.95 and 3.00 marks. 
The EMS is centered around the West German currency. 
"Sterling has been a shadow member of the EMS for several months," said Barclays's Mr. Hatcher. 

   The pound inched higher against the dollar, as did most other major currencies yesterday. 
The pound firmed to $1.7510 from $1.7495, while the dollar eased to 1.6950 marks, from 1.6998. 
The dollar was unchanged at 128.83 yen. 

   In midmorning Tokyo trading Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 129.05 yen. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Tuesday, gold for current delivery rose $1.20 an ounce to $441.60 in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 3.4 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $442.35 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Sterling's Surge
Halts; Intervention
By U.K. Rumored

   The British pound's surge halted yesterday as the Bank of England was widely rumored to have intervened in currency markets to cool speculative interest in the currency. 

   Although the central bank's rumored selling of pounds for West German marks appeared to be effective, sending sterling lower, dealers said that the British currency still holds considerable investor interest and could rebound. 

   Meanwhile, against a backdrop of bad economic news, the U.S. dollar fell against most other major currencies as it continued its lethargic trading in a narrow band. 

   Sterling's sharp gains prior to yesterday's rumored intervention were partly caused by inaction in trading of dollars for West German marks in recent weeks, dealers said. 
The situation directed speculators' attention to higher-yielding currencies, such as the pound. 
The Australian and New Zealand currencies also have attracted new investor interest, dealers said. 

   Traders said the Bank of England's action was aimed at "smoothing out" sterling's latest exchange-rate swing. 
"They fired a warning shot across the bow, and it was effective. 
The market took heed," said Robert Hatcher, vice president and corporate foreign exchange dealer at Barclays Bank Ltd., New York. 

   Mr. Hatcher said the rush of speculative interest in the pound may have worried the British government, which would prefer more stable exchange rates as it prepares to release its federal budget later this month. 
"The problem is, when you have a lot of hot money moving into the sterling market like that, it can slide out of the country just as fast," he said. 
"The last thing they want right now are currency gyrations." 

   In late New York trading, the pound stood at 2.8558 marks, down 0.6% from 2.8741 Monday, when the pound rose 1.7%. 
Sterling had climbed to more than 2.88 marks yesterday before the rumored intervention. 
Against the dollar, the pound slipped to $1.5610 from $1.5643. 

   Relatively higher British interest rates have attracted speculators to sterling during the recent dollar-mark doldrums. 

   Yields on three-month sterling Eurodeposits are almost five percentage points above similar dollar investments and more than six points higher than for three-month mark Eurodeposits. 

   Traders expect additional developments to benefit sterling. 
The British government's new budget is expected to be released March 17 and to call for tax cuts and lower public borrowing needs. 
The budget is seen as possibly enhancing the reelection chances of Britain's Conservative government, which would also help the pound. 

   "Prospects for sterling still look better than on anything else," said Frank Pusateri, senior corporate trader at Bank of Boston. 
"If they {the government} push the right buttons at the right time, that could make sterling look even more attractive." 

   Speculation that the Bank of England may also soon decrease its lending fee to financial institutions is also helping the pound indirectly, traders said. 
They said some investors are buying sterling to purchase British government bonds in the expectation that the value of those securities will rise following any interest-rate cut. 

   In other foreign-exchange trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.8295 marks from 1.8373 and to 153.56 Japanese yen from 153.70. 

   The dollar's decline came amid more weak economic statistics that confirmed the generally bearish climate for the currency but failed to shake it out of its narrow trading range. 
The government reported that U.S. leading economic indicators fell 1% and that single-family home sales dropped 6.8% in January. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 153.48 yen from 153.56 in New York yesterday afternoon. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery climbed $3.60 an ounce, to $407.20, in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 2.8 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $406.45 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
   Currency analysts in Britain and the U.S. expect the pound to continue its upward move this week, buoyed by Britain's high interest rates and differences over exchange rate policy inside its government. 

   The pound could be poised to breach the 3.20 West German marks level, analysts say. 
In late New York trading Friday, the pound stood at $1.8915, up from $1.8832 Thursday. 
It climbed to 3.1853 marks from 3.1681. 
For the week, the pound rose 1.7% against the dollar and 1.9% against the mark. 
Traders say the Bank of England intervened in Friday dealings, selling sterling against dollars and marks, but the intervention appeared to be aimed at smoothing market conditions. 

   The upward pressure on the pound, which has created strains between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, led to more political turmoil in Conservative government ranks. 

   On Friday, Sir Geoffrey Howe, the foreign secretary and a longtime Thatcher loyalist, appeared to support the chancellor's quest for more stable exchange rates, against the prime minister, who says governments shouldn't "buck" the currency market. 
In a speech in Scotland, Sir Geoffrey repeated the government line that the U.K. will join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System "when the time is right." 
But he departed from his text to say: "We cannot forever go on adding that qualification to the underlying commitment." 

   Sir Geoffrey's remarks were construed as evidence that government policy is in disarray. 
Weekend press speculation cast doubt on Sir Geoffrey's political future and suggested that Mr. Lawson may want to leave office later this year, adding to concern about exchange rate policy among Conservative members of Parliament. 

   In a radio interview yesterday, Sir William Clark, chairman of the Conservative parliamentarians' finance committee, called on Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Lawson to issue a statement saying that agreement exists on exchange rate policy. 

   Aides to the prime minister's office said yesterday that there isn't a rift between Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Lawson; that she isn't planning a cabinet reshuffle; that Sir Geoffrey has made remarks about the monetary system before, and that more explicit remarks by Mrs. Thatcher about the pound would only play into the hands of speculators. 
"There are no plans at all for a statement" about the pound, a spokesman for Mrs. Thatcher said. 

   Normally such political uncertainty is poison for a currency, but Geoffrey Dennis, international currency economist at London stock brokerage James Capel &amp; Co., said the turmoil is contributing to upward pressure on the pound. 
Mr. Lawson has so far failed to sway Mrs. Thatcher to more stable exchange rates, Mr. Dennis noted. 
If the chancellor or Sir Geoffrey were to quit, there would be even less resistance to the prime minister's free market views, he said. 

   Traders said Friday interest in the pound was sparked by a Bank of England report that was widely interpreted to mean that the central bank favors higher interest rates to combat domestic inflation. 
The bank said in its quarterly report, issued late Thursday, that it would prefer a different monetary policy mix from its current one, saying: "a combination of a stronger currency and lower interest rates doesn't represent an ideal response to current (inflationary) concerns and a different balance would be desirable." 

   The pound also received a boost when Mrs. Thatcher, during parliamentary question time Thursday, declined to say if she agreed with Mr. Lawson's view that the pound shouldn't appreciate further. 

   These factors helped convince market participants that the government's ability to control the pound's ascent is limited. 
J. Thomas Stanley, vice president of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York, said, "I think we're on our way to 3.20 (marks)." 

   Away from day-to-day concerns, economic factors have bolstered the pound. 
Later this week, the British government will publish data on employment, average earnings, money supply, bank lending and retail prices, which are expected to underline the present robust economic growth but also the persistence of underlying inflationary pressures. 

   Although some economists in the City, London's financial district, fear that strong domestic demand could lead Britain into a damaging balance of payments crisis later this year, foreign investors are more impressed by evidence of the country's economic dynamism. 
Another reason for currency dealers to flock into sterling is the lack of movement in dollar exchange rates against other major currencies. 
This limits opportunities for trading profits. 

   "The quieter the (dollar) market is in general, the more we're looking for currencies with a discernible trend to them," Trevor W. Woodland, vice president of foreign exchange at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said. 
"Since there isn't a lot of activity in other currencies, it's very easy to zero in on sterling." 

   In other trading Friday, the dollar firmed but was little changed against other major currencies as dealers squared positions ahead of tomorrow's release of U.S. trade data for March. 
Economists figure that a robust rise in U.S. exports probably pared the trade deficit from February's $13.83 billion. 

   In midmorning trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 124.70 yen. 

   On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold rose 30 cents an ounce, to $452.20, in moderate trading Friday. 
The estimated volume was 3.4 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $452.50 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Baker Remarks Help Sterling Continue Rally --- U.S. Treasury Chief Seeks To Allay Fears of Shift In U.K. Monetary Policy </HL>

   Sterling's rally stretched into its fifth day yesterday, encouraged by remarks of U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker endorsing the recent shift in British monetary policy. 

   Trading again focused on the pound's exchange rate with the West German currency, which rose 0.3% to 3.0822 marks in late New York trading yesterday, from 3.0720 Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, the dollar firmed against most major currencies. 

   Sterling gave up some of its gains from earlier in the day, following selling to take profits on its rise over the past week. 
The pound finished the New York trading day at $1.8445, up slightly from $1.8424 the day before. 

   Sterling's so-called "cross rate" with the West German currency has been playing center stage in the foreign exchange market since the Bank of England, for the first time in more than a year, let the pound rise above 3.00 marks Monday. 

   Previously, the British central bank maintained a tight cap on the pound's value by intervening in currency markets to sell sterling, thus reducing its exchange rate and thereby helping British exporters. 
But British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Tuesday that the Bank of England wouldn't intervene or cut interest rates to weaken sterling because of concerns about inflation heating up in Britain's buoyant economy. 

   In Washington, Treasury Secretary Baker voiced support for the shift in British monetary policy, saying that the change reflected monetary policy considerations within Britain and in relation to other currencies in the European Monetary System, an eight-currency exchange rate mechanism centered on the mark. 

   Mr. Baker's remarks to the congressional Joint Economic Committee removed some speculation about British monetary policy. 
Mrs. Thatcher's statement Tuesday had prompted speculation that the monetary policy was shifting from the Group of Seven's agreement on exchange-rate stability. 
The Group of Seven nations -- Britain, the U.S., West Germany, Japan, France, Canada, and Italy -- reaffirmed the agreement last December. 

   Mr. Baker said the Thatcher statement isn't "in any way" contrary to the Group of Seven agreement and that Britain remains "fully committed" to the accord. 

   With relatively high interest rates and a booming economy in Britain, traders predicted the pound's rally will carry sterling still higher against the West German currency, to 3.10 marks. 
"This is not over. 
We have to try 3.10 (marks) to see if the Bank of England is there" to stem sterling's rise, said Francoise Soares-Kemp, treasury vice president at Credit Suisse, New York. 

   But some market participants began expressing wariness about sterling's outlook. 
"It has the potential to disappoint people very quickly. 
There's a lot of speculative buying," said Jeff Mondschein, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York. 
Speculators could rush out of the currency just as quickly as they came in it, he said. 
"There are also a lot of positions looking to take profits. 
Some people have been playing it since (sterling was) 2.96" marks, Mr. Mondschein added. 

   In other dealings, the dollar firmed to 1.6710 marks, from 1.6674, and to 128.15 yen, from 127.85. 
In early Tokyo trading Thursday, it opened at 128.25 yen. 

   Traders said the dollar avoided a possible pitfall from the Super Tuesday voting results. 
A strong showing by Rep. Richard Gephardt, which didn't occur, could have put the dollar under heavy pressure because his views were considered protectionist and harmful to the economy. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 90 cents an ounce to $436.20 in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 2.8 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $435.70 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Sterling Surges, Causing Action By Central Bank --- Bullish Report in London Is Cited in Sharp Rally; Dollar Climbs Slightly </HL>

   A bullish article on sterling by a Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. economist in London was cited in yesterday's sharp rally by the British currency. 

   The pound surged 1.1% to stand at $1.8815 in late New York trading, from $1.8605 Friday, and climbed 1.3% to 3.16 marks, from 3.12 in heavy trading. 

   The pound's sudden rally prompted the Bank of England to intervene in foreign exchange trading by selling sterling for dollars, and thus capping the British currency's rise for the time being. 
But traders and economists continued to voice optimism for the pound. 

   In other trading, the dollar firmed slightly. 

   The article cited by many traders for kicking off Monday's rally appeared in the Sunday Times of London and was written by Goldman Sachs's London-based chief international economist, David Morrison, an influential exchange-rate forecaster. 
In a recent report, Mr. Morrison said the pound could rise to $2 within six months and reach the 3.2-mark level in the same period. 

   According to traders, the market reacted to a reassertion of that forecast in the Sunday article and a statement that British exporters could tolerate even higher sterling exchange rates. 
A stronger currency makes British exports more costly for foreign consumers. 

   The article reinforced strong bullish sentiment toward sterling already established in the market. 
Because of a strong economy and relatively high interest rates, the pound has been a darling among currency traders this year. 
"A lot of (economic) fundamentals are in favor of the U.K. 
This trend could possibly continue," Cynthia H. Johnson, vice president of foreign exchange at Lloyds Bank PLC's New York unit. 

   Britain's high interest rates have become particularly attractive to traders recently because of the dollar's stability in the market. 
Unable to profit from the dollar's volatility, traders have bought sterling to earn its higher yields. 
Yesterday, three-month Eurosterling deposits yielded 8 5/16%, in contrast to 7 3/8 for similar dollar investments, and 3 9/16% for three-month Euromark deposits. 

   "Investors still like to buy sterling and hold it," said Antonio Bustamante, global foreign exchange manager at Marine Midland Bank, New York. 

   In Mr. Morrison's most recent monthly economic report for Goldman Sachs, U.K. economic growth for this year is estimated at 3.6%, in contrast to a 1.8% forecast for West German economic expansion, and 2.2% for the U.S. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $3.60 an ounce to $447.30 in light trading. 
The estimated volume was 1.2 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $447.40 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 124.75 yen.

<HL> Currency Markets: High-Yielding Currencies Rise As Dollar Drops --- Australia, Britain Intervene To Try to Stem Increases In Their Monetary Units </HL>

   High-yielding currencies continued surging yesterday, prompting the British and Australian central banks to intervene in foreign exchange markets to restrain the rise of their currencies, dealers said. 

   The dollar was slightly weaker against most other major currencies. 
However, according to some dealers, the dollar is benefiting indirectly from so-called cross-trading between non-dollar currencies. 
Cross-trading has increased recently as part of the general movement into such high-interest rate currencies as the British pound and the Australian dollar, from such relatively low-yielding currencies as the West German mark and yen. 

   The dollar lost the most ground to the pound, as the British currency climbed 0.3% to stand at $1.8375 in late New York trading, from $1.8315 Tuesday. 
Of more concern to British monetary authorities, however, was sterling's rise against the mark following sharp gains over the past two weeks. 
The stronger pound hurts British exporters by making U.K. goods more expensive abroad. 

   In early London trading the Bank of England sold sterling, according to traders, as the pound climbed to 3.11 marks. 
By late New York trading, sterling was quoted at 3.1063 marks. 
That was still up 0.2% from 3.0987 Tuesday. 

   In New York, traders said the U.S. Federal Reserve, acting on behalf of the Reserve Bank of Australia, sold Australian dollars in the market to turn back the currency's advance. 
The Australian dollar stood at 73.96 U.S. cents in late New York trading yesterday, down from 74.18 U.S. cents Tuesday. 

   The Canadian dollar, another currency offering high yields, continued to rally, climbing to 80.43 U.S. cents, from 80.25 U.S. cents. 

   Higher interest rates for deposits of these currencies make them more attractive to hold than other currencies, and increase the demand for them. 
The yields on three-month Eurocurrency deposits are 8.63% for sterling, 10.31% for Australian dollars, and 8.5% for Canadian dollars. 
These rates stand in sharp contrast to yields for similar deposits of 6.84% for dollars and 3.38% for marks. 

   "There's a great deal of demand for these currencies and that (upward) pressure will probably continue," said Albert Soria, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Swiss Bank Corp., New York. 

   In other trading, the dollar eased slightly to 1.6905 marks, from 1.6919, and to 126.75 yen, from 127.05. 

   In Tokyo, the dollar opened Thursday at 126.75, below its quote of 127.15 yen at the end of Wednesday's Tokyo session. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.40 an ounce to $451.10 in heavy trading. 
The estimated volume was six million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $451.80 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Sterling Gains Erased by Talk Of Intervention --- Profit-Taking Also Stalls Rally Linked to Budget; Dollar Posts Increases </HL>

<CO> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPAN </CO>

   Profit-taking and rumored central bank intervention reversed a brief but sharp rally in sterling yesterday immediately after the British government released its budget proposal. 

   The pound began soaring around midday New York time as British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson presented the U.K. government's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning in April. 
As Mr. Lawson concluded his remarks, the pound was already under selling pressure from traders taking profits on the currency's quick runup. 

   "It wasn't exactly a quiet day," said John I. Shupe, the sterling trader at Royal Bank of Canada, New York. 

   In late New York trading the pound stood at $1.8455, off 0.3% from $1.8515 Monday. 
But the day's overall movement in exchange rates masked a hectic trading period during Mr. Lawson's budget speech in which the pound soared 0.5% to $1.86, from $1.8505 during the first 30 minutes of the chancellor's remarks. 

   Many London banks stopped quoting prices for sterling while they watched the speech on television, and many other U.S. banks withdrew from the market to await news service stories on the budget plan, which channeled most trading through the broker market. 

   Against the mark, the pound climbed to an intraday high of 3.0930 marks, from 3.0827 Monday, before falling back to 3.0838 late in New York. 

   A bullish British budget for fiscal 1989 was generally expected by market participants, who had been bidding sterling higher over most of the past two weeks partly in anticipation of the news. 
The actual budget proposal, however, was interpreted by many traders as being more positive for sterling than earlier speculation. 

   Michael D. Andrews, vice president and foreign exchange economist at Irving Trust Co., New York, said the projection of a larger-than-expected budget surplus "is an indication of the economy's overall health." 
He added that the absence of government borrowings will increase the demand and prices for existing British government bonds, or gilts, attracting foreigners seeking capital gains potential. 
"Foreigners will have to buy sterling to buy gilts," Mr. Andrews said, explaining the bullish impact on the pound. 

   Mr. Lawson's forecast of a government surplus of #3 billion ($5.54 billion) for fiscal 1989 exceeded market expectations of a #2 billion surplus. 

   Sterling's slide yesterday came almost as quickly as its rise. 
"What we saw was profit-taking. 
People had some very nice profits in the cross positions," said Cynthia H. Johnson, vice president and corporate foreign exchange manager at Lloyds Bank PLC, New York, referring to trades between sterling and marks. 

   The wave of selling also prompted rumors that the Bank of England intervened in the market to stem sterling's rise. 
A spokesman at the British central bank declined to comment on the rumors. 
The lack of confirmation of intervention did little to discourage selling on the fear that the Bank of England was blocking further appreciation of sterling. 
"I'd rather trade off of rumors than facts. 
By the time it's confirmed it doesn't matter anymore," said Royal Bank's Mr. Shupe. 

   Last week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain wouldn't any longer intervene in foreign exchange markets to contain the pound's appreciation because of concerns about inflation. 
The Bank of England's intervention against the pound tends to be inflationary because by selling sterling in the foreign exchange market, it increases the money supply. 
Despite the policy announcement, many traders are wary of the Bank of England attempting to thwart the pound's rise if the currency nears 3.10 marks. 

   In other dealings, the dollar firmed against the major currencies. 
Traders attributed the rise to position-squaring ahead of tomorrow's report on U.S. merchandise trade. 
The dollar climbed yesterday to 1.6710 marks, from 1.6650, and to 127.45 yen, from 126.90. 

   The dollar opened Wednesday in Tokyo at 127.38 yen, up from 127.25 yen in closing trading Tuesday. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $4.40 an ounce to $446.30 in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 3.2 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $446.20 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.

   The dollar was mixed against most major currencies in light trading yesterday as dealers awaited the latest word on the U.S. economy and monetary policy, scheduled for tomorrow. 

   Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker are scheduled to testify before separate Senate panels tomorrow, and comments by either official could move currency rates, traders said. 
"People want to see whether Volcker and Baker are dancing to the same tune," said Peter Rogers, vice president and chief foreign-exchange dealer at Banca Nazionale Dell'Agricoltura, New York. 

   Mr. Baker recently has maintained that "the market" should determine proper exchange rates between major world currencies. 
Previously, Mr. Baker led the effort to weaken the dollar to increase the competitiveness of U.S. goods in international markets, and many speculators believe he still seeks a lower dollar. 
Mr. Volcker, meanwhile, frequently has voiced concern about a sharp decline in the dollar and its potential inflationary impact as imports become more expensive for Americans to buy. 

   The Commerce Department is scheduled to release tomorrow revised gross national product figures for the final quarter of 1986. 
Traders and analysts generally are looking for a modest upward revision of the 1.7% growth rate originally reported. 
"A slight upward revision will have no effect, but a large downward revision would be detrimental for the dollar," Mr. Rogers said. 

   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8178 West German marks, down from 1.8210 in late London dealings Monday. 
New York trading was idle Monday for the Washington's birthday holiday. 
The dollar also eased yesterday to 153.40 Japanese yen, from 153.55, but firmed to 1.5368 Swiss francs, from 1.5355. 
The British pound climbed to $1.5290, from $1.5213. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 153.43 yen from 153.40 in New York yesterday afternoon. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $5.70 an ounce to $392.10 in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 3.8 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $393.15 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Pound Surges, Despite Fed's Move to Curb It --- Britain, Clarifying Policy, Says Rein on Currency Is Looser; Dollar Falls </HL>

   The British pound continued its surge in foreign-exchange trading yesterday but ran into resistance from the U.S. Federal Reserve. 

   The dollar, meanwhile, fell in moderately active New York trading despite the Fed's attempts to prop it up and limit the pound's gains. 

   According to dealers at several New York banks, the Fed sold #70 million ($131.8 million) of the British currency in afternoon trading after sterling climbed to its intraday highs of $1.8825 and 3.1250 West German marks. 
The intervention against the pound was probably done on behalf of the Bank of England, which was concerned with the market's new rush to the British currency, traders said. 

   In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.8755, up 0.5% from $1.8660 late Tuesday. 
Over the past two weeks, the pound has gained 2.8% against the dollar after an announced shift in British monetary policy made the fight against inflation the top priority. 

   The pound's latest gains followed remarks made in London by Britain's top financial official. 

   Speaking to a parliamentary panel, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson confirmed that Britain had abandoned tight management of the pound's value and indicated that the currency might be allowed to rise further. 
His comments appeared to end a period of confusion over British exchange-rate policy that had disturbed the currency markets. 

   The pound soared after Mr. Lawson's remarks. 
Britain had been striving for about a year to keep the currency below 3.00 West German marks to try to keep British exports competitive in European markets. 
It stopped defending that level early this month, but Britain's new stance hadn't been clear to foreign-exchange traders before yesterday. 

   The pound closed yesterday in London at 3.1227 marks, compared with 3.1077 marks a day earlier. 

   The new British strategy apparently means British interest rates will remain relatively high. 
That is attracting a huge flow of capital into sterling as investors seek higher yields than are available in the U.S., West Germany or Japan. 

   Mr. Lawson, whose job is analogous to that of Treasury secretary in the U.S., said sterling's stabilization over the past year ended a six-year decline in the currency that had threatened to undermine Britain's fight against inflation. 
The pound's value averaged 2.94 marks last year, compared with 4.56 marks in 1981. 

   Today's stable to slightly firmer pound helps British exporters keep their prices steady and indirectly holds down costs throughout the entire domestic economy, Mr. Lawson said. 

   He suggested that sterling might be allowed to rise still further, saying, "It may be that we become so successful that we can have a gradually appreciating exchange rate." 

   Traders in the U.S. said yesterday's Fed intervention didn't seem aimed at stopping the pound's rise completely. 

   "It's just slowing down any movements, keeping the rise in an orderly fashion and from getting out of hand," John I. Shupe, the sterling dealer at Royal Bank of Canada, New York, said. 

   Meanwhile, despite the reported Fed activity, the dollar stood in late New York trading yesterday at 1.6635 marks, down from 1.6690 marks late Tuesday, and at 125.10 Japanese yen, off from 125.25 late Tuesday. 

   In midmorning Tokyo trading Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 125.25 yen. 

   One dealer at a major bank said the dollar eased in part because of a large order to buy currency futures placed on Chicago's International Monetary Market by a major Chicago-based commodities house. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.40 an ounce to $457.80 in heavy trading. 
Estimated volume was 7.5 million ounces.

   The British pound surged more than 1% against major currencies in response to the British government's new budget. 

   Sterling's advance was especially significant, traders said, because it coincided with a drop in British interest rates following yesterday's formal proposal of the fiscal 1988 budget. 
Lower interest rates tend to reduce demand for the currency. 

   "You'd expect sterling to come down but it hasn't," said Giles Tayelor, a trader at Barclays Bank International Ltd. in New York. 
"That means sterling is fairly strong, and is likely to stay that way for a while." 

   The dollar was narrowly mixed in foreign exchange trading, as the din of sterling activity drowned out most other dealings. 

   In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.6043, just shy of its intraday high and 1.1% above its Monday price of $1.5870. 
Sterling advanced similarly against the West German mark, the bellwether European currency, climbing to 2.9421 marks from 2.9106. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar inched up against the Japanese currency to 151.80 yen from 151.78 in New York Tuesday. 

   Partly in anticipation of Britain's annual budget proposal, the pound generally strengthened in recent weeks. 
Traders were optimistic that the budget would call for tax cuts and reduced government borrowing, as it did. 

   But Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget deficit projection yesterday of the equivalent of $6.4 billion was sharply narrower than market estimates and the government's earlier target. 

   Mr. Lawson also predicted economic growth of 3% this year, up from 2.5% in 1986. 

   "The market views the budget as being fairly prudent, very positive," said Valerie J. Walker, head of the New York foreign-exchange advisory office of Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank. 
"The prognosis for sterling as an investment currency looks fairly good," she said. 

   Although traders are optimistic about the pound, some caution that a rally might falter on a further drop in British banks' basic lending rate, which recently fell half a percentage point to 10 1/2%, selling tied to profit-taking or possible intervention by the Bank of England. 
The pound is "not going to go roaring away. 
It's just going to stay well bid," said Geoffrey Dennis, international economist at James Capel &amp; Co., a London broker. 

   And Mr. Tayelor of Barclays advised: "Expect sterling to stay at these levels or slightly better for some time." 

   In other foreign-exchange activity, the dollar eased to 1.8339 marks, from 1.8340, and firmed to 151.78 Japanese yen, from 151.55. 

   The dollar was lifted in midday trading by bullish interpretation of remarks by Treasury Secretary James Baker. 
Speaking before a House panel, Mr. Baker said last month's agreement in Paris among the U.S. and its top five economic allies "should foster more stability in exchange rates around their current values." 
He didn't elaborate. 

   Traders said the comment indicates that Mr. Baker still endorses the three-week-old accord by the so-called group of six. 
The pact is widely believed to call for coordinated central-bank intervention to keep the dollar confined to a narrow range. 
Traders believe it is near the low end of the acceptable range. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery rose 20 cents an ounce to $405.70 in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was three million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $405.90 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.

Ready to Weigh Joining

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's reelection revives speculation over whether Britain will join the European Monetary System. 

   But a decision is probably months away, currency traders and economists say. 

   Some leading cabinet members in the Conservative Party government favor British membership in the eight-currency system of managed exchange rates. 
But Mrs. Thatcher has blocked Britain's entry ever since the system was established in 1979. 
In the wake of her third consecutive election victory last week, Mrs. Thatcher may be more amenable to changing her mind, some analysts say. 

   "It's been on hold from a political standpoint and now will come up for consideration," Trevor W. Woodland, vice president, foreign exchange, at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, Chicago, says. 

   David Morrison, vice president and chief international economist at Goldman Sachs International Corp., London, says membership will be "the major policy issue being discussed over the next few months in Britain." 
He sees a 60% chance that Britain will join. 

   "I'm penciling it in for September or October," he says. 

   The main reason for joining would be to bring exchange-rate stability between Britain and its main trading partners in Europe. 
With Europe receiving about 60% of British exports compared with the 10% bound for the U.S., sterling's relation to European currencies such as the West German mark is vital. 

   The mark is the financial anchor in the EMS, which also includes the currencies of France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland. 

   "The competitiveness of British exporters is a key issue," Geoffrey Dennis, international economist at James Capel &amp; Co., a London brokerage firm, says. 

   For that reason, Britain might want to join when the pound's value against those European currencies is below current levels. 
A weaker pound would make British goods less expensive for other Europeans. 

   Mr. Dennis and others predict that after a post-election rally takes the pound somewhere above three West German marks, the currency will weaken to 2.85 marks by year's end. 
At that point, "we could just slide into the EMS," Mr. Dennis says. 

   Membership also might reduce the exchange-rate risk associated with sterling and thus help attract more foreign investment to Britain, analysts say. 
That in turn could lead to higher prices for British government securities, or gilts, and lower British interest rates, providing another boost to the economy. 

   By eliminating sterling's downward spikes, which make imports more expensive, managed exchange rates also could help control inflation, EMS advocates say. 

   "It's a legitimate case (for joining), but that doesn't mean Mrs. Thatcher will go for it," Goldman's Mr. Morrison says. 

   There are a number of reasons. 

   Joining would mean ceding some control over monetary policy to outsiders, chiefly West Germany, around which the current system revolves. 
"In effect, it passes some independence over to the Bundesbank," the West German central bank, Mr. Dennis says. 

   And membership can get expensive. 
In a currency crisis, the Bank of England might have to spend heavily through currency market intervention to keep the pound's value within the limits that the EMS sets. 
Another collapse of oil prices, for instance, could easily trigger such a scenario for Britain, a major exporter of North Sea crude. 

   Moreover, if Britain faced a prolonged problem with the pound while it was close to or in a recession, the Bank of England might have to boost interest rates to stabilize the currency -- and that probably would kill off any economic growth. 

   "You may have to make unpalatable decisions to raise interest rates at just the wrong time," Mr. Dennis says. 

   The first clue to Britain's intentions could come this month, when Mrs. Thatcher spells out her objectives for her third term in a ritual known as the queen's speech. 
The speech is prepared by the prime minister but read by the queen. 

   Because Mrs. Thatcher "has had such a major win in the election, she's going to have to be convinced" of the EMS's merits, Mr. Morrison says.

   Friday's Currency Activity
   A slight improvement in April's U.S. trade deficit and a smaller-than-expected rise in the producer price index for May helped the dollar strengthen against most major currencies. 

   Although the stronger dollar pressured sterling, the British pound rose against most other currencies after the ruling Conservative Party won a strong new parliamentary majority in Thursday's general election. 

   In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8105 West German marks, compared with 1.7920 late Thursday. 
The U.S. currency also climbed to 143.98 Japanese yen from 142.33. 
The pound eased to $1.6566 from $1.6630, but it rose to 3.00 marks from 2.98. 

   Dealers said news that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $13.32 billion in April from $13.63 billion in March prompted short-covering by players expecting a more bearish figure. 

   More heartening, dealers said, was a 0.3% increase in May's producer price index after a 0.7% rise for April. 
The market had been expecting about a 0.5% increase for May. 
Dealers said the smaller rise eased inflation fears, which helped the dollar and the U.S. bond market. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $9.10 an ounce to $454.60 in brisk trading. 
Estimated volume was five million ounces.

<HL> Currency Markets: British Banks Raise Base Rate To Help Pound --- Increase Is Second in 4 Days; West German Bank Sold Huge Amount of Dollars </HL>

   Major British banks raised their base rates one-half percentage point to 8.5%, the second boost in four days, as U.K. authorities scrambled to stanch the pound's recent decline. 

   Separately, West Germany's central bank reportedly exchanged at least $2 billion for marks through covert channels in the foreign-exchange market in the last week of May. 

   A further increase in U.K. base rates had been expected since Friday's boost to 8% from 7.5%, their lowest level in a decade. 
Interbank credit markets had already discounted an additional one-half percentage point jump by midday, when the Bank of England signaled the latest rise by again lifting one of its main money-market intervention rates. 

   Within an hour, Barclays PLC, Lloyds Bank PLC and the London unit of Citicorp increased their base rates. 
The Barclays boost took effect immediately, while the other two banks' moves were effective at the close of business. 
Similar increases by National Westminster Bank PLC and Midland Bank PLC go into effect today. 
Base rates are the benchmark for commercial lending in Britain. 

   The pound was relatively stable before and after the adjustment -- a marked contrast with last week's rate boost that came amid tumult in foreign-exchange markets. 
After opening weaker at about 3.0875 marks from Friday's close of 3.0991 marks, the pound edged slightly above 3.10 marks in listless morning dealing. 
The base-rate increase lifted the British currency to 3.105 marks but it skidded to 3.0933 marks in late trading. 

   A Bank of England spokesman said Monday's action followed "an overall assessment" based on a range of economic factors that "pointed to the need for a further rise in interest rate." 

   He declined to elaborate. 

   Traders and economists fretted that the pound's lingering weakness could drive U.K. base rates up again soon. 
"It's still too early to put a floor on the downside for sterling," said Derek Walker, a Midland Bank economist. 
"If sterling remains soft -- consistently below 3.10 marks -- there is a chance of another rate rise." 

   Gavyn Davies, chief U.K. economist for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in London, was more confident that the present level of exchange rates and interest rates could stand in the continuing "cat-and-mouse game between the authorities and the (foreign-exchange) markets." 
The rate increases restore earlier differentials between British rates and lower rates prevailing in the U.S. and West Germany, he said. 

   Other analysts said the gradual narrowing of the rate gap was one reason for the pound's sudden fall last week. 
With the gap closing, sterling-denominated investments appeal less to investors. 

   Exchange rates stand at the same level as last March, when banks cut their base rates to 8.5%, Mr. Davies said. 
That combination was acceptable enough to provide extended exchange-rate stability earlier this year, he added. 
The combination may work again. 

   In West Germany, the Bundesbank said its net monetary reserves fell to 95.9 billion marks ($55.56 billion), down 3.4 billion marks, in the week ended May 31, almost exclusively from foreign-currency sales. 
As most of the central bank's foreign reserves are in dollars, the drop reflected a massive unwinding of dollar positions it had built in support of the U.S. currency in the past two years. 
Because currency transactions are booked with a two-day delay, some of the dollar sales weren't included in its weekly statement, the Bundesbank said. 

   Dealers said they were stunned by the volume of the sales and the discretion with which the central bank managed to undertake the transaction. 
Observers were unable to confirm any of the interventions outside the fixing, as the central bank apparently used back channels and swore its partners to secrecy, they said. 

   Dealers said they were also surprised by the dollar's strength last week in light of the Bundesbank's massive sales. 

   "It shows how bullish the market is on the dollar," said Michael Schnirel, a foreign-exchange dealer at Irving Trust Co. in Frankfurt. 

   Without the Bundesbank's interventions, the dollar might have moved up even higher, other dealers added. 

   Analysts said the bank was taking advantage of the dollar's strength since midMay to reverse earlier currency interventions, which had bloated money supply. 

   By linking the small, but open dollar sales at the fixing with the massive covert transactions, the Bundesbank helped reinforce the myth of its own market power, said Giles Keating, economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. 
"They wanted to create the impression that the limited interventions at the fixing had a strong impact on the market sentiment," he said. 
"With that, they were successful." 

   Foreign-exchange dealers and analysts said they expect the Bundesbank to continue its dollar sales in coming days. 
The central bank is believed to hold an estimated 45 billion marks in dollar reserves in its accounts, far more than it would like to hold, dealers said. 

   In late afternoon New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.7136 marks from 1.7278 marks Friday. 
It fell to 125.78 yen from 125.98 yen. 

   In midmorning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 125.62 yen. 

   On New York's Commodity Exchange Monday, current-delivery gold settled at $462.90 an ounce, down $1.90. 
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.2 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $464.40 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.

<HL> U.S. Dollar Climbs Above Recent Range;
Sterling Continues Rise Despite Rate Cut

<DATELINE> The U.S. dollar rose against most currencies yesterday  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   breaking out of its recent narrow trading range -- aided by the surging British pound. 

   Sterling continued to gain even though British commercial banks announced a cut in their base lending rate. 

   For the near term, many traders said they are bullish on the pound and cautiously optimistic about the dollar. 

   "The propensity is for the dollar to move up here," said Alan Rose, senior vice president and foreign-exchange manager at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles. 
"Sterling's strength and the (West German) mark's weakness are usually a bullish indicator for the dollar." 

   In discussing the dollar's recent rise, traders cited Friday's better-than-expected February U.S. employment data, which contrasted with the string of relatively weak reports about West Germany's economy. 
"Right now, Germany doesn't look that great any more, and that's being reflected in the market," said Peter Wild, vice president of foreign exchange at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co., New York. 

   The dollar is also being carried along by the pound's rally, traders said. 
Some of sterling's biggest gains recently have come against the mark, and the flow of capital from marks into sterling is often accomplished through transactions involving the dollar. 
These transactions tend to strengthen the U.S. unit against the West German currency while weakening it against the pound, because in converting marks into sterling, traders often sell the mark to buy dollars and then use dollars to buy sterling. 

   The dollar climbed 0.8% yesterday against the West German unit, to 1.8595 marks from 1.8453, breaking out of its recent narrow trading range. 
The currency had traded narrowly because of market expectations of intervention, which stemmed from last month's agreement by the six largest industrialized nations to try to stabilize exchange rates. 

   Continuing last week's trend, sterling was strongest against its European counterparts as investors sought out Britain's relatively high interest rates and comparatively robust economy. 
In late New York trading, the pound stood at 2.9534 marks, up about 1% from 2.9254 Friday. 
The pound firmed to $1.5883 from $1.5853 Friday. 

   Some currency traders were surprised by the timing of yesterday's announced reduction in the base rate. 
Britain's major banks said they planned to cut the rate today, to 10.5% from 11%, after the Bank of England unexpectedly signaled yesterday that it favors such a cut. 

   The central bank lowered its key money-market intervention rates half a percentage point in late-morning trading. 
That prompted National Westminster Bank PLC, Britain's biggest bank, to announce a half-point base rate cut. 
Britain's three other major clearing banks -- Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC and Lloyds Bank PLC -- quickly followed National Westminster's lead. 

   A cut in the base rate theoretically makes sterling-denominated investments relatively less attractive, reducing demand for the currency. 

   Last week, the Bank of England tried to damp speculation about an imminent base-rate cut by lending funds to the money market at rates substantially above those set by the market. 
Yesterday, however, British authorities changed their minds about cutting interest rates after deciding that sterling's recent rise was firmly based "and more than a temporary blip," according to Treasury officials. 

   Soon after Britain's interest-rate announcement, the Bank of France reduced its seven-day repurchase rate to 8.5% from 8.75%. 
The repurchase rate generally sets the upper limit for France's overnight-call money rate. 
Bank of England officials said the cuts weren't coordinated, although they conceded that the two central banks "might have been aware" of the other's move. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery fell $1.20 an ounce to $405 in light trading estimated at two million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $405 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.

Pound, Dollar
Decline a Bit;
Trading Is Quiet

   The British pound's rally paused, and the U.S. dollar also eased in quiet foreign exchange trading yesterday. 

   Trading was subdued by concern about possible central-bank intervention to prevent exchange rates for both the pound and dollar from venturing beyond the levels of recent dealings. 

   Anxiety about central-bank intrusion into currency markets is caused by last month's exchange-rate stabilization agreement among the U.S. and its top five economic allies, traders said. 
Most major currencies have traded in a relatively narrow band since the accord by the Group of Six, or G-6, was announced in Paris Feb. 22. 

   "Despite everyone's expectations that the market would challenge the G-6's supposed ranges of tolerance, the test of their resolve isn't any closer than it was a month ago," said James S. Vick, vice president and senior corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. 

   While overall foreign-exchange activity was light yesterday, trading in sterling, and especially between sterling and West German marks, continued to dominate the market, dealers said. 

   "The market is moribund. 
It's difficult to see what's going to shake the dollar out of the doldrums. 
The only action is in sterling and sterling-Deutsche mark," said Peter Rogers, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer at Banca Nazionale Dell'Agricoltura in New York. 

   Sterling lost ground yesterday as it encountered relatively heavy corporate selling and traders who were reluctant to buy the currency for fear of intervention by the Bank of England. 
Concern about the central bank selling pounds was raised Wednesday after Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, reiterated his opposition to further strengthening of the pound. 
"Some people think the Bank of England is holding a sword over sterling, and that its potential is limited," Mr. Vick of Manufacturers Hanover said. 

   The pound was unaffected by the favorable news that Britain's unemployment rate fell to 11.1% in February from 11.3% in January. 

   In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.6003, down from $1.6080 Wednesday. 
Sterling also fell to 2.9338 marks, from 2.9513. 

   The dollar slipped to 1.8333 marks, from 1.8354, and to 151.48 Japanese yen, from 151.86. 

   The dollar's uneventful dealings were due to a lack of consensus about U.S. economic growth prospects, compared to the rest of the industrialized world, as well as to worries about central bank intervention, traders said. 
"You don't have any major reason to go in either direction," said Francois Soares-Kemp, vice president and chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais in New York. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 151.35 yen from 151.48 yen in New York yesterday afternoon. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery rose 20 cents an ounce to $405.30 in light trading. 
The estimated volume was 1.8 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $405.60 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.

   France Increases Reserves
   PARIS -- France continued an aggressive drive to boost its
foreign exchange reserves in the week ended March 12,
according to a weekly statement by its central bank.
   The Bank of France reported that its currency deposits
increased 6% to the equivalent of $19.79 billion, from $18.67
billion a week earlier. The bank's holdings of gold and
foreign currency rose 1.6% to the equivalent of $70.8
billion, the highest level in six months, from $69.69
billion.
   The figures tend to confirm speculation that France has
bought currencies heavily since reserves were depleted by
intervention to defend the franc before the currency's
devaluation within the European Monetary System Jan. 11.

   The dollar was mixed, climbing to its highest level in three months against the pound, edging higher against the yen, and surrendering some of its recent gains against the mark. 

   Traders said the widespread unwinding of long-sterling/short-mark cross positions pushed the pound sharply lower. 
To unwind the sterling-mark positions, traders had to buy marks, which boosted that currency against the dollar. 
A broad direct move out of sterling and into dollars contributed to the pound's weakness. 

   Bearish statements by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita about the dollar's long-term prospects and vague rumors of central-bank intervention in Europe also temporarily helped the mark. 

   In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7310 marks, down from 1.7328 marks late Tuesday, and at 125.43 yen, up from 125.23 yen. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar opened at 125.50 yen. 

   The pound was quoted Wednesday at $1.8136, down from $1.8360 late Tuesday, and at 3.1384 marks, down from 3.1800 marks. 
It was the lowest finish for the pound against the dollar since the close of $1.7745 on March 4. 

   The unwinding of sterling/mark cross positions was triggered by the short-term interest-rate parity between the U.S. and British currencies achieved in the past week or so. 
As the U.S. Federal Reserve snugged short-term U.S. rates, they caught up with and even surpassed rates that the Bank of England has been nudging lower to stem the pound's recent rise. 

   Many traders, however, said the pound's move lower was "overdone" and predicted a quick rebound. 

   The dollar inched higher against the yen as traders began to concentrate on a key currency which the dollar hasn't moved against since bullish U.S. trade data for March were unveiled May 17. 

   Traders said movement by the dollar against the yen is difficult because of large orders to sell dollars for yen as the dollar moves higher. 

   On New York's Commodity Exchange, June-delivery gold settled at $457.60 an ounce, up $2.60. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.6 million ounces.  en
   Gold was quoted at $456.90 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.

   The dollar firmed in thin trading as dealers generally sat out the session or squared positions ahead of today's report on the U.S. merchandise trade balance for August. 

   The trade report, widely considered the most influential piece of economic data for exchange rates, isn't expected to contain good news for the dollar, many market participants say. 
Estimates of the U.S. deficit for the month range from about $13 billion to $15.5 billion. 

   Although forecasts generally call for a narrowing from the record $16.47 billion gap reported for July, many dealers say that even a deficit at the narrower end of the predicted range wouldn't be a sign of strength for the dollar. 

   "If the number is good, how good could it be?" 
Douglas Madison, a corporate trader at BankAmerica International in New York, asked. 
"Overall market sentiment is overwhelmingly bearish" for the U.S. currency, he said. 

   There was little trading in New York yesterday, with most activity coming earlier in Asian markets. 
The dollar's highs and lows for the day were reached in Tokyo trading. 

   The U.S. currency first fell to an intraday low of 142.97 Japanese yen, triggering a burst of buying by investors who view 143 yen as an important short-term support level. 
Then a U.S. bank in Tokyo, believed to be operating on behalf of a New York investment house, bought as much as $2 billion against the yen, traders said. 
That pushed the dollar to its intraday high of 144.27 yen. 

   In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 143.89 yen, compared with 143.90 late Monday. 

   The dollar was quoted at 144.15 yen in early Tokyo trading today. 

   Yesterday's trading in Europe continued to focus on the British pound's strength and the West German mark's relative weakness. 
The Bank of England intervened in the market for the second consecutive day to try to keep sterling below 3.00 marks. 

   The pound "has the best economic house among the major traded currencies," John Lynam, vice president, foreign exchange, at Security Pacific National Bank, New York, said. 

   The pound is gathering support from recently stable oil prices and a relatively robust British economy, particularly compared with West Germany's sluggish growth. 

   The mark has come under additional pressure since Sunday's West German government announcement of a proposed 10% withholding tax on interest income. 
In the longer term, "that has to cloud the investment environment in West Germany," BankAmerica's Mr. Madison said. 

   The dollar stood at 1.8225 marks late yesterday in New York, compared with 1.8153 late Monday. 
The pound, meanwhile, continued to hover around 3.00 marks. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $2.60 an ounce to $459.10 in light trading. 
Estimated volume was 1.3 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $458.95 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.

   The dollar fell against most foreign currencies, and the West German mark moved sharply higher against its Continental European counterparts, in what dealers described as active but nervous trading. 

   Nearly all day, it looked as though the British pound's five trading-day gallop against the dollar had ended. 
But late in New York Thursday, sterling was bid up to $1.8460, slightly higher than the $1.8445 quoted late Wednesday. 

   Also in late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.6640 marks from 1.6710 marks Wednesday, and to 128.00 yen from 128.15. 

   The decline continued in early Tokyo trading, where the dollar opened at 127.85 yen. 

   After hitting an intraday high of $1.8477 in early Far Eastern trading, Britain's currency began falling on unfounded rumors that the Bank of England had placed orders to sell sterling. 
"It had the effect of inducing people to take profits or square positions," said Kenneth De La Salle, foreign exchange manager for National Westminster Bank in London. 

   Currency dealers were whipsawed by contradictory statements to Britain's Parliament by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. 
Mr. Lawson said sterling's recent rise against the mark was "unsustainable." 
Yet at the same time, the chancellor conceded that fighting inflation would remain at the "heart" of London's economic policy and that interest rates would be used to damp inflationary expectations. 

   Minutes later, Prime Minister Thatcher also said that battling inflation was of "paramount importance" and that occasionally "adjustments are needed" in any exchange rate system. 
Yet, referring to the pound's recent strength, she added that "there is no way to buck the market." 

   For more than a year, Britain maintained a policy of holding the pound below 3.00 marks, using aggressive intervention to do so when needed. 
The motive was to keep British exports competitive against the goods of its main European trading partners. 
But Monday the pound was allowed to rise above 3.00 marks. 
And on Tuesday, Mrs. Thatcher said the central bank wouldn't intervene nor cut interest rates to weaken sterling. 

   Now, "People are confused about the signals coming from political leadership in the U.K.," said Charles Minnaar, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank. 

   Sterling's rise has been mostly attributed to Britain's relatively high interest rates. 
For example, the three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for sterling is 8 15/16%, compared with 6 7/8% for U.S. dollars and 3 7/16% for marks. 
Libor is the rate at which major banks in London lend funds to each other. 

   At one point in yesterday's trading, the pound rose as high as 3.0850 marks before falling back to 3.0718 marks late in New York. 
Nevertheless, the British currency "is still well bid," said Robert Hatcher, a vice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York. 

   Dealers attributed the pound's rebound in late New York trading to the dollar's softness against other currencies, as well as thin late afternoon markets, where one dealer said a $10 million or $15 million order could easily move exchange rates. 
With "no clear direction in the dollar, people will generally continue holding currencies with high yields," said Mr. Minnaar of Chase Manhattan. 

   Nonetheless, traders and others remain nervous, wondering at what level the Bank of England might intervene to stop sterling's rise. 
Many believe it could be around 3.10 marks. 
"They will intervene at some time," said Mr. De La Salle of National Westminster Bank. 
"But only to smooth it out, when sterling rises too rapidly. 
They will let the pound reach its own equilibrium." 

   Traders also expect next Tuesday's announcement of Britain's budget for the fiscal year beginning April 5 to signal the U.K. government's deficit targets, tax program and overall borrowing needs. 

   In other activity, the mark surged against its weaker counterparts -- particularly the French franc and Italian lira -- in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, of which the pound is not a member. 
Traders said the advance began when the Banque de France declined to quote prices on the so-called mark-franc cross rate to commercial banks. 

   Dealers read that as a decision not to defend the French currency, and investors who had sold marks for higher-yielding francs began unwinding their short mark positions. 
Others noted apprehension over the two-part French presidential elections April 24 and May 8. 
One dealer mentioned a market rumor of a large speculative order to buy marks and sell francs based on a belief that as-yet-undeclared French President Francois Mitterrand wouldn't run. 

   The franc fell to just above its preset floor against the mark in the EMS, raising speculation about whether the joint-float of eight continental currencies would have to be realigned before the French elections. 

   "I don't think anything will happen," said Roberto Bianchi, a vice president with Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. 
"But uncertainty increases as we get closer to the (French) election." 

   Meanwhile, traders attributed the dollar's stability against the yen to Japanese interest in keeping the dollar from falling further before the end of Japan's fiscal year at month's end. 
If the yen rises more than 15% from April 1 to March 31, big institutional investors in Japan could be forced to revalue their dollar portfolios and possibly have large losses. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $443.20 an ounce, up $7. 
Volume was very heavy at an estimated six million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $442.05 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.

   The dollar was mixed yesterday after rebounding from a sell-off in Europe that sent it to a five-month low against the West German mark. 

   Meanwhile, West German monetary officials said they wouldn't intervene to block a further slight decline in the dollar's value. 
The remarks by the officials, who didn't want to be identified, tend to support the belief of many currency traders that officials of major industrial nations have lowered the range of dollar exchange rates that they would find acceptable. 

   One West German official described the dollar's fall in Europe yesterday as "only a slight weakening, within reasonable ranges." 
He said, "No one here has much trouble with these levels." 

   Traders attributed the dollar's recovery yesterday largely to buying aimed at taking profits on oversold positions. 
But some said a repatriation of U.S. funds that had been invested in the Tokyo stock market helped push the currency up against the Japanese yen. 

   Because of falling U.S. interest rates, however, there was little optimism among traders about the dollar's outlook. 

   "The interest-rate differential is working against the dollar," Albert Soria, vice president, foreign exchange, for Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said. 
He was referring to the narrowing of the spread between yields on U.S. and foreign instruments that had favored dollar-denominated investments. 

   As was the case a week earlier when U.S. stocks suffered a record 22.6% decline, the dollar didn't react negatively yesterday as Wall Street took another pounding. 
While the Dow Jones Industrial Average was plunging 156.83 points, the dollar was climbing back from its intraday lows reached in European trading. 

   The dollar's initial fall yesterday was based on an assumption among currency traders that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain downward pressure on interest rates as long as the economy faces the threat of a collapsing stock market. 

   "With the stock market sell-off, there's no way the Fed is going to use short-term interest rates to defend the dollar," Jim O'Neill, financial markets economist in New York for Marine Midland Bank, said. 

   Lower interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated investments less attractive and to decrease demand for the dollar. 
There also is significant doubt that the U.S.'s major allies would ease their rates in step with the U.S., meaning that dollar investments' yield advantage would be further threatened. 

   The Swiss franc benefited most from the early dollar selling yesterday, as investors headed for the Swiss bond market, Mr. Soria of Swiss Bank Corp. said. 

   "It's strictly a flight to quality; I don't think investors want to go into any stock market right now," he said. 

   About midway through the European trading day, the dollar stood at 1.4565 Swiss francs, down 0.9% from 1.4693 late Friday in New York. 
Against the West German currency, it was at a five-month low of 1.7650 marks, down 0.7% from 1.7780 late Friday. 

   In late New York trading yesterday, after traders bought the currency to cover short, or oversold, positions, the dollar was quoted at 1.4656 Swiss francs and 1.7775 marks. 

   The dollar's performance against the yen was a slightly different story and involved more than profit-taking by currency speculators. 

   The U.S. currency recovered yesterday to stand at 142.50 yen late in the New York day, up 0.5% from 141.73 late Friday. 
Among those selling yen to buy dollars were U.S. mutual funds repatriating proceeds from sales on the Tokyo stock market, according to Eishi Wakabayashi, head of currency and bond trading at Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International Inc., the New York unit of a Japanese investment house. 

   "They think the Tokyo (stock) market is more overvalued than New York's, and there's a sense that they'd rather take their business home," he said. 

   The dollar also firmed against the British pound as sterling slipped to $1.6845 from $1.6850. 
Traders said the Bank of England intervened in European trading to buy dollars against sterling. 
The central bank declined to comment, but British monetary sources confirmed the purchases. 

   Traders said they believe the intervention was intended primarily to weaken the pound against the mark. 
For trade reasons, the sterling-mark relationship is currently more important to British authorities than the dollar rate. 
For some time, the Bank of England has sought to keep the pound below 3.00 marks. 
The pound eased yesterday to 2.9942 marks from 2.9959. 

   The West German Bundesbank bought $22.7 million at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing yesterday, but this wasn't considered a sizable intervention. 
There were no reports of West German central bank activity in the open market. 

   Meanwhile, Banque Nationale de Belgique sold a substantial amount of marks and bought Belgian francs at the Brussels foreign exchange fixing to try to shore up the Belgian currency. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.80 an ounce to $476.20 in brisk trading. 
Estimated volume was 4.5 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $475.85 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong. 

   The dollar was quoted at 142.27 yen in early Tokyo trading today.

   The dollar slipped yesterday in quiet dealings in which cross-trading between non-dollar currencies continued to dominate, traders said. 

   As the dollar remained confined in a narrow trading range, Japan's finance ministry proposed a sharp buildup of funds available for intervention in the foreign-exchange markets. 

   Traders have attributed the dollar's timid movements in recent days to fears of a reappearance of heavy, coordinated central bank support of the U.S. currency. 
Such intervention was seen earlier this month, with the Bank of Japan playing a key role. 

   The Japanese finance ministry in Tokyo yesterday submitted a budget proposal to parliament that requested raising the ceiling for offering foreign exchange fund bills to 28 trillion yen in fiscal 1988 from 19 trillion yen ($148.6 million) this fiscal year, which ends March 31. 
The finance ministry issues the short-term bills, maturing in 60 days, to raise funds it can use for intervention, when necessary. 
Parliament is expected to approve the request. 

   Japanese officials said the proposal is in line with an agreement among major industrial countries to conduct concerted currency market intervention to keep the dollar, the yen and other key currencies stable. 
The sharp increase appeared to demonstrate the government's determination to support the dollar if the U.S. currency starts declining again. 

   Earlier this month President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said they agreed on arrangements by which the U.S. would obtain Japanese currency for intervention purposes in support of the dollar. 
Central banks prop the dollar in foreign exchange markets by purchasing dollars with other currencies, primarily the West German mark and Japanese yen. 

   In December the Group of Seven industrial nations, including the U.S., Japan and West Germany, renewed commitments to stabilize dollar exchange rates through coordinated intervention. 
Large-scale dollar purchases by major central banks at the start of 1988 propelled the dollar sharply higher into its current trading range. 

   The dollar continued to bob and weave in a narrow band yesterday. 
"We're basically in a no-man's land," Robert K. Ryan, vice president of foreign exchange at Irving Trust Co., New York, said. 
"For the moment, the dollar seems to be locked in a zone. 
We trade up to one end and down to the other," he said. 

   In late New York dealings, the dollar stood at 1.6729 marks, off 0.6% from 1.6827 Monday. 
The dollar eased to 127.65 yen, from 128. 
The British pound firmed to $1.7745, from $1.7685. 

   In Tokyo, the dollar opened slightly lower at 127.50 yen Wednesday, compared with 127.55 yesterday. 

   Traders expect today's report from Washington on fourth quarter growth to show that the economy expanded at a rate between 3% and 4% during the period. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 20 cents an ounce to $469.10 in brisk trading. 
The estimated volume was five million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $470.85 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Sterling Climbs On Surge in Oil As Dollar Eases --- British Currency Overcomes Bad Trade-Deficit News; Canadian Dollar Rises </HL>

   Surging oil prices fueled a rally in sterling yesterday, while the dollar eased against most major currencies. 

   The British currency's gains came even though the pound had slipped earlier in the day on disappointing U.K. trade news. 
Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar rose in response to a report of strong economic growth in Canada and a bulge in corporate orders, traders said. 

   In European trading, the British pound was initially pressured lower on the release of worse-than-expected U.K. trade figures for January. 
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry reported that the nation's merchandise trade deficit widened to a record 1.51 billion pounds ($2.67 billion) in January, from 1.01 billion pounds in December. 

   The pound "took a beating on the release," one trader said, and fell to its lows of $1.7680 and 2.9880 West German marks in midday European trading yesterday. 

   By late New York trading, however, dealers were flocking back to the pound, attracted by a rally in oil prices, Britain's relatively high interest rates, and a belief that the sterling-mark exchange rate had hit especially attractive levels. 
"It shrugged off that bad trade figure," said Ian M. Spence, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York. 

   Sterling was quoted at $1.7740 in late New York dealings, up from $1.7720 Friday. 
The pound also was quoted at 2.9936 marks, off slightly from 2.9938 marks Friday, but up 0.2% from its intraday low yesterday, which is a relatively strong move against the West German currency. 

   Rising oil prices are considered bullish for sterling because of Britain's role as an oil exporter. 
Higher oil prices mean increased export revenue for the U.K., and boosts demand for sterling among importers of British crude. 

   Relatively high British interest rates remained an added attraction for traders yesterday. 
At 9.375% yesterday, three-month Eurosterling deposits were about three points higher than rates for similar dollar investments, and about six points above three-month mark deposit rates. 
Traders "tend to buy and hold high interest-rate currencies," especially when the dollar is stable, said Geoffrey N. Gowey, vice president of foreign exchange at Elders Finance, New York, a unit of Australian-based Elders IXL. 

   The Canadian dollar climbed to 79.46 U.S. cents Monday, from 79.10 Friday, following a government report that Canada's economy expanded at a robust rate of 6.0% in the 1987 fourth quarter. 
The Canadian dollar's rise also was supported by increased corporate demand based on concern that the currency will rise further. 
The Canadian dollar should "test" the 80-U.S. cent level this week, according to Trevor W. Woodland, vice president of foreign exchange at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, Chicago. 

   "If you're a U.S.-dollar buyer, right now is the time to sit back and see if (the Canadian dollar) can break 80 (U.S.) cents," Mr. Woodland said. 
"The Canadian dollar buyers have to be defensive. 
It's very hard in the short term to tell somebody that they should keep sitting back and waiting" for the Canadian dollar to drop back down, he said. 

   In other trading, the dollar eased to 1.6875 marks, from 1.6895, and dipped to 128.25 yen, from 128.35. 
In early trading Tuesday in Tokyo, it was quoted at 128.50 yen. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 90 cents an ounce to $430.50 in brisk trading. 
The estimated volume was 5.8 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $431.15 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.

Pound's Upward Momentum Continues
Despite Drop in British Lending Rates

   The British pound, lifted higher by the momentum of the recent rally in high-yielding currencies, continued to dominate foreign exchange trading yesterday. 

   Sterling's rise occured despite cuts in the basic lending rates of British banks yesterday, which resulted in lower yields on pound-denominated deposits. 
Traders believed that British interest rates are still much more attractive than those in the U.S., West Germany or Japan and that the rate cut ultimately will stimulate economic growth in the United Kingdom. 

   Sterling's rise was tempered by fears of central bank intervention and remarks yesterday by Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. 
Buttressing the pound, though, was optimism carried over from Mr. Lawson's annual budget message Tuesday, firmer oil prices and inactivity in the usually more important trading of dollars and West German marks. 

   The dollar edged higher in quiet trading yesterday. 

   "Dollar-sterling and sterling-mark, that's where all the action has been," said Victor Polce, vice president of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. 

   "Aside from sterling, this market has been lethargic," Mr. Polce said. 

   The reduction in British lending rates to 10% from 10.5% was largely expected. 
That decrease, though, was smaller than what some analysts had predicted a drop of a full point, which may account for sterling's strength in the face of the cut. 
"It would take a drop of at least another percentage point to hurt the pound," said Robert Cassidy, vice president of foreign exchange at Chemical Bank in New York. 

   Also, the stimulative effect of the cuts on the British economy was seen as a positive sign for the pound, traders said. 

   The most negative factor for sterling, traders said, remains the specter of Bank of England intervention in currency markets to halt the pound's appreciation. 
Such fears were reinforced by Mr. Lawson's remarks to reporters in London yesterday. 
Although the finance minister said he was "perfectly content" with the pound's current level, Mr. Lawson reiterated that he wouldn't like to see a significant strengthening of the pound. 

   Sterling has risen about 5% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies since the Feb. 22 accord to stabilize exchange rates, struck by U.S. and its five major economic allies at their Paris meeting. 
The pound's trade-weighted value yesterday stood at 72.6% of its 1975 level, compared with 69.1% on the last trading day before the Paris accord. 

   Meanwhile, in late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.6080, up from $1.6043 Tuesday. 
Against the bellwether European unit, sterling climbed to 2.9513 marks, from 2.9421. 

   If Britain's central bank plans to intervene against the pound, it will start selling sterling at or above the $1.6100 level, many traders say. 
Britain may want a weaker currency to make its products less expensive for foreigners to import, traders note. 

   In other currency trading, the dollar rose to 1.8354 marks, from 1.8339, and to 151.86 Japanese yen, from 151.78. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar inched up against the Japanese currency to 151.88 yen from 151.86 in New York yesterday afternoon. 

   In New York, gold for current delivery fell 60 cents an ounce to $405.10 in moderate trading estimated at 2.3 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $405.50 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Pound Rises With Oil Prices, Mideast Tension --- British Currency Surpasses $1.90 for a 6-Year High; Dollar Generally Mixed </HL>

   The British pound climbed to a six-year high, spurred by increased oil prices and new hostilities in the Middle East. 

   The dollar was narrowly mixed against other major currencies. 
Traders said the dollar probably would have had a broad decline if not for the Mideast developments, which fueled interest in the U.S. currency as a haven for international investors. 

   "Most people think the dollar is going down because of the trade deficit," Ian M. Spence, chief foreign exchange dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said. 
However, he said, "Money seems to come to the U.S. during times of trouble. 
It's the old safe haven theory." 

   The investor concerns were triggered by a U.S. strike against two Iranian oil platforms and several Iranian vessels in the Persian Gulf yesterday, in retaliation for last week's mine attack that crippled a U.S. frigate. 
The events added to market nervousness about the region that already had been stirred by the Israeli-Palestinian clashes in the occupied West Bank. 

   Because Britain is an oil exporter, the pound strengthened as the worsening Middle East tensions lifted oil prices. 
The pound climbed to $1.9055 in intraday dealings, its highest level since January 1982. 
In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.9005, up 0.6% from $1.8895 late Friday. 

   The pound's sharpest gain came against the yen because of the vulnerability of the Japanese economy to any surge in oil prices, traders said. 
Japan imports nearly all its petroleum. 
The pound climbed 0.8% to 236.16 yen from 234.26. 

   Traders said sterling also continues to benefit from relatively high British interest rates. 
Sterling-denominated three-month Eurodeposits yielded 7 7/8% yesterday, compared with 4 1/16% for a similar yen-denominated investment. 
Although Britain's interest-rate advantage over the U.S. has narrowed recently, traders said sterling investments continue to be significantly more attractive. 

   For these reasons, sterling "is the strongest of the currencies right now and looks like it still wants to go higher," said John J. McCarthy, vice president, foreign exchange, at Irving Trust Co., New York. 

   According to traders, the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened to sell sterling against dollars yesterday, presumably on behalf of the Bank of England. 

   In other dealings, the dollar firmed to 124.26 yen from 123.98 and eased to 1.6605 marks from 1.6625. 

   In midmorning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 124.35 yen. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $3.40 an ounce to $459.40 in moderate trading. 
Estimated volume was three million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $458.60 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: U.K. Rules Out Intervention To Limit Pound --- Thatcher's Speech Removes Trader Concern; Sterling Rises 1.3% Against Dollar </HL>

<TEXT>
   The British pound's rally continued yesterday as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the government won't intervene to halt sterling's rise. 

   Mrs. Thatcher's statement to Parliament was chiefly intended to clarify British monetary policy. 
But it removed concerns among currency traders that the Bank of England might attempt to put a lid on sterling's value by selling pounds in the foreign exchange market. 

   With those fears doused, and with the attraction of relatively high British interest rates, traders renewed their rush into the currency. 
The pound climbed to $1.8424 in late New York dealings, up 1.3% from $1.8182 Monday. 
Meanwhile, the dollar eased against other European currencies but gained slightly against the yen. 

   The pound also advanced 0.8% to 3.0720 West German marks, from 3.0488. 
From Britain's perspective, the sterling-mark exchange rate is of more importance than the pound's dollar value because most British trade is with West Germany and Western Europe, where many currencies are linked to the mark. 

   Until this week, Britain had for more than a year used interest rates and foreign exchange market intervention to maintain the pound's value below three marks to encourage exports. 
A weaker pound makes British products less expensive for foreign consumers. 

   The decision to let the pound rise above three marks signaled that the British government is more concerned about fighting inflation than spurring exports. 
"Excessive intervention," Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons yesterday, "would lead to inflation, and that is no part of our policy." 
She added that a cut in British banks' base lending rates, currently 9%, also would be inflationary. 

   Selling sterling through intervention tends to be inflationary by increasing the money supply. 
Lowering interest rates would be an alternative way to reduce demand for sterling by lessening the appeal of holding the currency. 
But lower interest rates might also be inflationary by overstimulating the already robust British economy. 

   Mrs. Thatcher's remarks reflect the government's deepening concern about possibly inflationary pay settlements in Britain. 
But her statement carries implications stretching beyond British shores. 
Market economists note that the shift in British monetary policy may undercut the dollar's stability. 

   "The second biggest buyer of dollars in 1987 is saying: 'We're not doing it any more,'" said Jim O'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank in New York. 
"Can you imagine if the Japanese said the same thing?" 

   British government officials yesterday declined to say whether they informed Washington about their move away from large-scale intervention. 
But Britain's new policy probably will hold center stage today when senior officials of the 11 leading industrial nations meet in Paris to review the global outlook for currency stability. 

   In Washington, the Treasury wouldn't comment on Mrs. Thatcher's decision. 
But privately, administration officials were interpreting it as a British and European policy matter that doesn't imply any change in Britain's willingness to support the dollar under the Dec. 22 agreement by the Group of Seven countries. 

   "We have no reason to think the United Kingdom has changed its policy on the dollar in any way," an administration official declared. 
"All of the G-7 governments continue to support the Dec. 22 agreement." 
The official said neither Mrs. Thatcher nor Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had contacted the U.S. government to communicate any change in their willingness to back the dollar. 

   In the Dec. 22 communique the seven nations declared the dollar had fallen enough. 
And in the ensuing weeks, they intervened heavily in currency markets to prop it up against the Japanese yen and German mark. 
Britain isn't as important in these endeavors as the U.S., Japan, or Germany. 
And the dollar's value against the pound isn't considered a vital measure of currency stability by U.S. officials. 

   In other foreign exchange activity, the dollar fell against most major European currencies, slipping, for example, to 1.6674 marks from 1.6768. 
The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen to 127.85 from 127.79. 

   The dollar was quoted at 127.95 yen in early Tokyo trading Wednesday. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $2 an ounce to $435.30 in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 2.5 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $435.85 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.

   The British pound, leader of the recent rally in high-yielding currencies, is beginning to look too pricey, some foreign-exchange dealers say. 

   Although sterling isn't headed for a sharp downturn soon, several factors may stymie any significant advances, the dealers maintain. 

   "We don't see a lot of upside potential for sterling from here, but we don't think sterling is about to collapse either," says Geoffrey Dennis, international economist at James Capel &amp; Co., a London broker. 

   Supporting that view is the pound's performance in recent days. 
It reached a high point of $1.6050 in Friday's New York dealings, but couldn't sustain that level. 
And against the bellwether European currency, the pound hasn't been able to break 3.00 West German marks. 

   Other traders, though, remain bullish about sterling's near-term outlook. 
They cite Britain's continued high interest rates, even with the recent declines, its relatively good potential for economic growth and new optimism about the reelection of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party government. 
Mrs. Thatcher's political future is considered enhanced by the fiscal 1988 budget presented last week by her chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, which included tax cuts and reduced need for government borrowing. 

   But politics also figure in the less optimistic outlook for sterling. 
Last week Mr. Lawson said he was "content" with the pound's exchange-rate level but reiterated his opposition to a significant strengthening of the currency. 
A weak currency helps Britain's exporters by making their goods less expensive in world markets. 
So a threat of possible Bank of England intervention against the pound hangs over the market. 

   "Mr. 
Lawson's statement after the budget made it very clear; he doesn't want to see it much higher than this," Mr. Dennis says. 

   Britain's widely expected entry into the European Monetary System poses a longer-term threat to the pound, traders say. 
A devaluation of sterling, possibly to 2.80 marks, would precede Britain's admission to the joint float of eight currencies, many traders believe. 
The Conservative government is believed to favor entry if it survives the next election, which may be called as soon as this summer. 
Entry and sterling's devaluation are "a safe bet," says Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago. 

   Still, Britain's political stability, relatively robust economy and, above all, its still-high interest rates will continue to attract investors to the pound, other traders say. 
Yields on three-month sterling Eurodeposits stood at 9 5/8% Friday, in sharp contrast to 6 3/8% and 3 7/8% for similar dollar and mark deposits, respectively. 
"We're still looking for sterling at $1.65," says Anthony J. Murphy, a Royal Bank of Canada trader in New York. 

   But following the pound's appreciation of more than 3.5% against major currencies this month, "The level right now makes the attraction a lot less," Mr. Holzer says. 
"It's topping." 

   In late New York trading Friday, the pound stood at $1.6042, up from $1.6003 Thursday, but eased to 2.9333 marks, from 2.9338. 

   In other dealings, the dollar edged lower in sparse trading, slipping to 1.8285 marks, from 1.8333, and to 151.35 Japanese yen, from 151.48. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for March delivery rose 30 cents an ounce to $405.60 in moderate trading estimated at 2.2 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $406 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Dollar Climbs On Narrowing Of Trade Deficit --- Traders Say Profit-Taking Signals Bearish Outlook; U.K. Reduces Key Rate </HL>
<AUTHOR> Charles W. Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<CO> EUROP FREST JAPAN CANDA </CO>

   The dollar strengthened on the back of yesterday's report on U.S. merchandise trade that showed a smaller deficit for January than most analysts expected. 
But a sustained advance by the dollar remains unlikely, traders said. 

   Meanwhile, the Bank of England cut a key interest rate, prompting rate reductions by British commercial banks. 
Traders interpreted the action as a U.K. government attempt to contain the pound's recent surge, especially against other European currencies. 
But sterling continued to strengthen against the bellwether West German mark. 

   The Commerce Department's report that the U.S. trade gap widened to $12.44 billion in January, from $12.2 billion in December, confirmed the more optimistic forecasts and caught most currency traders by surprise. 
An average of estimates by economists surveyed by the Dow Jones News Service before the release placed the deficit at $12.8 billion, and many traders said they were looking for a figure between $13 billion and $14 billion. 

   The news lifted the dollar to 1.6915 marks in late New York trading, up 0.9% from 1.6765 Wednesday. 
The dollar climbed 0.8% to 128.65 yen, from 127.58. 

   In midmorning trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at 128.40 yen. 

   The dollar's rise was exaggerated, however, according to traders, because much of the demand for the U.S. currency yesterday came from speculators buying dollars to cover short, or oversold positions established before the trade report. 
These speculators were expecting a wider trade deficit for January, and that the dollar would fall. 

   "We all got caught and had to run for cover," said Peter Wild, first vice president and treasurer at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co., New York. 
"That was the big part of the (dollar's) move," he said. 

   Immediately after the 8:30 a.m. EST trade report, the dollar bounced up to 1.6850 marks and 128.30 yen, from 1.6750 marks and 127.40 yen before the release. 

   The dollar's rally was interrupted within an hour of the trade news by selling from traders taking quick profits on the currency's rise. 
Dealers interpreted the bout of profit-taking as another indication of bearish sentiment in the market and lack of confidence in the dollar's ability to sustain a rally. 

   "The dollar has a limited upside potential, and it remains more vulnerable on the downside," said David C. Redding, vice president of money market economics at Bankers Trust Co., New York. 

   After the round of profit-taking, the dollar slid back to 1.6733 marks and 127.70 yen. 

   Traders attributed their limited expectations for the dollar to factors other than trade, including the federal budget deficit and political uncertainty of an election year. 
And despite progress in closing the trade deficit over recent months, traders said the narrowing has been slow and halting and that the gap still remains wide. 
Although better than expected, the latest trade news "doesn't change the big picture" for the dollar's outlook, Robert Hatcher, vice president and corporate foreign exchange dealer at Barclays Bank PLC, New York, said. 
For the near term the dollar will likely trade in ranges between 1.67 and 1.71 marks and 127 and 130 yen. 
"Instead of trading at the lower end of the range, we'll trade at the upper end," Mr. Hatcher said. 

   In other trading, after a brief dip following British interest rate cuts yesterday, the pound resumed its advance against European currencies. 
Although the pound weakened against the dollar, along with most other major currencies, falling to $1.8333 late yesterday, from $1.8480, it climbed to 3.1010 marks, from 3.0982. 

   After the Bank of England cut its money market intervention rate a half-point, British commercial banks responded by lowering their base rates a half-point to 8.5%. 
The lower rates make sterling less attractive for foreign investors. 
But traders remained bullish on the pound because yields for sterling-denominated investments are still significantly higher than for investments denominated in dollars or marks, and the British economy is seen as robust. 

   Mr. Hatcher said the Bank of England's rate cuts appeared to be an attempt by Britain to keep the pound from rising too high. 
A stronger currency hurts British exporters by making their products more costly abroad. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.30 an ounce to $444 in brisk trading. 
The estimated volume was 4.5 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $444.20 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.

   The dollar was only slightly changed but mostly lower in lazy pre-holiday trading. 

   The currency kept to one of its narrowest daily ranges of the year. 
Such restrained activity may well continue for the rest of the summer, some dealers said. 

   "There's nothing at the moment to indicate a breakout of this market," Alfred Driever, vice president, foreign exchange, at Salomon Brothers Inc., New York, said. 

   From the beginning of yesterday's trading in Tokyo through late New York dealings, the U.S. currency crawled between 1.8195 and 1.8295 West German marks. 
Late in the day in New York, it stood at 1.8278 marks, barely higher than 1.8273 late Tuesday. 

   John W. Baker, chief foreign exchange trader for Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. in New York, said the dollar could remain trapped between 1.81 and 1.84 marks for the rest of the summer. 
"We have a summer trading range and the summer blues," he said. 

   Against other currencies, the dollar inched lower to 146.80 Japanese yen from 146.93 Tuesday. 
The British pound climbed to $1.6170 from $1.6138. 

   In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 146.92 yen. 

   Despite the dollar's recent stability, negative sentiment on the currency remains strong in the market. 

   "The fundamentals point to a lower dollar," Mr. Baker said, referring to the U.S.'s trade and budget deficits and sluggish economy. 
"But there's no point to selling the dollar. 
The upside is limited, but the downside is limited. 
People are hesitant to take large positions when there's no direction to the market." 

   Salomon's Mr. Driever said: "Most people believe the (eventual) push will be on the downside rather than the upside. 
But that's irrelevant right now because we're just range-trading." 

   In Tokyo, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will have to watch exchange rates carefully despite the dollar's recent stability. 
Mr. Sumita told a news conference that because the large trade imbalance between the U.S. and Japan remains basically unchanged despite a slight improvement, "we cannot keep our eyes off the exchange rates." 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $2.50 an ounce to $446.90 in moderate trading. 
Estimated volume was three million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $447.85 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.

   The dollar inched lower against most other major currencies in what traders described as one of the dullest trading days so far this year. 

   Vacation absences at trading desks and a lack of market-moving news kept volume to a minimum and limited the dollar's movement. 

   Although the U.S. currency weakened slightly, it remained well above its lows for the year. 
Traders said it appears well supported by technical and political factors for the time being. 
Next week's scheduled auction of one-year Treasury bills also is expected to attract Japanese investor interest, which would further underpin the dollar for the near term. 

   However, the lackluster performance of the U.S. economy dims any hope that the dollar might make a sustained show of strength much beyond the end of summer, many traders say. 

   "These are technical highs for the dollar, not fundamental highs," Ronald L. Sapiro, vice president and chief dealer at Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust Co., Chicago, said. 

   With the summer slowdown gripping the foreign-exchange market, some dealers said they prefer to avoid taking large positions until the normal level of liquidity returns in September. 
A relatively large order amid such thin trading, they said, could easily move the market against a fundamentally sound position. 

   Because of the lack of liquidity, bank dealers said they were only processing occasional orders from corporate clients yesterday and staying out of the usually active area of interbank trading for their own accounts. 

   Against the West German mark, the dollar moved in a narrow range from 1.8600 in Asian trading to 1.8537 in New York. 
In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8551 marks, barely lower than 1.8554 late Monday. 
It also eased to 150.45 Japanese yen from 150.63. 

   The dollar was quoted at 150.05 yen in early Tokyo trading today. 

   The dollar's strengthening early this summer created a base of support for it, according to technical analysts who chart exchange-rate movements to predict the next moves. 
Traders also see political support for the dollar stemming from agreements between the U.S. and its major allies to maintain exchange-rate stability. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $2.80 an ounce to $456.50 in heavy trading. 
Estimated volume was 5.8 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $457.50 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.

U.S. Unit's Narrow Range
Fixes Trader Attention
On the British Currency

   The British pound rose sharply against the U.S. dollar and most other major European currencies yesterday in an otherwise lackluster trading day. 

   The dollar was higher against most major currencies besides the pound, but it failed to break out of its narrow trading range of the past two weeks. 
The U.S. unit's recent sluggish movements against its major counterparts, combined with higher interest rates offered for sterling-denominated investments, were largely responsible for the pound's rise, dealers said. 

   "Sterling seems to be the only currency where there's any (investor) interest at all," said Trevor W. Woodland, a vice president at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, Chicago. 

   Sterling's strength also was attributed to trader optimism about the British political climate. 

   Recent inactivity in the usually dominant and more-volatile trading of dollars for West German marks helped divert attention to the pound, dealers said. 
They cited sharply decreased opportunities to make trading profits in their most liquid market. 
Trading activity and exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the mark have slowed since the six major industrialized nations announced an agreement last month aimed at stabilizing currency values. 

   With sterling-denominated investments yielding more than dollar-denominated ones, the pound became an attractive alternative. 
"The view is that if you have stable currency rates, then you cash in on the high-yield currencies," said Leslie A. Puth, a trader at Credit Suisse, New York. 

   Sterling three-month Eurodeposits yielded 10 5/8% yesterday, in contrast to 6 6/16% for similar dollar deposits and 4% for a like German mark investment. 

   In late New York trading yesterday, the pound stood at $1.5643, up 1.1% from $1.5480 Friday. 
And sterling's rise was sharper against its European counterparts. 
Against the bellwether West German unit, the pound surged 1.7% to 2.8741 marks, from 2.8263. 

   Mr. Woodland of Harris Trust also cited "a reduced intervention risk" in selling dollars for pounds. 
Some participants in last month's Paris meeting of finance ministers from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada have said their agreement to stabilize rates includes plans for intervention to oppose any sudden moves in dollar exchange rates. 
Many traders interpret the stance as relating only to the crucial dollar-mark and dollar-yen rates. 
Therefore, "If you want to sell dollars, you may as well buy sterling," Mr. Woodland said. 

   Traders also see some positive developments for the political fortunes of Britain's ruling Conservative Party. 
The government is expected to release a budget this month that likely will result in reduced public-sector borrowings and possibly a tax decrease, traders said. 
Some analysts also are encouraged that the Labor Party, the Conservatives' chief rival, failed to win a special parliamentary election last Thursday. 

   In other trading, the dollar rose to 1.8373 marks, from 1.8258, and to 153.70 yen, from 153.18. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday the dollar was unchanged against the Japanese currency, at 153.70 yen quoted in New York yesterday afternoon. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery fell $1.80 an ounce to $403.60 in light trading estimated at two million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $403.40 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: U.K. Intervenes To Boost Pound After Sharp Fall --- Traders See More Increases In British Interest Rates In Bid to Aid Currency </HL>

   The pound fell yesterday, despite a scramble by the United Kingdom to bolster the currency with higher interest rates and intervention. 

   The dollar was mixed against other major currencies in trading that dealers described as very active, volatile and at times confusing. 

   In hectic early European trading, the pound plunged more than three pfennig to 3.1130 marks from above 3.1450 marks. 
Then around noon, the Bank of England raised one of its key money-market intervention rates, signaling that it intended to defend the currency. 
About an hour later, major British banks, led by Barclays Bank PLC, began raising their so-called base-lending rates -- which serve as a benchmark for commercial lending -- by one-half a percentage point to 8%. 

   Sterling climbed briefly, but then fell as traders used the higher rates to resume selling the currency. 
At one point, it fell as low as 3.1030 marks and $1.7952. 
Eventually, the currency stabilized, but only after the Bank of England intervened by buying pounds and selling dollars. 

   Nonetheless, many traders predicted further rate increases would be needed to support the pound, perhaps as early as today. 
The interest-rate boost reversed three successive rate cuts totaling 1 1/2 percentage points that began in mid-March. 

   "Sterling is very vulnerable at the moment," said Keith R. Baker, foreign-exchange manager in London for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. 
He said there was very heavy selling from speculators in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. 

   Kevin Gardiner, an economist at London stockbroker Warburg Securities, said: "The crack in the pound appeared earlier and quicker than anyone expected. 
This isn't the end of the story." 
For a while, he said, the pound was in "a free fall." 

   In late afternoon New York trading, the pound stood at 3.1041 marks and $1.8047, down from $1.8136 late Wednesday and $1.8559 before the Memorial Day weekend. 
At the beginning of this week, the pound stood as high as 3.19 marks. 
Three weeks ago, it traded as high as $1.8915. 

   Several weeks ago, "sterling looked like a good bet; the expectation was we'd get through the 3.20-mark level," said Martin Kingsick, a vice president at Royal Bank of Canada in London. 
"We didn't." 

   The pound's value against the mark -- and other European currencies that are effectively or actually pegged to it -- is more important to Britain than the pound/dollar rate. 
That's because about 60% of the U.K.'s exports go to Europe as opposed to 10% to the U.S. 

   Traders said the pound came under strong selling pressure from speculators who were unwinding large long-sterling/short-mark positions by selling pounds and buying marks. 
Because the dollar is used as an intermediary in such cross-rate transactions, it rose against its British counterpart but fell against the mark. 

   In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.7201 marks from 1.7310 marks the day before. 
It rose to 126.13 yen from 125.43 yen on Wednesday. 
Most West German banks were closed for a holiday. 

   The dollar opened at 126.07 yen in early Friday trading in Tokyo. 

   Accelerating the pound's plunge, said traders, were so-called stop-loss orders triggered when the pound fell through key points on charts that some traders use to predict currency movements. 
Corporations, institutional investors and other financial institutions often leave orders with banks to buy or sell currencies automatically at specific levels. 

   "There's a drastic unwinding of all speculative positions that flowed in during the (Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher-(Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel) Lawson brouhaha," said Trevor N. Cass, foreign-exchange manager for Barclays Bank. 
"All that hot money is flowing right back out again." 

   In early March, Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Lawson publicly disagreed over the country's yearlong unofficial policy of trying to hold the pound between 2.93 marks and 3.00 marks through intervention. 
As a consequence, sterling was allowed to rise. 

   Currently, Britain's currency is plagued by a growing trade and current-account deficits plus an enormous expansion of consumer credit. 
While London has projected about a #4 billion trade deficit for this year, market estimates run from #6 billion to #8 billion. 

   Traders said sterling was also damaged by recent increases in dollar interest rates. 
In fact, some traders said the West German and Japanese central banks took advantage of the dollar's recent relative strength to sell dollars to reduce their enormous foreign-exchange reserves. 

   Mr. Cass said the market's attitude toward the U.S. currency "was wait and see; it used to be bearish." 

   Jack Kessler, a senior vice president and head of Chase Manhattan Bank's currency operations in New York, predicted, "The dollar will remain firm, at least until we start approaching the release of the (April) trade numbers" on June 12. 

   Even so, some analysts are worried that the deficit could climb back to as high as $12 billion. 
Kenneth de La Salle, foreign exchange manager for National Westminster Bank PLC in London, said: "The dollar will ease back after a few days unless you get (a U.S.) interest-rate hike." 

   He also expects the pound "to stabilize after the panic of the last few days." 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for June delivery settled at $467.00 an ounce, up $9.40. 
Estimated volume was a heavy six million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $466.35 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.

   The dollar firmed in sparse holiday trading on Friday's news that West Germany will impose a 10% withholding tax on most income from investments and bank deposits. 

   Trading was all but nonexistent in New York because of the Columbus Day holiday, which also curtailed volume in European currency markets. 

   The thin market and traders' caution ahead of tomorrow's U.S. report on the August trade balance meant few major dollar positions were created. 
Attention focused instead on trading among other currencies, in which the West German mark generally weakened because of the proposed withholding tax. 

   Traders said such a levy, which Bonn proposes to enact in 1989, would divert investment from West Germany and from mark-denominated assets to Britain, Japan, Switzerland and the U.S. 

   In London, the Bank of England sold a small amount of British pounds in the foreign exchange market to try to hold sterling below 3.00 marks, dealers said. 

   The British central bank entered the market with the pound trading at 2.9990 marks, a dealer said. 
Because of the shallowness of yesterday's market, the intervention easily pushed the pound back down to 2.9968 marks. 
But in the sparse price quotes posted late in the New York trading day, sterling rebounded to 3.001, compared with 2.9948 late Friday in New York. 

   Although the Bank of England, as usual, wouldn't comment on the reported intervention, monetary sources confirmed the activity. 

   The dollar was quoted at 1.8153 marks in late New York trading, compared with 1.8103 late Friday. 
The U.S. currency also firmed to 143.90 Japanese yen from 143.68, while the pound eased to $1.6530 from $1.6543. 

   The U.S. currency was trading at 142.95 yen in early Tokyo activity today. 

   The dollar began yesterday by strengthening in Asian markets, helped by a report that Japan's trade surplus narrowed to $7.43 billion in September from $8.95 billion a year earlier. 
Although the surplus was wider than the $5.15 billion in the previous month, September was the fifth consecutive month in which Japan's trade surplus has narrowed from a year earlier. 

   Many market participants remain pessimistic about tomorrow's U.S. trade report. 

   Paul S. Chertkow, director of currency research at Hoare Govett, a London unit of Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles, said the dollar will fall to 1.79 marks and 141 yen this month if the U.S. trade deficit is $13 billion or wider. 
The July gap was a record $16.47 billion. 

   "A U.S. deficit in the order of $13 billion would still leave the cumulative deficit in the first eight months of the year some 2.5% higher than in the same period of 1986," he said. 

   David Rumsey, a London trader for New York-based Citicorp, said, "People are preparing themselves for bad news." 
He cited a survey of economists last week in which the consensus forecast was for a U.S. trade deficit of $14.3 billion. 

   Mr. Chertkow said the narrowing Japanese surplus shouldn't lead to optimism about the U.S. report. 

   "There is no statistical correlation between the monthly trade data of the U.S. and that of Japan," he said. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 20 cents an ounce to $461.70 in light trading. 
Estimated volume was 1.3 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $461.75 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Pound Keeps Going Up Even as Banks In Britain Cut Base Rates Half a Point </HL>

   Britain seems to be losing the battle to curb its currency. 

   Although British base rates fell half a point to 8% Friday -- their lowest level in a decade -- the pound persevered to close higher against the mark and unchanged against the dollar. 
Foreign exchange markets probably will be quiet early this week, before the Group of Seven finance ministers meet in Washington. 
But after that, economists here expect sterling to resume its rise, pushing toward $1.90 and 3.15-3.20 marks. 

   By today, "We'll all be wondering what (the base-rate cut) has achieved," Graham Turner, an economist at Warburg Securities in London, predicted Friday. 
"And the answer is, not much. 
Cutting base rates will do nothing to divert the current bullish sentiment from sterling." 

   Friday's interest rate cut followed apparently coordinated, and largely unsuccessful, intervention by the Bank of England and the West German central bank earlier last week to buy dollars for pounds. 
Sterling's continued resistance to downward pressure is a blow against Britain's efforts to maintain stable exchange rates. 
And sharp cuts in interest rates renew worries about a further deterioration in Britain's widening current-account deficit. 

   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson surprised markets Friday by directing banks to cut their base rates to 8%. 
The previous day sterling had surged to a two-year high in London of 3.13 marks despite the apparent intervention by central banks. 
When trading opened Friday, the pound continued to rise, quickly edging above 3.14 marks. 

   Later that morning, the Bank of England lowered its money market intervention rate 3/8 point to 8%, prompting Midland Bank PLC to announce its base-rate reduction. 
Other leading British banks soon followed. 
Last month, banks decreased base rates to 8 1/2% from 9%, reversing a half-point rise Feb.1. 

   Government officials said they intended the base-rate cut to counteract somewhat the tightening of monetary policy caused by the rising pound. 
Officials said they also wanted to send a decisive signal to investors that the government would prevent the pound rising "unsustainably." 
But despite the effort, sterling closed Friday at 3.14, up a pfennig from Thursday. 
The pound rose a little against the dollar, to $1.8755 from $1.8720. 

   Sterling remains buoyed by Britain's probable strong economic growth this year, its relatively high interest rates compared with West Germany and Japan, and by investors' skepticism over whether the British government will cut interest rates here further. 
"With the fundamentals still in sterling's favor, it remains the currency to be with," said Peter Fellner, an economist at stockbrokers James Capel &amp; Co. 

   With sterling rising, inflation doesn't seem a likely result of the downward ratchet in interest rates. 
A bigger worry is a further deterioration in Britain's current-account deficit, which stood at #720 million ($1.35 billion) in February compared with a surplus of #430 million a year earlier. 
The current account tallies a nation's trade in goods, services and certain unilateral transfers. 
A further decline in Britain's current-account deficit could occur if higher demand, resulting from lower interest rates, sucks in more imports. 

   ---
   Friday's Currency Activity
   The dollar was little changed as attention turned to Wednesday's expected meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven nations and Thursday's report of the U.S. trade balance for February. 

   Late Friday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6750 West German marks, down from 1.6765 Thursday. 
The dollar was unchanged at 125.70 yen, although in early trading Monday in Tokyo, the dollar was changing hands at 125.75 yen. 

   The pound fell slightly to $1.8745, from $1.8750, and was unchanged at 3.14 marks in New York trading. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 80 cents an ounce to $451.60 in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 2.8 million ounces. 
Gold was quoted at $450.50 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Profit-Taking Ends Sterling's Eight-Day Rise --- Dollar Strengthens Widely But Drops Against Yen; U.K. Budget Due Today </HL>
<AUTHOR> Charles W. Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

   The pound lost ground for the first time in eight trading days yesterday as dealers sold sterling to take profits on its 5% rise since March 3. 

   Traders said sterling's weakness spilled over to other European currencies, allowing the dollar to strengthen across a wide front. 

   The dollar eased against the yen, however. 
Unlike the European currencies, the yen didn't benefit indirectly from the pound's recent strength, and therefore, the Japanese currency wasn't pressured by yesterday's selling of sterling, traders said. 

   The profit-taking on sterling positions yesterday came on the eve of today's release of the U.K. budget for the fiscal year beginning in April, and a budget speech to Parliament by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. 
The budget is expected to show a surplus for the year in addition to as much as #4 billion ($7.43 billion) in tax cuts. 

   "The good news is out," said Richard E. Witten, vice president, foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New York. 
People already know "how optimistic Lawson's budget message will be and there was a lot of profit-taking," he said. 

   The pound was quoted at $1.8515 in late New York trading Monday, down 0.3% from $1.8565 Friday. 

   In other trading, the dollar climbed 0.3% to 1.6650 West German marks, from 1.6600 Friday, and slipped 0.4% to 126.90 yen, from 127.36. 

   In Tokyo, the dollar opened Tuesday at 127.04 yen, down from 127.23 yen Monday in Japan. 

   Trading was subdued by anticipation of the British budget news today and Thursday's release of January U.S. merchandise trade data. 
Market participants generally expect the trade report to show that the U.S. trade deficit widened to between $13 billion and $14 billion, from $12.2 billion in December. 
Expectations for a deeper trade deficit will keep downward pressure on the dollar for the rest of the week, traders said. 

   In the event of a better-than-expected trade report, many dealers believe the dollar's upside potential is limited. 
Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.'s New York agency, said any dollar recovery will trigger existing sell orders, by Japanese exporters in particular, which would cool any dollar rally. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 60 cents an ounce to $441.90 in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 2.5 million ounces.

To Keep Focusing
On British Pound

   The British pound is likely to remain the focus of attention on the foreign-exchange market this week as the U.S. dollar continues to play a reduced role in trading, dealers predict. 

   The dollar rose against most other major currencies Friday, aided by U.S. emloyment statistics that were slightly better than expected. 
Nonetheless, the currency continued to trade within a narrow range. 

   As for sterling, some traders believe that the British currency is close to topping out for the near term following last week's rally. 
But many say that relatively high British interest rates and continued stability in the value of other major currencies against one another will keep attention on the pound. 

   "We're still going to see some demand for sterling. 
That's been the big game lately," says J. Steven Stekly, a Bank of Boston trader. 

   In late New York trading Friday, the pound stood at $1.5853, up from $1.5838 the day before and 2.4% above its level of a week earlier. 
Sterling's gains against its European counterparts were even sharper. 
Against the West German currency, for instance, the pound climbed 0.7% Friday, to 2.9254 marks from 2.9047 Thursday. 
On the week, the pound gained 3.5% against the mark. 

   The pound is being aided by British interest rates, which are higher than those in other major countries; expectations that a British tax cut will be proposed next week; and what is perceived to be increased stability for the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 

   In the dollar's case, meanwhile, concern that central banks might intervene in support of the currency has discouraged aggressive selling despite bearish U.S. economic indicators in recent weeks. 
One exception to the bearish statistics was Friday's employment report for February, which showed the U.S. jobless rate unchanged at 6.7% and a robust increase of 337,000 in nonfarm payroll employment. 

   The intervention expectations stem from an accord aimed at stabilizing exchange rates announced Feb. 22 by the six biggest industrial nations. 
Finance ministers from the countries -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada -- were meeting in Paris. 

   "By no means are we out of the range that we've been in in the past two weeks" for the dollar, says Joseph F. Teel, a trader at Fidelity Bank, Philadelphia. 

   The dollar climbed to 1.8453 marks Friday from 1.8340 Thursday, and to 153.70 Japanese yen from 153.33. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery fell $1 an ounce, to $406.20, in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 2.2 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $407.90 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.

   The dollar firmed in quiet trading yesterday as dealers awaited the release of U.S. economic indicators and reflected on swings earlier in the week. 

   "After Monday and Tuesday, we needed a day of rest," said Robert Hatcher, vice president and corporate foreign-exchange dealer at Barclays Bank International Ltd., New York. 
The dollar plunged Monday and then partially recovered Tuesday. 

   The reports on the economy "should give us the next direction for the dollar," said Albert Soria, vice president and foreign-exchange manager at Swiss Bank Corp., New York. 

   Traders said exchange rates already reflect a drop in January retail sales of between 4% and 5%. 
The Commerce Department is due to release the actual figure this morning. 

   Tomorrow, the producer price index is expected to show an increase of about 0.4% for January, while industrial production is forecast to show a 0.3% rise. 

   In late New York trading yesterday, the U.S. unit stood at 1.8195 West German marks, up slightly from 1.8153 a day earlier. 
The dollar also climbed to 153.94 Japanese yen from 153.43. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 154 from 153.94 in New York yesterday afternoon. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for current delivery fell 60 cents, to $402.40 an ounce, in moderate trading. 
The estimated volume was 3.2 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $402 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.

Dollar and the Pound Will Be Watched

   Currency traders are debating whether the British pound's declines Thursday and Friday signal an end to investors' recent hearty appetite for high-yielding currencies. 

   They also wonder whether the dollar's fall against the yen and West German mark Friday indicates a new willingness to push the U.S. unit lower and test central bankers' determination to support it. 

   "It's a confused market," Anne Parker Mills, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said. 

   She and other analysts this week will be trying to determine the impact of several events: the announcement of the new British government budget tomorrow, the approach of the March 31 end of Japan's fiscal year, central banks' unexpected willingness so far to intervene to keep their currencies from rising too far against the dollar and growing worries about Third World debt. 

   In late Friday trading in New York, the dollar stood at 1.8520 West German marks and 152.41 Japanese yen, a decline from 1.8590 marks and 153.38 yen Thursday. 
The British pound fell to $1.5760 from $1.5875 the day before. 

   Traders attributed the pound's decline to profit-taking as well as to talk of another possible cut in British interest rates and traders' unwinding of long, or overbought, pound positions in advance of the budget message. 
Dealers also remained wary of trying to push the currency higher after some suspected intervention by the Bank of England last week to stem its rise. 

   Sterling's biggest fall came against the mark. 
The pound dropped 2.1% from about 2.98 marks to 2.9187 in little more than 24 hours. 
That move also caused the dollar to ease against the mark, traders said. 

   Traders questioned whether the pound's fall after reaching $1.60 last week signals the end of the "stretch for yield" of the past three weeks. 
Since Feb. 22, when the six largest non-communist industrialized nations agreed at a meeting in Paris that the dollar had fallen far enough, the U.S. currency has traded in a fairly narrow range against the mark and yen. 

   That has sent investors and speculators into higher-yielding currencies, especially those of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 
While rates paid on three-month Eurodeposits of dollars, marks and yen recently stood at 6.38%, 3.94% and 4.19%, respectively, the comparable rates on the British, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand currencies were 9.88%, 6.89%, 16.4% and 25.7%. 

   Analysts noted that last week, while the pound climbed to a four-year high against the dollar, Canada's currency reached a more than two-year high, the Australian dollar was at a four-month peak, and the New Zealand dollar was at its highest in nearly a year against the U.S. currency. 

   But by Friday, each of those currencies had retreated from its week's high. 
In addition to the possible British central bank action, Australia's Reserve Bank was rumored to have sold large quantities of Australian dollars late Thursday in Far Eastern markets, lowering the currency to less than 67 1/2 U.S. cents from about 69 cents. 
Nicholas P. Sargen, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc., said Canadian government data also "reflect Bank of Canada activity to hold down the advance of the Canadian dollar." 

   "The play of high-yield currencies may be temporarily over," Albert Soria, foreign exchange manager for Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said. 
Mr. Sargen, however, remains unconvinced. 

   "As long as there is a conviction that the dollar will be essentially stable, people are going to reach for yield," he said. 
Ms. Mills of Shearson Lehman said "the focus could return to the pound" if Britain's budget calls for reduced government borrowing and tax cuts. 

   Since the Feb. 22 meeting, fear and rumors of central bank intervention have kept the dollar between 1.82 and 1.87 marks and between 152 and 154 yen. 
With the market having failed to drive the U.S. currency higher last week, Mr. Soria and others say, it could try to nudge the dollar lower this week. 

   "As long as the dollar remains below 152.80 yen (an important point on charts that traders use to try to predict currency movements), we have the potential to go to 150," he said. 
Mr. Soria also said the exchange rate between the yen and the mark rate hasn't changed since September 1985, when the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain agreed to a coordinated program to bring down the dollar's value. 

   "The market perceives this as meaning that the yen should rise against the mark and other Continental currencies," he said. 
Mr. Soria said he expects the dollar to remain in a range of 145 to 155 yen and 1.77 to 1.87 marks in the near term. 

   Michael A. Gotthelf, a vice president at Berliner Handels &amp; Frankfurter Bank in New York, said growing apprehension about the effect of the Latin American debt crisis on U.S. banks could hurt the dollar. 
He noted Friday's warning by Antonio Ortiz Mena, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, that if commercial banks don't make additional loans to Latin American debtors, "the consequence in the long run is that there are going to be defaults." 

   Traders also pointed to an announcement by Citicorp that it may be forced to place $3.9 billion of Brazilian loans on a nonaccrual basis, a step that could reduce earnings. 

   Nonetheless, Japanese dealers said trading related to the ending of Japan's fiscal year could help support the U.S. currency. 
Masakazu Miyamori, chief trader for Sanwa Bank in New York, predicted that Japan's life insurance companies will be big purchasers of dollar investments in the next 2 1/2 weeks. 

   He also said the Ministry of Finance requires Japanese corporations and life insurers to write off exchange losses on their dollar assets at the end of the fiscal year if the yen has risen more than 15% against the dollar during the year. 
The crucial point in that calculation, he said, is 153.65 yen. 

   Because of these as well as political pressures in Japan to reduce corporate losses, other traders said they expect any rises in the yen to be constrained by the Bank of Japan, at least until April. 

   "I definitely think the market will ultimately test the central banks, but it will need more momentum" than it has exhibited in recent weeks, Felix Fischer, a first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, said. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery this month settled Friday at $403.90 an ounce, down $4.80. 
Estimated volume was a hefty 4.5 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $404.80 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.

   The dollar dropped back in foreign exchange trading in response to intervention by the West German central bank. 

   Despite the Bundesbank's dollar sales, traders said, simmering tensions in the Middle East probably will keep the upward pressure on the U.S. currency. 

   A Bundesbank spokesman in Frankfurt confirmed that the central bank sold dollars yesterday after the U.S. currency came off an intraday high of 1.8890 West German marks. 
That represents a high-water mark for the dollar in its current rally sparked by fears of a widening Persian Gulf conflict. 

   The dollar climbed to 6 1/2-month highs early this week as investors sought the currency after Iran threatened to expand its war against Iraq to include other Mideast nations and the U.S. 
The Iranian threat followed the deaths of rioting Iranian pilgrims in Saudi Arabia Friday. 

   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8804 marks, compared with 1.8885 late Tuesday. 
It also fell to 150.82 Japanese yen from 151.68, and the British pound climbed to $1.5797 from $1.5735. 

   In early Tokyo trading today, the dollar was quoted at 150.70 yen. 

   Market participants generally viewed yesterday's Bundesbank intervention in the context of February's Paris agreement between the U.S. and its major allies to keep exchange rates stable. 
Periodic intervention since that agreement has led many traders to believe that the major central banks aim to keep the dollar roughly between 1.80 and 1.90 marks. 

   Other market speculation holds that the central banks only want to dull any sharp spikes in exchange-rate movements. 

   "At the moment, they're putting a cap on the dollar at 1.8850 (marks)," Yani M.A. Budiman, vice president, corporate foreign exchange, at Chemical Bank, New York, said. 
However, he said, the dollar will remain supported "as long as tensions in the Mideast continue." 

   Martin Rieben, vice president, foreign exchange, for Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said "the dollar will slowly go up" even if central bank intervention against the currency is resumed. 

   "It's the Middle East, it's the uncertainty. 
We don't know what's cooking, but we smell it everywhere," Mr. Rieben said. 
"I feel secure if I have a few dollars in my pocket." 

   The chief trader at one bank with close central bank ties speculated that West Germany may have had its own reasons for intervening. 
The Bundesbank, along with the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, bought large amounts of dollars this spring to halt a steep dive in the U.S. currency's value. 
In selling dollars yesterday, the trader said, the Bundesbank could have registered a sizable foreign exchange profit. 

   "I think they'd be thrilled if the dollar went higher," he said. 

   In addition, he said, any Bundesbank move to sell dollars and buy marks would help West Germany's efforts to control its rapidly expanding money supply. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $10.80 an ounce to $466.80 in brisk trading. 
Estimated volume was 5.8 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $467.85 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.

Japan's Central Bank Chief
Says U.S. Has Moved
To Support Currency

   A remark by Japan's central bank chief that the U.S. Federal Reserve has acted to avert a further drop in the dollar pushed the currency to the top of its recent trading range against the Japanese yen. 

   Separately, officials in London said the Bank of England's underlying reserves fell $230 million in June. 
The drop, which private analysts hadn't been expecting, apparently reflected intervention by the British central bank to support the pound after the Conservative Party government's election victory June 11. 

   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar's gains yesterday resulted in part from comments by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that he believes the U.S. Federal Reserve has been actively trying to prevent a further dollar decline and that the Bank of Japan will stay in close touch with other central banks to secure exchange-rate stability. 
Mr. Sumita didn't elaborate on his remarks about the Fed's actions. 

   In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood at 147.50 yen, up 0.5% from 146.80 late Wednesday. 
Volume remained light ahead of the Fourth of July holiday weekend. 

   In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 147.52 yen. 

   "There was nothing much to point to other than Mr. Sumita's comments," Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said. 
"That's what kept the dollar firming." 

   Mr. Sumita also told a Tokyo luncheon gathering that recent exchange-rate movements indicate that confidence in the dollar's strength has been recovering "to a certain extent." 
He said a further decline in the currency would work against continued economic expansion in Japan, Europe and the U.S. 

   The central banker also said Japanese investment in U.S. securities has been showing renewed growth and said expectations of a further fall by the dollar are receding. 

   In other trading yesterday, the dollar firmed against most other major currencies. 
It advanced 0.3% to 1.8329 West German marks from 1.8278, and the British pound eased marginally to $1.6169 from $1.6170. 

   The drop in British reserves appeared to have little impact on the market. 
Government officials said the Bank of England's actions last month to support the pound didn't represent any policy change. 
They said the British central bank intervened to smooth sterling's decline when an expected heavy flow of foreign funds into Britain failed to materialize after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's election victory. 

   The decline in the underlying reserves contrasted with several private analysts' expectations of about a $500 million gain in June. 
It also followed three months of increases totaling nearly $9.5 billion in the country's underlying gold and foreign-currency reserves. 
Figures on underlying reserves exclude any foreign-currency activities by public entities such as local governments or nationalized industries. 

   Although Britain's Treasury says changes in underlying reserves shouldn't be viewed as indicating central bank intervention, analysts still regard the figures as a general guide to the scale of Bank of England activity in the currency markets. 
The nation's Treasury also said yesterday that unadjusted reserves fell $315 million last month to $34.4 billion. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 60 cents an ounce to $446.30 in moderate trading. 
Estimated volume was 3.2 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $446.95 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.

   Public opinion polls in Britain that showed the ruling Conservative Party widening its lead over its rivals caused the British pound to rally in otherwise dull foreign-exchange trading yesterday. 

   The dollar was narrowly mixed in thin trading, and traders said the market could be quiet for the rest of the week while finance ministers from major industrial nations meet in Washington. 
They cautioned that the calm could be disturbed at any time, however, by leaks or disclosures about the talks. 

   The Bank of England was rumored to have stepped in to limit the pound's advance yesterday by selling sterling and buying dollars and West German marks. 
In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.6183, up 0.4% from $1.6120 Friday. 
Sterling also rose against the West German currency to 2.9547 marks from 2.9416. 
In intraday trading, the pound reached as high as $1.6240 and 2.96 marks, traders said. 

   In addition to the British opinion polls published in several major newspapers Sunday and yesterday, traders said, Britain's relatively high interest rates continue to help buoy the pound. 

   Most of the foreign-exchange market, meanwhile, is clinging to a bearish view on the dollar as officials from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain prepare for talks tomorrow. 
The U.S. currency's recent fall against most other major currencies presumably will figure prominently in the discussions, which may also include finance officials from Canada and Italy. 

   "When I look at the (U.S.) trade deficit, there's no doubt in my mind that the dollar has to go lower," Frank Pusateri, assistant vice president and senior corporate trader at Bank of Boston, said. 
He said he would be "very surprised" if any major new development comes from the five-nation meeting. 
Next week, he said he expects the dollar to move down to the ranges of 1.77 to 1.80 West German marks and 140 to 145 Japanese yen. 

   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8258 marks, a slight advance from 1.8248 late Friday, and at 145.93 yen, compared with 146.10 Friday. 

   The dollar was quoted at 145.90 yen in early Tokyo trading Tuesday. 

   When finance ministers from the major industrial nations met in Paris Feb. 22, they agreed to coordinate measures to stabilize exchange rates. 
Since then, the dollar has fallen 5% against the yen, even though the five countries' central banks have bought an estimated $10 billion of the U.S. currency to try to support its value. 
In the same period, by contrast, the dollar has risen 0.4% against the West German mark. 

   The Bank of Japan intervened in the Tokyo market again yesterday, selling yen to buy dollars. 
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a legislative panel in Tokyo that the Washington talks will probably produce a reaffirmation of the currency-stability accord. 
Traders, meanwhile, said anything short of a reaffirmation would be extremely bearish for the dollar. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery declined $1.20 an ounce to $418.50 in moderate trading estimated at 3.3 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $419.85 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.

   The dollar continued climbing in foreign exchange trading yesterday as dealers weighed the significance of the U.S. Federal Reserve's intervention to support the dollar last week. 

   Neither the Fed nor other major central banks were seen intervening in currency markets yesterday, traders said. 
But last week's apparently coordinated dollar purchases by the Fed, the West German Bundesbank, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England left many dealers with the impression that the major monetary powers were embarking on another period of close cooperation to support the U.S. currency. 

   "The spirit of the Louvre may be coming back again," said Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign exchange manager at European American Bank, New York. 
Mr. Ryan was referring to the currency rate stabilization agreement signed in Paris last February. 

   An article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal reporting a shift in U.S. policy toward more emphasis on supporting the dollar also contributed to the currency's strength, traders said. 

   The dollar continued to strengthen more against major European currencies than against the Japanese yen. 
Following last week's interest rate cuts in Europe, which made dollar-denominated investments relatively more attractive, Japanese interest rates were left unchanged, maintaining the yield differentials between the U.S. and Japan. 

   In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at close to its highs of the day. 
The dollar climbed 0.5% to 1.6783 West German marks, from 1.6695 Friday, while the British pound eased to $1.7863, from $1.7920. 
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar moved slightly higher to 132.97 yen, from 132.50. 
In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar opened at 133.05 yen, but soon fell below the 133 yen level on heavy selling by a Japanese trust bank and conflicting rumors about Thursday's U.S. October trade deficit release. 

   Explaining the recent buying interest in dollars, dealers said the Reagan administration has launched a new drive to support the U.S. currency in response to the European interest rate cuts last week. 
The administration had been pressing for lower interest rates and more stimulative economic policies abroad, especially from West Germany. 
Faster growth overseas could spur demand for American products and help narrow the huge U.S. trade deficit, the administration reasoned. 

   Traders believe West Germany is now getting the cooperation from the U.S. that it sought in countering the dollar's decline, which makes West German exports costly for Americans and puts stress on the European Monetary System, an eight-currency exchange rate mechanism centered around the mark. 

   "The U.S., as a show of good faith, has gone out to support the dollar, to say 'thank you'" to the West Germans, said Mr. Ryan at European American Bank. 
"The dollar's looking like it has a new lease on life," he added. 

   The dollar could get another lift today if speculation yesterday about another lowering of a key interest rate in West Germany proves correct. 
The West German central bank, which cut its discount rate last week, may decide to cut more money market rates, making yields on dollar investments more attractive. 
The Bundesbank is expected to call for tenders on securities repurchase agreements today. 
The last set of repos were executed at 3.25% before the discount rate cut. 

   Although sentiment has shifted in favor of the dollar, traders said they remain bearish toward the U.S. currency. 
Many dealers are watching out for a sell-off of dollars either ahead of or immediately after Thursday's Commerce Department report on the October merchandise trade balance. 
The U.S. trade deficit remains a big factor in long-term negative outlook for the dollar. 
"Come Wednesday morning, you'll probably see interest in taking profits on long (or overbought) dollar positions. 
Old fears of the trade numbers will return," said Leslie A. Puth, a corporate trader at Banque Indosuez in New York. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.40 an ounce to $481.50 in light trading. 
The estimated volume was 1.3 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $481.75 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Currency Markets: Dollar Declines After Traders Rush to Marks --- Speculation Is Bundesbank Will Raise Interest Rates After a Meeting Today </HL>

   A rush to marks ahead of the Bundesbank's central bank council meeting today strengthened the West German currency by three pfennigs against the dollar yesterday. 

   The surge left foreign-exchange traders wondering if the mark's recent decline has come to an end. 

   The mark was boosted by the West German central bank's announcement that a news conference would be held after today's council meeting. 
The announcement invited speculation that the monetary authority would move to raise interest rates then. 
Many economists expect the Bundesbank to boost rates because a series of concerted dollar sales by central banks had limited success in swaying bullish sentiments for the U.S. currency in foreign-exchange markets. 

   In a reversal of recent trading patterns, dealers became increasingly anxious to unload dollars as a succession of events yesterday shifted interest to the mark. 

   The drive started early on when Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita, who has been reticent about criticizing prevailing market-exchange rates, said the mark's decline was "inexplicable and almost unacceptable," and voiced his support for a stable dollar-mark rate. 
His remarks forced the dollar to retreat to 1.9020 marks after trading around 1.9080 marks. 

   Soon afterward, the Bundesbank, along with the Belgian and Swiss central banks, entered the European market to sell dollars for their respective currencies. 
The coordinated action sent the dollar below 1.9000 marks, but it bounced back. 

   The Bundesbank sold dollars again as New York trading commenced, and the U.S. unit again dipped below 1.9000 marks. 
Each intervention was confirmed by the central banks. 

   In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8817 marks, down from 1.9120 marks Tuesday, and at 133.86 yen, down from 134.13 yen. 
In Tokyo on Thursday, the U.S. currency opened at 133.93 yen. 
In New York on Wednesday, the pound rose to $1.6865, from $1.6745 Tuesday. 

   U.S. short-term market interest rates on average are more than three percentage points higher than West German rates, making the higher-yielding dollar more attractive to foreign investors. 
Boosting West German rates would narrow the gap and help take pressure off of the mark, economists say. 

   The bulk of the dollar's decline yesterday reflected renewed mark strength as opposed to heightened dollar pessimism, dealers said. 
"Most of the action. . .was in mark-sterling, followed closely by mark-yen," said Peter Van der Mespel, corporate foreign-exchange chief at Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, New York. 

   "The latest West German trade figures showed just how undervalued the mark is right now," he said. 
"The Bundesbank surely is growing weary of spending so many dollars propping up its currency, and the trade figures might provide them with the perfect excuse to raise interest rates instead." 

   Preliminary figures, confirmed yesterday, showed West Germany's trade surplus surged 38% in June to a record 14.2 billion marks ($7.44 billion) from 10.3 billion marks in May. 

   Dealers also said a late mark rally was triggered by a large stop-loss order from a London clearing-house bank to sell sterling for marks when the pound fell to 3.1775 marks. 
One New York dealer estimated the order totaled between #250 million ($418.8 million) and #500 million, "more than enough to move the market." 

   The pound, which dropped to an intraday low of around 3.1500 marks before recovering to trade near 3.1740 marks, is under pressure as the foreign-exchange market braces itself for today's announcement of poor U.K. trade data. 

   Economists expect a British trade deficit of #1.3 billion to #1.7 billion, widened from June's #1 billion shortfall. 
Some dealers say the U.K. trade data to some extent may determine what, if any, interest-rate action the Bundesbank takes at its meeting today. 

   "With so much trading focused on pound-mark cross trading, the U.K. trade figures will be crucial," said mark trader Jerry Eagan at the Bank of Boston. 
"The Bank of England might even choose to raise its own interest rates if the trade figures cause the pound to fall dramatically, and that would present an entirely new set of circumstances to the Bundesbank officials." 

   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $434.90 an ounce, up $2.70. 
Estimated volume was a light to moderate 2.6 million ounces. 

   In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was quoted at $434.25 an ounce.

   For the third consecutive day, some major central banks fought off a bullish charge by the dollar, substantially limiting the U.S. currency's gains. 

   The intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the West German Bundesbank seemed to represent a stepped-up effort to contain the dollar in its surge prompted by fears of a widened Persian Gulf war. 
Yesterday's action appeared more coordinated than the earlier efforts. 

   As before, all central bank dollar sales were against the West German mark. 
However, in late New York trading the U.S. currency still held part of its advance for the day, standing at 1.8836 marks, compared with 1.8804 late Wednesday. 

   "The (intervention) had a very short-term effect in the market," a trader at a commercial bank that deals with the Fed said. 
Commercial bank traders with firsthand knowledge of the intervention estimated that the Fed sold $100 million through several banks in early New York trading, shortly after the Bundesbank sold a like amount in the open market in Frankfurt. 

   The central banks formed a skirmish line for the dollar at 1.8840 marks, where they sold the currency, knowledgeable traders said. 
Before its open-market intervention, the Bundesbank sold $5.7 million at yesterday's Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing as the U.S. currency rose to 1.8842 marks, a seven-month high. 

   Traders say the intervention level stems from February's Louvre accord in Paris. 
At that time, the U.S. and its major allies agreed to maintain exchange-rate stability, though they have never formally acknowledged setting specific target zones for rates. 

   There also was speculation that the Bank of England sold $100 million for marks in London trading. 

   But although the amounts represented an increase from the level of intervention reported early this week, the activity was still modest compared with the central banks' coordinated effort to support the dollar this spring. 
For this reason, some traders say the central banks now seek only to check the dollar's advance, not to reverse it. 

   "If the central banks really wanted to turn the market around, to get us back to 1.80 (marks), they'd come in with heavy dollars," Valerie J. Walker, vice president, foreign exchange, at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, New York, said. 
"They just don't want the dollar to go breakneck to 1.90 without there being some fundamental justification." 

   In other trading, the British pound eased to $1.5773 from $1.5797 despite an increase of a full percentage point, to 10%, in the base lending rate of some major British banks. 
The move followed the Bank of England's action in raising its money market intervention rate a full point to 9 7/8%. 

   Higher British interest rates should make sterling-denominated investments more attractive and increase demand for the pound. 
But traders interpreted yesterday's rate increase as a government-inspired move to control inflation, and inflationary fears have put sterling under pressure in recent weeks. 

   "Raising the rates scared people as to the actual state of the economy," Anthony J. Murphy, a sterling trader for Royal Bank of Canada in New York, said. 

   The dollar was slightly higher on the day against most other major currencies as well, rising to 151.45 Japanese yen in late New York trading from 150.82 a day earlier. 

   In early trading in Tokyo today, the dollar was quoted at 151.20 yen. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.20 an ounce to $468 in moderate trading. 
Estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $468.45 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.

   A mild rally in the dollar Friday ended two weeks of lethargic trading and stirred speculation that the U.S. currency will strengthen in the short run. 

   The speculation is largely based on charts of recent trading activity and observations that despite widespread bearish sentiment, selling pressure hasn't been enough to push the dollar sharply lower. 

   "The momentum, or lack of it, has been a little frustrating on the downside," said Teri Reid, a corporate foreign exchange adviser at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, Chicago. 
"There's more of a likelihood to test the upside," she said. 

   A spate of positive economic news combined with technical factors to push the dollar higher against continental European currencies and the yen Friday. 

   The pound, meanwhile, climbed on news that the British trade deficit for March was much narrower than expected. 
Sterling later surrendered most of its gains. 
Dealers reported that the Bank of England intervened to smooth the pound's rise as it hit an intraday high of $1.8850. 

   In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6775 West German marks, up from 1.6698 Thursday. 
The dollar also climbed to 125.18 yen, from 124.52. 
The pound rose to $1.8765, from $1.8729. 

   In midmorning trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at 125.28 yen. 

   The dollar benefited from a series of economic reports Friday and firming interest rates, dealers said. 
Traders also bought dollars to square short, or oversold, positions in the U.S. currency before an expected liquidity drain in the markets this week caused by holidays in Europe and Japan. 

   It was reported Friday that the U.S. index of leading economic indicators for March rose 0.8%, a little more than expected, while the February index was revised to a 1.3% increase from the previously reported 0.9% rise. 
Also, U.S. new single-family home sales were reported to have risen 4% in March. 
And a small U.S. bank, Riggs National Bank, raised its prime lending rate to 8 3/4% from 8 1/2%. 

   The mildly stronger dollar set off talk among dealers that a rising U.S. currency may reach significant chart points next week, but none said he expects to see a break beyond 127 yen. 

   Victor Von Klemperer, manager of foreign exchange at BankAmerica International, said some significant stop-loss buying could be triggered if the dollar continues its upward drift. 
"If we break through some stops, not too far from where we are now, we could be heading for new highs" compared with levels of the past two weeks, he said. 

   Against the backdrop of the dollar's stagnant behavior recently, Ms. Reid at Harris Trust said Friday's trading could have shown some short-term buying momentum. 
"There seemed to have been a little more interest and activity when the dollar was trading up" Friday, she said. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 40 cents an ounce to $451 in light trading. 
The estimated volume was 1.8 million ounces. 

   In Hong Kong, gold was quoted at $450.70 an ounce in early trading.

   A rumor of central bank selling of dollars snapped the foreign exchange market out of a summer lull, stifling a modest rally in the U.S. currency and leaving the dollar a little lower for the day. 

   The British pound also took a beating in the market, prompting the Bank of England to come to its rescue by buying sterling in the open market, traders said. 

   Although activity was sudden and hectic, the swing in exchange rates wasn't large by current market standards. 
Still, the moves caught many dealers by surprise in a market that had been marked by several days of slow summer trading. 

   The dollar moved to an intraday high of 1.8625 West German marks in morning New York trading after the Commerce Department said U.S. leading economic indicators rose a better-than-expected 0.8% last month. 

   But just as traders began loading up on dollars in response to the report, rumors raced through the market that the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank had sold dollars to cut off the currency's rise. 

   Simultaneously, rumors surfaced that the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, either sold dollars or had placed orders to sell the dollar if it rose to 1.8650 marks. 
Although none of the speculation was confirmed, the rumors themselves prevented the dollar from reaching that level. 

   Little more than an hour after reaching its intraday high, the dollar had fallen 0.5% to its low for the day of 1.8535 marks. 

   "There was a very choppy, panicky selling," Betsy Hoy, a corporate trader at Chemical Bank, New York, said. 
"It was a scary market. 
The market was glutted with dollars right away." 

   Although the dollar sell-off originated in trading against the mark, the currency ended up falling farther against the Japanese yen. 
In late New York trading, it stood at 149.51 yen, down 0.8% from 150.75 late Wednesday. 
Against the mark, by contrast, it eventually firmed to stand at 1.8550 marks, only 0.2% lower than 1.8580 a day earlier. 

   The dollar was quoted at 149.60 yen in early Tokyo trading today. 

   Meanwhile, the pound came under pressure from heavy corporate selling in London, traders said, prompting Britain's central bank to buy the currency. 
After reaching an intraday low of $1.5888, the pound climbed back to stand at $1.5930, still down from $1.5995 a day earlier. 

   The pound fell farther against the West German currency, to 2.9550 marks from 2.9719. 

   The rumors of central bank intervention revived speculation among currency traders that the major industrial nations are maintaining a secret target zone for exchange rates. 
The speculation first surfaced this spring when central banks of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain bought billions of dollars in the market to halt a major decline by the currency. 
Later, when a recovery took the dollar to around 1.87 marks, traders said central banks sold the U.S. currency to halt its rise. 

   "The rumors of the central bank intervention really put a lid on the dollar. 
We may indeed be in a target zone," Albert Soria, vice president and foreign exchange manager for Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said. 
"I think we'll continue trading in a very tight range," he said. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $4.80 an ounce to $462.20 in heavy trading. 
Estimated volume was seven million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $462.30 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.

   The dollar was little changed in apprehensive trading as finance ministers from the major industrial nations prepared for meetings in Washington today. 

   Comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker on Capitol Hill inspired some dollar buying. 
But the currency's gains were limited by traders' long-term bearishness and the uncertainty over the Washington meetings. 

   The finance ministers are in Washington for the semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
Top finance officials from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France are expected to meet today for talks on currency rates, and they may be joined by their Canadian and Italian counterparts. 

   Many dealers predicted that no significant result will emerge from the meetings and that the dollar will resume its long decline next week. 

   "We're just biding time, waiting for something to break," Paul O. Steinborn, a foreign-exchange adviser at BankAmerica International, said. 
U.S. and other officials have indicated that the talks will produce a reaffirmation of the Feb. 22 Paris accord, in which major industrial nations agreed to promote exchange-rate stability. 

   The absence of a significant agreement at this week's meetings would be a negative development for the dollar, Mr. Steinborn said. 
Other traders said that to avoid a resumed dollar sell-off next week, the finance ministers must at least reaffirm their February agreement. 

   What little action there was in the foreign-exchange market yesterday followed Mr. Volcker's remarks to a Senate Banking Committee panel. 
The Fed chairman warned of "clear dangers" in relying too much on exchange-rate changes to shrink the huge U.S. trade deficit, and he cited a possible resurgence in inflation. 
Mr. Volcker also said exchange-rate volatility could erode confidence in the stability of financial markets and could worsen Third World debt problems. 

   "He took the dollar a little bit higher, as he usually does," Samuel F. Lek, a trader at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said of Mr. Volcker's comments. 
"Nobody is going to sell dollars right while he's talking." 

   In late New York trading yesterday, the U.S. currency stood at 1.8275 West German marks, a slight advance from 1.8258 Monday. 
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar slipped to 145.60 yen from 145.93. 
The British pound was marginally lower at $1.6180, compared with $1.6183. 

   In early Tokyo trading Wednesday, the dollar fell to 145.33 yen. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery climbed $3.70 an ounce to $422.20 in moderate trading estimated at 2.8 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $423 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.
