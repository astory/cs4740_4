<LEADPARA>  A third of divorced fathers over the age of 50 lose all contact with at least
one of their adult children, according to new research presented Sunday at the
convention of the American Psychological Association.;   Children also blame
fathers more than mothers when marriages end, and many fathers say their
ex-wives block their efforts to have a good relationship with the children,
said the authors of two other studies presented at the convention.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Psychologist Charles Hoffman of California State University, San
Bernardino, said the findings indicate there should be an "affirmative action
program for divorced fathers," who currently lose custody of their children in
90 percent of failed marriages.;   "Sex roles won't change until (divorced)
mothers and fathers parent equally," he said.;   Only half had weekly contact;
  The study of older divorced fathers, conducted by sociologist Peter
Uhlenberg at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, found that only
half of the 261 subjects had weekly contact with their adult children,
compared to 90 percent of married men.;   But a third of the divorced men had
lost all contact with at least one of their children.;   "Adult children are
the principal source of care-giving to older people," he said. "(Older
divorced fathers) are not only lacking a spouse, they're also lacking children
who will come in and provide support." Uhlenberg cited data from his study
showing that only 20 percent of divorced men turn to their children in an
emergency, compared to 50 percent of married men.;   The study was of divorced
men over 50 who had at least one biological child over the age of 19. It did
not indicate at what age the men were divorced.;   Children side with mothers;
  In another study, psychologist Kathleen Welch of Northridge in Southern
California discovered that children usually side with their mothers after
divorces and blame their fathers for the marital rift. That blame only gets
worse as the children age, she said.;   "Divorce loosens the bonds to
fathers," said Welch.;   Together, the new research suggests that fathers
suffer more long-term problems after divorce than was previously thought.;  
Earlier divorce research focused on such topics as the economic problems
suffered by women and children after divorce.;   Wives blamed;   Hoffman's
research on 142 divorced fathers between the ages of 22 and 67 showed that
half said their ex-wives sabotage their efforts to maintain a good
relationship with their children.;   "They often say they want to be involved,
and they say their ex-wives keep them from that involvement," said Hoffman,
who cited earlier data showing that two-thirds of divorces nationwide are
initiated by women.;   Hoffman called on the courts to order joint custody of
children far more often. "Mothers and fathers are equally capable to raise
their children," he said.;   Adult children of divorce -- both men and women
-- have more psychological problems, including anxiety, isolation and fears of
commitment, than children from intact marriages. But the father's active
involvement is especially critical for boys, who suffer more psychological
problems than girls when parents split up, said Hoffman.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  One of the most troubling facts for social scientists and policy-makers alike
has been the high number of girls in their early teens who become mothers,
especially in America's inner cities.;    Now a novel theory proposes that
these young mothers are responding to a pattern in human evolution that
induces people growing up in extremely stressful circumstances to bear
children early and often. The theory has received considerable attention and
criticism.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SURVIVAL OF THE SUFFERING
THEORY LINKS TEEN PREGNANCY TO EVOLUTIONARY
IMPULSES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Drawing on sociobiology, it holds that these teen-age mothers are
implementing a reproductive strategy that, from an evolutionary viewpoint, is
a smart bet.;    Children who grow up in dangerous conditions, the theory
holds, are primed to boost the chances of having their genes survive into the
next generation by choosing earlier sex, earlier motherhood and more
children.;    "It's not a conscious, deliberate strategy. It's a biological
response. From an evolutionary perspective, life is about dispersing your
genes into the next generation," said Dr. Jay Belsky, a psychologist at
Pennsylvania State University and the leading formulator of the new theory.;  
 Earlier puberty;  One prediction of the theory is that girls who grow up in
households where there is great emotional stress, and especially where the
father is absent, will undergo puberty at an earlier age than other girls.;   
The main factors in determining the age of menarche, which is when a girl
begins to menstruate, are genetics, health and nutrition. While these factors
can account for differences of years in the age of menarche, childhood
experiences such as fights between divorcing parents might account for just a
few months' difference, in Belsky's view.;    "It's a small effect
biologically, but quite meaningful, since the timing of menarche is so highly
biologically fixed that no one had thought there was room for psychological
influences at all," said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, a psychologist at Temple
University and a colleague of Belsky's.;    Though highly controversial, the
theory is receiving wide attention among psychologists and sociologists. Next
month it will be the lead article in the prestigious journal Child
Development.;    The theory already is under attack from other scientists. In
a commentary on the article in the same issue of Child Development, Dr.
Eleanor E. Maccoby, a psychologist at Stanford University, favors a simpler
explanation for the earlier sexual activity and pregnancies of girls from
troubled families: that they receive less parental supervision.;    Terrie
Moffitt, a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin and co-author with
Belsky of one key study, believes that a hidden factor may be the mothers' age
of puberty, a factor that was not studied in his research.;    "It's a genetic
fact that girls tend to have the same age of menarche as their mothers,"
Moffitt said. "And it is also true that the earlier a girl develops sexually,
the earlier, on average, she will date and marry. And those who marry earliest
tend to have made the worst marital choices.";    In analyzing data from a
study of 501 girls in New Zealand, Moffitt found that of the 81 girls who
reached puberty at 12 or earlier, 40 had grown up in households in which the
father was absent for many years, most because of divorce.;    But of the 82
girls who did not reach puberty until age 14 or later, only 20 had fathers who
were absent.;    From turbulent homes;  Belsky also cites a study of 1,123
girls published in 1990 by Dr. Michele Surbey, a psychologist at the
University of Toronto. Surbey found that those girls who had gone through
childhood in homes where their parents were fighting and finally divorced had
menarche about four months earlier, on average, than girls from homes with
little conflict.;    However, in preliminary analysis of data from 4,800 girls
in Britain, Dr. Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University,
found no difference in the age of menarche between girls whose parents had and
had not divorced.;    To many social scientists who have studied teen-age
pregnancies, seeking the causes in evolution seems fanciful.;    The
conclusion of University of Pennsylvania sociologist Elijah Anderson,
published earlier this year, is that the more immediate cause of teen-age
sexuality and pregnancy is to be found in a lack of jobs, which leaves many
poor teen-agers with little sense that their futures hold any promise.  </TEXT>

CHILD'S 'BEST INTERESTS' GUIDE JUDGES' DECISIONS;

<P>
Children often find themselves in the middle of a tug of war when their parents 
get divorced. 
</P>
<P>
The scene is played out thousands of times a year in courtrooms across the 
country: A man and a woman realize that their crumbling marriage cannot be 
saved, so one or each of them files for divorce. If they have children, custody 
becomes an issue. And when both parents want custody, the result is often an 
emotional battle in which their kids are caught in the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks he or she is acting in the best interests of the child," said 
Dr. Stephen P. Herman, a child and adolescent psychiatrist with a practice in 
Connecticut and New York. "But unfortunately, that's not always the case." 
</P>
<P>
Acting in a child's best interests is a legal requirement in child-custody 
cases. Moreover, it is being used as a guide to address emerging trends such as 
surrogate parents, unmarried parents, homosexual couples, frozen embryos and 
grandparents' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Determining a child's best interests is a delicate and frequently complicated 
procedure in which lawyers, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers all 
make recommendations that are considered by a judge before he or she makes a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of these experts are made after extensive interviews or 
counseling sessions with the parents and, usually separately, their children. 
Mental health experts are frequently called upon to testify for one side or the 
other, but sometimes the court will appoint its own expert to ensure impartial 
testimony. After weighing all the factors in a custody case, the judge will 
make a decision based on the Best Interests Standard, which has become the 
guide by which custody cases are decided. 
</P>
<P>
The Best Interests Standard, which Herman called "the guiding presumption of 
the courts today," has been in use for about 40 years and differs significantly 
from previous standards, in which the sex of the parent was the determining 
factor in almost all such cases. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of civilization, children were considered the 'property' of the 
father," Herman said. "This was laid down by Roman law and continued through 
the Renaissance until the last part of the 19th Century." 
</P>
<P>
By that time, children were no longer considered property; instead, they were 
viewed as "little people" who would be better cared for by their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Mothers were then seen as the so-called 'better-fit' parents," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
That led to the adoption of the Tender Years Doctrine, a legal standard that 
almost always gave custody of young children to their mothers. After the 
children turned 7, however, they were often returned to their fathers. 
</P>
<P>
"This really could have been very disruptive," Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
For this and other reasons, notably the constitutional guarantee of equal 
protection under the law, the Best Interests Standard was established just 
after World War II and has since become what Herman called "the major trend 
that forms judicial opinion" in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
Although judges are guided by this standard, Herman added, "there is, in fact, 
a strong feeling among judges that mothers are better parents, especially of 
younger kids." 
</P>
<P>
This, he said, is borne out by the fact that in most cases, the mother gets 
custody of the children. Although there is no one organization or agency that 
compiles nationwide custody statistics, according to Herman and other 
professionals interviewed for this story, they all said that mothers get 
custody in the vast majority of uncontested cases, perhaps as much as 90% of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Stanley Novack, who has heard child-custody cases at Superior Court in 
Stamford, Conn., for the past 15 years, disagrees with Herman, saying that 
while mothers often get custody of their children, it is not because judges 
think they are better parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It does work out in many cases that the mother gets the child," Novack said. 
"But that is based on relationship. One of the factors to consider is, who is 
the psychological parent? To which parent is the child bonded? In many cases 
the child is bonded to his or her mother because he or she is with the mother 
most of the day. In that case the woman may get custody, but not simply because 
she is the mother." 
</P>
<P>
Novack also points out that since the institution of the Best Interests 
Standard, a greater number of fathers are winning custody. And he agrees with 
Herman that while mothers are still more likely to get custody, fathers win "a 
large percentage" of contested cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Women win a large number of custody cases that are uncontested," Herman said. 
"But when fathers decide to fight it, they win a good deal of the time. I'd say 
about 50%." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most difficult decision a judge has to make in a custody case is 
whether to give one parent sole custody or to award joint custody. Novack says 
that there are two kinds of joint custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Joint legal custody is when both parents share the decision-making about their 
child or children," he said. "Joint physical custody is when both parents share 
blocks of time with their children." 
</P>
<P>
Joint legal custody is common in situations where the children of a divorced 
couple live primarily with one parent, even though the other parent may have 
visitation rights or has been allowed to take the children for weekends, 
vacations or holidays.

When Kim, a young woman in Southern California, decided to have a baby, she 
assumed that the child would be hers to bring up as she pleased. After all, she 
was not married to the baby's father, and by the time the baby was born she and 
her boyfriend had irrevocably parted. 
</P>
<P>
But her boyfriend thought otherwise, and the courts agreed. To Kim's dismay, 
the baby's father was awarded joint physical custody -- the baby boy must spend 
part of each week with his father and part with his mother. Kim has a stormy 
and bitter relationship with her former boyfriend. She said she fears for her 
baby's emotional well-being if he grows up splitting his time between parents 
who are so angry with each other. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts don't seem to be interested in a child's emotional and physical 
well-being," Kim said. "As the judge put it, he's looking for 'cigarette burns, 
bruises and broken bones.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No One's Best Interest 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Judith Wallerstein, executive director of the Center for the 
Family in Transition in Corte Madera, Calif., emphatically agrees with Kim 
that, in her case, joint physical custody is not in the best interest of 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein and her colleagues have recently completed a study showing that 
joint physical custody is detrimental to children of divorce if their parents 
are warring. Even if the parents have an amicable relationship, joint custody 
has no effect on the emotional health of the children or on how parents adjust 
to the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
These findings on joint custody are based on three recent studies by 
Wallerstein and her colleagues. One experiment at Wallerstein's center looked 
at how children adjust to custody arrangements made voluntarily by parents. The 
researchers studied 101 children from a well-educated, middle-class suburban 
community for two years after their parents' divorce. 
</P>
<P>
In about one-third of the families, the parents had voluntarily selected joint 
custody. From a standard battery of tests and clinical interviews, the 
researchers concluded that joint custody makes no difference in these 
children's psychological well-being. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boys Not Helped 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein was particularly disappointed that such joint-custody families did 
not help boys. Many therapists and social scientists have hoped that boys' 
longing for their fathers could be assuaged by joint custody. 
</P>
<P>
A second experiment, led by Stanford University sociologist Janet Johnston, 
looked at 100 families from mixed social and economic classes who were engaged 
in bitter divorces. One-third of the children were in joint custody and the 
rest in sole custody. The researchers found that joint custody was actually 
worse for the children than sole custody. 
</P>
<P>
Girls, in particular, were hurt by these forced arrangements, Wallenstein said. 
"No longer part of her mother's protective orbit," the girl "loses her value 
and her identity as her mother's psychological extension and close ally and 
becomes instead either the fantasy rival, the fantasy traitor -- tainted by 
contact with the enemy -- or both." As a consequence, the girl "has protection 
nowhere," Wallerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
A third experiment, led by psychologist William Coysh, examined the parents of 
middle-class families to see whether custody arrangements made a difference in 
how parents adjusted to divorce. "One of the most persuasive arguments for 
joint custody has been that fathers feel much better about themselves and are 
better parents when they undertake joint custody of their children," 
Wallerstein said. But she was surprised by the result: Custody arrangements had 
no effect. 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein said the findings "are not an argument against joint custody, but 
they also are not an argument that it will benefit the child." 
</P>
<P>
These results may not surprise experts in family studies, but they are 
politically difficult because they could take away from the gains of fathers' 
rights groups, which have argued for joint custody as a major way for fathers 
to have access to their children. Starting in the late 1970s, joint custody 
became an option for the divorce courts in most states. 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein's research flies in the face of the conventional wisdom that 
children of divorce do better if they split their time between their parents. 
Not surprisingly, many divorced men have hotly contested her findings. Some 
contend that the study was too small in scope and looked at the parents and 
children for too short a time to be conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Many divorced men think Wallerstein's findings do not bode well for fathers 
seeking custody. If the courts are persuaded that joint physical custody is 
detrimental, they fear, sole custody will go to the mothers. 
</P>
<P>
James Cook, president of the Joint Custody Assn., a group with 3,000 members in 
43 states, said half-jokingly that "a natural extrapolation" of Wallerstein's 
study is that more fathers should get sole custody. But, he added, "I think 
that's not likely in today's society." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappointing Findings 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein is disappointed that her findings were not more optimistic. "It 
would be nice to feel that we could cut into a child's unhappiness." Children 
of divorce are often unhappy and troubled, regardless of what sort of custody 
arrangements are in place, Wallerstein said. She said she thinks the focus for 
the children of divorced parents should be on individual relationships with 
each parent, not custody issues. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers think that the most important influence on the emotional health of 
children is the quality of their relationships within their family, however 
that family might be structured, said Robert Emery, a psychologist at the 
University of Virginia. For example, psychologists used to think that boys 
needed their father within the home until at least age 7 or 8. Now they have 
discovered that the physical presence of a father in the family is less 
important to boys than are warm and supporting adults. 
</P>
<P>
This shift occurred "partly in recognition of the changing American family and 
the changing demographics of divorce. It is an appreciation of plurality," 
Emery said. But the focus on relationships also means that if divorced parents 
are angry and bitter, children will suffer and they will suffer more if they're 
exposed more to the conflict through joint custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the child feels accepted or rejected is very important," Wallerstein 
said. "But custody doesn't convey that. It is a much more subtle, much more 
elusive issue of how the child perceives himself within the family."

CHILD'S RIGHTS NEED RESPECT TOO

The No. 1 cause of death in children under the age of 1 is child abuse. In our 
media-saturated society, publicized cases of abuse tend to cloud the reality of 
the problem. Grim details and horrific tales of a deranged abuser give the 
image that the problem is only prevalent where there is a severely disturbed 
parent, such as the Orange County woman who ran over her baby with the car and 
pleaded postpartum depression as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the individual who is not overtly aggressive? Do we stop to 
consider the thousands of people that lead "normal" lives and beat their 
children as a form of punishment or a release of their own frustrations? We 
cannot turn our backs and say, "Well, I don't abuse children." Child abuse is 
not an individual's problem. It is society's problem. We need to work together 
to give children a life free of emotional and physical abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Child abuse appears in two general forms: physical abuse and emotional abuse. 
Physical abuse can and does consist of slapping, punching, biting, burning, 
scratching and sexual molestation. This mistreatment can both maim and kill a 
child. Emotional abuse, which is the most difficult to detect, is a subtle, 
insidious destruction of a child's self-esteem and psychological sense of self. 
This form of abuse can be the most dangerous to a child's psyche. A child that 
is constantly intimidated, belittled and neglected is going to have trouble 
interacting with peers, authority figures and society in general. An abused 
child has severe difficulty growing emotionally; this often leads to 
psychological problems later in life. 
</P>
<P>
Most abused children will not report their own suffering, fearing further abuse 
from their persecutor. Unexplained bruises, welts and burns, children who are 
consistently uncared for and hungry, abrupt changes in behavior and prolonged 
listlessness are all possible signs of child abuse and should be questioned. If 
abuse is reasonably suspected, a national referral service is readily available 
at (800) 4-A-CHILD. 
</P>
<P>
In order for a child to be freed from this suffering, the abuse must be 
reported. However, once the report is made, the situation can sometimes go from 
bad to worse. Abused children tend to develop a love-hate relationship with the 
abuser. Often an abused child will be removed from the home screaming for the 
same person that was abusing him or her, since the child prefers "hell" to the 
unknown. A child may also protect the abuser and deny the abuse in an attempt 
to win love or out of fear of the wrath that may result in admitting to the 
suffering. The child's hesitation to report the details is further complicated 
by the fact that the legal system is usually intent on reuniting a family. 
</P>
<P>
As a therapist, I cannot express how painful it is to help children protect 
themselves when the law cannot. By focusing intently on a parent's rights, the 
law often returns abused children to the parents, resulting in further abuse, 
and sometimes death. A child's rights must be considered to be equally 
important, if not more important, as a parent's, if only for the fact that a 
child is defenseless against an adult. A recent case in Orange County shows the 
court's focus on parental rights and family reunification. 
</P>
<P>
A father had been abusing his 7-year-old daughter through repeated physical 
beatings, verbal harassment and sexual molestation. Once the abuse was reported 
and proven, the law intervened to separate the father and the child. 
</P>
<P>
After the separation, the courts wanted to give the father another chance -- 
even though there had been documented evidence of verbal, physical and sexual 
abuse. The father was allowed unsupervised, off-grounds visitation rights and 
the abuse continued. When it was finally realized that abuse was still 
occurring, the father was restricted to supervised visitations. This child 
suffered needless pain and psychological damage -- that may be irreversible -- 
in order to preserve the parent's rights. But what about the child's rights? 
Our legal system is so intent on reunification that it will be recommended even 
when it is not in the child's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
Why should a child's rights take a back seat to the parents'? Child-abuse 
legislation needs a change of focus. Parents should not always have the 
ultimate right, and reunification is not always the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that once a family is reunited, child abuse usually occurs 
again. Children deserve the legal right not to be abused. 
</P>
<P>
Our courts need to set some precedence regarding children's rights. We need to 
offer alternatives and counseling to abusive parents, as well as the children. 
It must also be realized that depression and alcoholism do not relieve parents 
of their responsibilities.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Hear Appeal of Jehovah's Witness in Florida Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear the
appeal of a Florida woman who says she was denied custody of her
young child because she is a Jehovah's Witness.
   The justices, without comment, let stand state court rulings
that bar Rita Mendez from exposing her daughter to any of her
religious beliefs.
   The state courts also awarded primary residential custody of the
girl to her father.
   In the appeal acted on today, Mrs. Mendez said her
freedom-of-religion rights were violated by the custody
determination.
   Rita and Ignacio Mendez were divorced in Miami in 1985, after a
four-year marriage. Their daughter, Rebecca, was then 3.
   Marital difficulties arose in 1983 over Mrs. Mendez's
involvement with the Jehovah's Witnesses religion. Her husband is a
Catholic who, according to court documents, felt his wife had
``betrayed him'' by joining the Jehovah's Witnesses.
   At a custody trial, Mendez testfieid that it was not in
Rebecca's best interest to be raised as a Jehovah's Witness. Of the
485 pages in the divorce proceedings transcript devoted to child
custody, 249 pages contain references to the subject of religion.
   Two psychologists and one psychiatrist testified that Rebecca
should live with her mother, whom they called the child's ``prime
parent figure.''
   But the experts said contact with her mother's Jehovah's Witness
religion was not in Rebecca's best interest because she needs ``to
adapt herself to the mainstream of culture.''
   They testified that a Catholic upbringing ``would allow her to
adapt to society and have the freedom that Catholic children have
in the society.''
   Judge Phillip K. Knight, in awarding primary custody of Rebecca
to her father, ruled that Mrs. Mendez should enjoy ``regular,
frequent and liberal visitation, access and contact with the minor
child.''
   But he also barred Mrs. Mendez from exposing Rebecca to ``any
religious practices, attendances, teachings or events which are in
any way inconsistent with the religious teachings and practices of
the Catholic religion.''
   A state appeals court upheld the custody award, ruling that
``the record in this case does not support (Mrs. Mendez's)
contention that the trial court made the father the primary
residential parent ... solely because the mother is a practicing
Jehovah's Witness.''
   In a dissenting vote, one appeals court judge said granting the
father primary custody amounted to ``an abuse of discretion.''
   ``The child, exposed to the religious views of both parents for
two years, showed no evidence of emotional or psychological harm,''
the judge said, adding that the custody proceedings showed ``the
experts' personal biases against the mother's religion.''
   ``Their disdain for the mother's religion induced them to
speculate as to the possibility of harm to the child in the future
even though no evidence of harm existed,'' the dissenting judge
said.
   Lawyers for Mrs. Mendez told the justices, ``This court cannot
eliminate religious bigotry in America but it can and should review
this decision, which has deprived a parent of her child because of
intolerance of her faith.''
   The appeal added, ``The trial court's order places Rita in the
anomalous position of having a constitutionally protected right to
speak to total strangers about her religion but not to her own
child.''
   The case is Mendez vs. Mendez, 87-1166.

<HEADLINE>  WHERE HAVE ALL THE TELEVISION MOMMIES GONE?  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Mothers, in case you hadn't noticed, are biting the dust in prime-time
comedies.;    Lately, there has been a weird sort of post-feminist backlash in
television's depiction of the American family, and the message is hardly
subliminal: If Mom's not going to stick around in the kitchen, then -- poof --
let's dump her.;    Sometimes, she has up and walked out (as in "Blossom," to
pursue a singing career, or as in "Wings," to serve time in prison for
embezzlement). Usually, though, she's dead, the victim of a car crash.;   
And, riotously or not, a hapless Dad, a la "Mr. Mom," is left to fend for
himself and the kids, often with the help of a male in-law.;    In ABC's
sleeper "Full House," a father, his boyish-looking brother-in-law and his pal,
who does a lot of Popeye imitations, do their heartwarming best to look after
three girls.;    "The Family Man" on CBS stars Gregory Harrison as a
firefighter who, with his father-in-law, raises four children.;    The Judith
Ivey series, "Down Home," and "Empty Nest," both on NBC, feature widowed
fathers dealing with their grown children.;    The Fox network has a new
father-son show called "Top of the Heap," a spinoff of "Married . . . With
Children" that stars Joe Bologna.;    Motherless families have long been a
staple of American television.;    Think back to the Ponderosa days of Pa and
Hoss on "Bonanza." Then there were "My Three Sons," "Bachelor Father," "The
Courtship of Eddie's Father" and "Family Affair.";    Then, for a while, TV
moved closer to mirroring reality with fatherless series, most notably "One
Day at a Time" and "Kate and Allie.";    So why the resurgence now? Why are so
many television mothers missing? Is TV reflecting the culture, or offering a
fantasy? Could Marge Simpson be the next to go?;    "I shudder to think what
would happen if Marge weren't there to keep Homer from killing the kids," says
Matt Groening, creator of "The Simpsons," who has as keen an eye as anyone in
television for how dysfunctional families work.;    "In our culture, fathers
have schemed their way out of familial duties. These sitcoms without mothers
finally force them to do the parental thing.";    In truth, of course, most
American children are still being cared for by their mothers, not their
fathers, even though the majority of mothers work outside the home.;    But
the current rash of shows without mothers can be traced to a confluence of
psychological, sociological and economic factors, including the exploitation
of every working mother's most basic guilt about deserting her children and
the flip side of that -- a child's fear of abandonment caused by women's
changing roles in society.;    Television, says child psychologist Judith
Wallerstein, is simply ahead of the social sciences in reflecting an emotional
truth, if not reality.;    Wallerstein, who is co-author, with Sandra
Blakeslee, of "Second Chances: Men, Women and Children a Decade After
Divorce," explains that a rising interest in father-child relationships has
been sparked by the fact that the mother's role has changed because of both
divorce and work.;    "The issue of mother as she used to be is vanishing,"
Wallerstein continues.;    "The children I see of divorces complain of this
all the time: 'There's nobody home. I come home to an empty house.' These
children are full of compassion about how hard Mom is working, so their anger
is inhibited by the compassion. But the sense of the mother not being there
accurately reflects the psychological experience and the longing and the
anger.";    Wallerstein points to recent data showing that about 90 percent of
children from divorced households live with their mothers, many of whom are
beset by financial problems.;    But depending on custody arrangements, more
fathers are spending time alone with their children, and in two-career
marriages, fathers by necessity tend to be more involved parents.;    "What
these TV programs seem to be giving us," she says, "is a sense of the
vanishing mother," both symbolically and in reality.  </TEXT>

<HL> Children -- Coping With Change: Kids Are Often Losers in Joint Custody --- Constant Moves Between Parents Produce Strains </HL>

<TEXT>
      {Second of a Series}
   Meet the new kids on the block: two-household children. 

   Four-year-old Ryan Padwo of Baltimore lives with Dad on Mondays and Tuesdays, with Mom on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and alternates the rest of the week with each of them. 
Asked by his mother if he wants to spend more time with his father, Ryan replies: "No, Mom, I want this to be fair for each of you." 

   Seven-year-old Jessica Toplin shuttles back and forth between her separated parents four times a week. 
"I wish I could just split myself in half," the Philadelphia youngster once told them. 
And then there's Amy, a 16-year-old who alternates weeks with her divorced parents, who live 30 miles apart. 
The Baltimore-area teen-ager, tagged "bag lady" by classmates because she often totes her clothes with her to school, says she's disappointed she can't see her friends more often. 
"My life is more complex, but it's worth it to see my dad," she says. 

   Children of divorced parents used to live with Mom and see Dad every other weekend. 
But with more mothers working and many fathers seeking a greater role in parenting, custody arrangements have become more flexible, producing some children who live out of suitcases, have their own frequent-flier cards and keep personal calendars taped to two refrigerator doors. 
For them, Saturday baseball leagues or piano lessons are often out of the question since weekend schedules are just too crazy. 
It's the price they pay to be equal children to parents who have gone separate ways. 

   Psychologists and child-custody specialists agree that joint or more-flexible sole custody agreements should be beneficial in assuring children that they haven't lost either parent. 
"How could a kid be harmed because both parents want to spend a lot of time with him?" asks Lynn Gold-Bilkin, a lawyer in Philadelphia. 

   But such arrangements often work better on paper than in practice. 
Even when the divorce is amicable, the simple logistics -- deciding who takes the child to and from school, to the dentist, and on shopping trips -- are difficult enough. 
It's doubly hard when anger and bitterness linger between the couple. 

   "The question is: Can you get along better after the divorce than before?" asks Albert J. Solnit, former director of the Yale University Child Studies Center. 
He believes that since a child remains close to both parents in a shared-custody arrangement, it's especially important for them to put aside their hurt and not undermine each other's parental role. 

   "Joint-custody arrangements sound so wonderful. 
Everything is in the 'best interest of the child,'" notes Clare Robinson, a child psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic. 
But, she adds, too often the child becomes "a secondary consideration" for parents unwilling to care for kids full time or to bear the full financial burden. 

   For the child, the most direct impact of dividing time between parents is having to physically shuttle back and forth. 
"It makes me dizzy," says Michelle Black, an eight-year-old from Kingsville, Md. 
Although her mother has sole custody, she spends the school year with her mother, summers with her father, and alternate weekends at both houses. 
"Sometimes I don't know where I'm going," she says. 
"Sometimes I'm confused about whose house I'm supposed to be at." 

   Such moves are also exhausting. 
Last year, Bryce Hatch, director of pupil services at public schools in Upper St. Clair, Pa., near Pittsburgh, noticed that a few children were falling asleep Monday mornings. 
Each had flown in late Sunday night or early Monday morning from weekend visits with a parent. 
"I think the parents' problems are so great they don't realize what they're doing to the kids," he says. 

   Judith Wallerstein, a Palo Alto, Calif., divorce researcher and clinical psychologist, worries about the effect on young children who may equate the shuttling as being sent away for bad behavior. 
Donald Freidheim, a Cleveland child psychologist, recalls a six-year-old boy, who commuted every other week between Cleveland and Philadelphia. 
The boy appeared introverted and preoccupied with drawing pictures of black clouds. 
Those clouds started to disappear after the parents agreed he could stay longer with each parent. 

   Older children find the constant shifts disquieting as well. 
"I don't really feel like I have a home," says 16-year-old Laura. 
When her parents first separated, she lived with each for two weeks at a time. 
Then it was a month with each, and now she's living with her father until the Christmas holidays and then switches to her mother's. 

   "You have to be different for each parent. 
Mom is more lenient than Dad. 
So you behave differently. 
I don't have any sense of stability," says Laura, who admits to being "really depressed" at times. 

   For most two-household children, each home has a different personality and rules. 
One may use wheat bread, the other white. 
Bedtime is 8 p.m. at one house, and 9 at another. 
One young girl notes that soap operas are taboo at Dad's but OK at Mom's. 
While such differences may seem minor, they're often disquieting, specialists say. 

   Ms. Robinson, the psychologist, says that to cope, children tailor their behavior to their environment. 
Ryan Padwo's room at his mother's home is filled with stuffed animals while super heroes fill his room at his father's. 
"It's like he has two separate identities," says his mother, adding: "I'm the read-the-book parent. 
His father is the play parent." 

   Understandably, children often feel caught in the middle since each parent has a say in their upbringing. 
"When I'm at Dad's, I ask him if I can do something. 
When I go back to Mom's and tell her, she wonders, 'Why didn't you ask me?'" says one 16-year-old girl. 
She asks: "Am I supposed to call back over there every time I need to do something?" 

   Risa Garon, a social worker, says constant shuttling makes it easier for parents and children to gloss over rather than solve problems. 
"It acts like an escape valve. 
When things get rough, you can pick up and go to the other house," she says. 
"Or when you start to work things out, it's time to pack up and leave. 
The continuity isn't there." 

   Ms. Garon, who runs a support group for children of divorced parents in Columbia, Md., says that children too often get tangled up in their parents' bitterness. 
She cites a recent picnic where, even though a boy and his father were having a great time when his mother arrived at 6 p.m., she "demanded the child leave because it was 'transfer time.'" 
And she says some parents have left a child with a baby sitter or at friend's home while they traveled on business because "it's not the other parent's week." 

   Ellen and Rick Toplin opted for joint custody because they believed Jessica needed both parents. 
"I couldn't be Jessica's mother and equally Ellen couldn't be Jessica's father," says Rick. 
There were also selfish motivations. 
Both have demanding careers and, says Ellen, "neither of us wanted to let go of her." 

   They've split everything evenly, even alternating years to claim Jessica as a tax deduction. 
They bail each other out in emergencies: If Jessica gets sick at school and the parent who has Jessica can't pick her up, the other parent steps in. 
"We get along better now than when we were married," says Ellen. 

   There are annoyances, of course. 
Vacations are hard to schedule, and it's bothersome having to check with each other before doing anything -- even scheduling a teacher's meeting. 
They've also had to battle well-meaning teachers, parents and even their marriage counselor who questioned their joint-custody decision. 

   "We had to fight against the odds," says Ellen. 
"But it's worth it. 
Jessica may have lost her family, but we didn't want her losing her parents."

<LEADPARA>  CHILDREN who are held, cuddled and showered with hugs and kisses are more apt
to grow into successful adults than those who "learn discipline" at an early
age, psychologists say.;    Following up on studies conducted 36 years earlier
on a group of 5-year-olds in Boston, the researchers say parental warmth has
more influence on adult social adjustment than any other factor.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WARMTH FROM DADS HELPS CHILDREN ADJUST AS
ADULTS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Family  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Although warmth from both parents is significant in a child's ultimate
success, the results lend particularly strong support to the notion that a
father's manner is important to development.;    The study compared mothers'
assessments of the way 5-year-olds were raised in 1951 with the psychological
and social well-being of those same children in 1987.;    "Adults whose
mothers and fathers were warm and affectionate were able to sustain long and
relatively happy marriages, raise children and be involved with friends and
recreational activities outside their marriage at midlife," the authors
concluded in a report released Wednesday in the Journal of Personality and
Social Psychology.;    In comparison, children of cold parents were more
likely to be depressed.;    On the other hand, contrary to the authors'
predictions, there was no significant correlation between "difficult
childhoods" or "parental harmony" and ultimate success.;    Original
information on the manners in which the 5-year-olds were being reared in 1951
was conducted by a team of Harvard University psychologists who interviewed
mothers and teachers of 379 kindergarten-aged children.;    The mothers were
asked to rate the amount of parental affection the child received in terms of
"hugs, kisses, holding and cuddling.";    Both mothers and kindergarten
teachers rated each child on how well he or she got along with other
children.;    In 1987, psychologists Carol Franz and David McClelland of
Boston University and Joel Weinberger of Adelphi University located 78 percent
of the original group for follow-up interviews.;    Their study is the first
to look at the long-term influence of parental warmth on the development of
social skills in adults.;    The researchers used complex statistical
calculations to draw associations between measurements of parental warmth
recorded in 1951 and measurements of social success 36 years later.;    The
"most important finding," they wrote, was a significant association between
cases in which mothers reported parental warmth in child rearing in 1951 and
the child's conventional social accomplishments at age 41.;    The term
"conventional social accomplishments" referred basically to an adult's ability
to maintain a marriage and friendships.;    "It was especially interesting
that father warmth was meaningfully related to later social accomplishment,"
they said. "These results provide more support for the notion that a father's
contribution to his child's well-being is important.";    Children whose
mothers saw them as sociable were not more likely to have higher levels of
social accomplishment.;    On the other hand, girls who did not seek lot of
help from their teachers and boys who got along well with their peers were
higher in social accomplishment.;    There was an odd relationship between a
girl's social class and her ultimate psychological success as an adult, the
psychologists reported: Women from middle-class families tended to be lower in
social accomplishment than women from lower-class families.;    "Perhaps
middle-class women, who were also more likely to get more education than
lower-class women, were more susceptible to cultural messages of the time
regarding alternative roles for women," the authors observed.;    Lower-class
women, on the other hand, may have had fewer options and therefore saw
traditional lifestyles more positively, the researcher suggested.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Child Turns 7 In Hiding As Custody Fight Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GINSBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilary Antonia Foretich turned 7 last week in
hiding, with her father marking the birthday at a subdued Capitol
Hill ceremony and her mother nearing two years in jail for refusing
to disclose the little girl's whereabouts.
   Hilary has been missing for two years on Monday, since a
Washington judge ordered her mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, to
surrender the youngster for unsupervised visits with her father.
Morgan refused to comply and remains in jail on contempt of court
charges.
   Morgan claims that Hilary's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, sexually
abused the girl. Foretich vehemently denies the allegation and
contends that his former wife is suffering from delusions.
   While the parents' struggle continues, mental health
professionals are questioning whether Hilary can survive the ordeal
without emotional scars.
   ``For any child, a separation from both parents on an abrupt and
sudden basis is very harmful and could cause serious long-term
consequences,'' said Dr. Jerry Wiener, president of the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. ``There's no way that
she could not be significantly affected from this experience, and I
would think that any effects could not be undone.''
   Constance Ahrons, a noted California psychologist in the field of
child custody cases and author of the book ``Divorced Families,''
said Hilary's separation from her parents could leave the child
feeling isolated, even under protective custody.
   ``This is bound to have a profound effect on her,'' Ahrons said.
``If she was close to her parents, she may feel abandoned. In a case
like this, the child is the most vulnerable because of her age and
because she has no control in what happens to her.''
   Linda Holman, Hilary's court-appointed attorney, declined to be
interviewed and said she refuses all media requests for interviews
concerning this case. She said such interviews ``contribute to the
long-term negative impact on Hilary.''
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon has said
Morgan will remain in jail for contempt of court until she
surrenders Hilary.
   A three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals,
the city's highest local court, ordered that Morgan be released.
However, the entire court overturned that decision on Aug. 21 _
Hilary's seventh birthday _ and ordered a new hearing on the case
before the full court next month.
   That same day, Foretich and about a dozen family members and
friends marked his daughter's birthday with a small ceremony on the
steps of the Capitol. Legislation passed by the House and awaiting a
vote by the full Senate would limit the length of contempt jailings
in the nation's capital and, in effect, free Morgan.
   Later that same day, Foretich told The Associated Press he thinks
Hilary is suffering through an experience that could ultimately lead
to an early death.
   ``If my daughter is not brought back within the near future, it
will be too late. She will lose her ability to ever recover from
this,'' he said. ``I knew her to be a resilient child, but at some
point that resilience is going to fade. I don't want my daughter to
be an example, another statistic, of a teen-age suicide because she
feels abandoned by both parents and has been led to believe that her
father is a pervert and her mother is a crazy woman.''
   Morgan did not respond to a written request for an interview
relayed through jail officials.
   However, Mary Froning, a child psychologist who treated Hilary
for two years at her mother's request, said the only hardship that
the young girl has undergone is being apart from her mother for so
long.
   ``Her ordeal is being separated from her mother, the only person
in the world she trusts,'' Froning said. ``She is with the people
she chose to be with, so I have every reason to believe she is
safe.''
   Wiener, however, wondered whether the one-way communication that
he presumes Hilary receives isn't hurting the girl.
   ``One presumes she is told positive things about her mother and
negative things about her father,'' Weiner said. ``That is not
constructive, not at all.''
   Ahrons said she also was concerned that some problems could
result from the girl acting as a fugitive to disguise her real
identity.
   ``There are certainly possible problems with issues concerning
her own identity,'' said Ahrons. ``It could have some effect on her
life. A profound effect? Who knows?''
   Foretich has his own theory. ``At what point will Hilary cease to
even know who she is?'' he asked.
   ``I mean, how many times has her name been changed, has her hair
been colored? Does she even know who she is anymore? Her self-image
will soon be destroyed, if it hasn't already happened.''

<TEXT>
   A little more than a year ago, in the
darkest days of winter, Laura Lynn Lazarovich lay in a hospital bed
fighting for life.
   Her skull was fractured, her right side paralyzed, her right arm
and collarbone snapped like twigs. Two front teeth had been gouged
out, both her hazel eyes were swollen shut, dried blood caked her
lips, and her body was mottled with bruises from forehead to ankles.
   A monitor watched over her heart. Intravenous tubes sprouted
from her pitifully broken body.
   Laura Lynn was 2{ years old.
   Prosecutors say her tormentors were her parents.
   Moreover, this was the child's third fractured skull in 28
months. Laura Lynn was a double victim, not only of especially
brutal beatings, but also of a bureaucratic bungle that returned
her home for the last, almost fatal attack.
   Even as assault charges were pending in New Jersey against her
parents, Roger and Janice Lazarovich, a Family Court judge there
had ordered her returned from the temporary custody of her maternal
grandparents to the Lazaroviches in Massachusetts.
   Now the law has caught up with the Lazaroviches, who had Laura
Lynn and two sons over three years, moved three times from three
states and were divorced in February.
   Today, both are in jail: Lazarovich, 25, is serving 15-20 years
after his conviction for mayhem and assault; his 23-year-old wife,
who had been scheduled to stand trial on the same charges May 2,
won a delay last week and will be tried in September.
   Superior Court Judge Charles Alberti, with 16 years on the
bench, said in sentencing Laura Lynn's father, ``I don't know if
I've dealt with a case, by virtue of this child's tender years,
where the child has been more brutalized.''
   The two still face extradition to New Jersey on two counts of
aggravated assault, according to Camden County prosecutor Sam
Asbell.
   The Lazaroviches drove 20 miles through heavy snow that
Saturday, Jan. 24, 1987, to bring their unconscious daughter from
their western Massachusetts trailer home to a Pittsfield hospital.
They said she had ``fallen off her potty seat,'' according to court
papers.
   But prosecutors said she had been beaten for more than a week.
Court papers said she was bitten, choked and her head slammed
repeatedly into a countertop from about Jan. 16 to Jan. 24.
   Laura Lynn's maternal grandmother, Pamela Christopher, could not
recognize the battered child when she visited her in the hospital
several days later. ``She didn't look like the little girl who had
left us,'' recalled Mrs. Christopher, who with her husband, Arthur,
had cared for the girl about a year.
   Mrs. Christopher asked if she could hold her, thinking it might
be for the last time. ``I questioned whether she would live,'' she
recalled. ``They had to prop her up to put her in my lap.''
   Laura Lynn spent eight months in the hospital and a Boston
rehabilitation center. Upon her release in September, the courts
granted the Massachusetts Department of Social Services temporary
custody of the girl and her brothers, Anthony, 2{, and Timothy, 1{.
   Laura Lynn was placed in a foster home in western Massachusetts.
Her brothers are together in another home in the same region. The
Lazaroviches have not been granted visitation rights and say they
do not know their childen's whereabouts. No allegation of abuse of
the boys was ever raised.
   ``Laura Lynn is doing remarkably well,'' said Joseph Landolfi, a
spokesman for the social service department. ``The boys are in very
good shape.''
   Medical experts testified that Laura Lynn suffered permanent
damage in the beating, including partial paralysis of her right arm
and loss of peripheral vision in her left eye.
   After her release from the hospital, she began showing signs of
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which is most commonly seen among
combat veterans who relive war experiences and exhibit anxiety,
irritability and rage.
   In Laura Lynn's case, she took to hitting, kicking and biting
her foster parents. In court records, a psychologist who treated
Laura Lynn last December quoted the child as saying: ``I don't like
Mummy. Mummy hurts me. Mummy pinches me and kicks me and hits the
wall with me.'' Of her father, she was quoted as saying, ``Where's
my very bad Daddy?''
   Cynthia Monahon, the psychologist, said Laura Lynn's recovery
from injury has been encouraging and she has made unexpectedly
rapid developmental gains because of her resilience and
extraordinary care by her foster parents. She said Laura Lynn is
severely traumatized and has just begun to deal with the
psychological impact of her abuse.
   ``While she has formed solid attachments in her new family and
takes enormous pleasure in her new life, Laura remains an anxious,
demanding and, at times, oppositional little girl whose functioning
ranges from 2-to-2{ years of age,'' the psychologist wrote. Laura
Lynn will be 4 on Aug. 19.
   Roger and Janice Lazarovich were each adopted at the age of 20
months, Roger by John and Marilyn Lazarovich of Norwood, Mass.,
south of Boston, and Janice by the Christophers who live near
Camden, N.J., across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. Both
were bright, but few other childhood similarities exist. The
Christophers considered their daughter's marriage a mismatch.
   Both Roger and social workers describe his childhood as
tumultuous: He was given to exchanging blows and insults with his
mother, petty thefts and setting fires at home and at school.

<TEXT>
   When the world last looked, Bernice Albertine
King was a fidgety 5-year-old in white ribbons, piled sorrowfully
in her mother's lap at her father's 1968 funeral.
   Now, the baby daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is a
serene young woman, newly ordained as a Baptist minister and holder
of doctor of law and master of divinity degrees from Emory
University.
   Ms. King, 27, is the only one of the slain civil rights leader's
four children to follow her father's career and join the clergy.
She has a long-range goal of starting a prison ministry that also
would provide inmates with some legal counseling.
   The broader goal of continuing the sweeping social change begun
by her father is not on her agenda, Ms. King explains. But she
understands why people would take her entry into the ministry as a
sign that she intends to go in that direction.
   ``That's part of being who I am,'' she explains. ``I've learned
to live with that.
   ``My father was more concerned with sociology, the sociological
reasons for behavior,'' she says. ``I am more interested in the
psychological. I like to analyze things, to look at how things
happened to figure out why they happened.''
   Ms. King describes herself as an ambitious but private person.
She carries herself with an air so coolly serious that friends
often tell her she needs to lighten up.
   Ms. King said she might begin to do that _ after a summer of
reading the Bible, studying for bar exams and interviewing for jobs
with Atlanta-area law firms.
   She was ordained and received both her law and divinity degrees
all on the same day last month.
   Part of her serious nature, Ms. King said, stems from soul
searching in her early adulthood, when she ``spent a lot of time
running'' from the religious calling she felt at age 17.
   She thought briefly about a career as a television reporter. She
participated in some anti-apartheid protests, went to jail after
one of them. She also attended Democratic conventions, represented
her church at Baptist assemblies and spoke before the United
Nations.
   But by the time Ms. King earned a bachelor's degree in
psychology from Spelman College, she had a clearer idea of what she
wanted to do in life.
   She then enrolled at Emory and, in 1988, gave a trial sermon
that whipped into a weeping frenzy the congregation at Ebenezer,
the Baptist church presided over by both her father and grandfather.
   At her ordination, the Rev. Joseph L. Roberts, Ebenezer's pastor
and one of Ms. King's instructors at Emory, said she has ``not only
the oratorical gifts of her father but the sensitivity of her
father.''
   Ms. King said she considered taking broadcasting courses to
sharpen that powerful speaking ability.
   ``I always felt I needed to work on the way I choose words. I
still have difficulty with that,'' she said. ``And I've always
admired the way (broadcasters) speak.''

<LEADPARA>  LAST WEEK on "Designing Women," Mary Jo -- the cute, skinny, divorced one --
decided she wants to have another child before her biological clock runs out.
Her reasons were expressed purely in terms of personal gratification: The
happiest time of her life was when her children were babies and she now
"deserves" a new baby. She doesn't think she needs a husband, or that the baby
needs a father. Unsuccessfully seeking sperm from a former boyfriend, she
assured him, "It will just take a few minutes of your time.";    It struck me
that a show that tends to be heavy on politically correct message-sending was
broadcasting a socially devastating message: Babies are to make Mom happy; Dad
is disposable.;    In real life, a woman (or, more commonly, a girl) who has a
baby to meet her own emotional needs, with no regard for the child's needs,
tends to be a pretty miserable mother. And a father's job is not completed in
bed.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  KIDS ARE POOR WHEN DAD'S NOT AROUND  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Joanne Jacobs, who writes a column on Mondays and Thursdays, is a member of
the Mercury News editorial pages staff.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Kids Count, a Washington advocacy group, recently released results of its
national survey on the status of children. I'll summarize: Bad.;    In the
'80s, child poverty rose from 16 percent to 20 percent. The rate was 43.8
percent for blacks; 38.2 percent for Hispanic children.;    Why are so many
children poor? I'll summarize: No father.;    One in three families headed by
a single woman lives in poverty; the rate for married couples with children is
5 percent.;    More than 30 percent of blacks are living in poverty; most are
children. But for blacks who graduated from high school, got a job, got
married and stayed married, the poverty rate is 6 percent.;    Divorce has
leveled off at a historically high rate, while births to unwed teen-agers rose
from 7.5 percent in 1980 to 8.2 percent in 1988.;    In the wake of the
obvious failure of "do what feels right," the ideal of the two-parent family,
until recently as unfashionable as an avocado-colored kitchen, is making a
comeback.;    Speaking on "endangered children," Chester E. Finn Jr.,
professor of education and public policy at Vanderbilt University, zeroed in
on the failure of opinion leaders (and TV script writers are much more
powerful than Op-Ed columnists) to speak the "politically ticklish" truth:
"With rare exceptions . . . two-parent families are good for children,
one-parent families are bad, zero-parent families are horrible.";    Finn
calls it "astonishing" that knowing what we know about the dangers of
inadequate parenting, "we seem to attach more opprobrium to dropping out of
school, experimenting on a cat or uttering nasty remarks on campus than we do
to giving birth to what, not so many years ago, were called 'illegitimate'
children.";    In essence, society is sending the wrong message, Finn argues,
by failing to condemn what everybody knows to be dangerous behavior: having
kids without the security and support of marriage.;    Poverty isn't the only
problem. Many children today are being raised without the emotional support of
their fathers, without the model of a man who's demonstrably committed to his
marriage and his children.;    According to researchers, children of divorce
are more likely than children from intact families to have academic and
behavior problems in school, to abuse drugs, to require psychological
counseling; they are more prone to violent behavior, suicide and unwed
pregnancy. As adults, they are more likely to get divorced.;    Of course,
that doesn't mean all children from what used to be called "broken homes" will
have problems. I don't figure my kid to be a violent, suicidal, pregnant
drop-out, and I'm divorced. On the other hand, I'm not a single parent. My
daughter has two functioning parents.;    Children of divorce aren't
inevitably doomed to lose their fathers. Children who never had a father in
the family to begin with are in much worse shape.;    Of course, nobody really
knows how to get people to get married before they become parents.;   
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson has a highly controversial proposal to reward
teen-age welfare mothers who marry with an $80 a month bonus -- and to let the
married couple earn as much as $14,500 without losing welfare aid.;    Unwed
teen-age welfare mothers would receive the same benefits they do now for the
first child, but if a girl had more babies, she wouldn't get any more money.; 
  Not many guys will marry for $80 a month, but far more significant is that
Thompson's proposal removes the marriage penalty for low-earning couples.
Currently, a young welfare mother has to consider whether her child's father
can support a family of three. If he doesn't earn much, which is likely, the
system rewards her for staying single and on welfare. But he's a lot more
likely to stick around if the relationship is official.;    Thompson's
proposal has yet to be approved by the Wisconsin Legislature, and requires a
waiver by the Department of Health and Human Services.;    I'm bothered by
denying extra benefits for additional children. Whatever the mother's
mistakes, a child needs food, clothing and shelter.;    That aside, I'd like
to see Wisconsin experiment with rewarding marriage.;    It wouldn't do much
for a girl whose boyfriend has skipped out, and it wouldn't ensure that young
couples live happily ever after, but you can't have everything.;    And I
think Mary Jo should get herself a cute, cuddly Cabbage Patch doll.  </TEXT>

   Joint Custody Loses Favor for Increasing
   Children's Feeling of Being Torn Apart

   Joint custody, once hailed as the ideal child-rearing
arrangement for divorced couples, is coming under fire from
psychologists, lawyers and embittered parents.
   Joint-custody agreements, in which divorced parents share
custody of their children, became increasingly popular
throughout the 1980s. But many of these pacts are now
dissolving, and new studies suggest that early enthusiasm for
such arrangements was misguided.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Joint custody was going to be a great panacea, the
ultimate solution," says Gary N. Skoloff, chairman of the
American Bar Association's family law section. "Lawyers,
mediators, judges -- everyone said this was the way to save
the children. But it turned out to be the world's worst
situation. It was an experiment that failed."
   Robert Mnookin, director of the Stanford Center on
Conflict and Mediation, which conducted a child-custody study
of 1,100 families in California, says, "Where parents are
fighting and remain locked in conflict, joint physical
custody can be like carrying out King Solomon's threat. A
child can be torn apart psychologically."
   Few nationwide statistics on custody arrangements are
available. Researchers estimate that the proportion of
divorce cases settled with joint physical custody, in which
children alternate between the parents' residences, ranges
from 3% in Massachusetts to 18% in California. Joint legal
custody -- in which children have a single home but, in
contrast to sole custody, the parents share responsibility
for making important decisions -- is granted in up to 80% of
divorce cases.
   But these numbers may represent a peak. "Social-science
data in the past five years has started to question the
applicability of joint custody, especially when the parents
are battling," says Amy Koel, director of the Middlesex
Divorce Research Group in Cambridge, Mass., which studied
divorce cases in the area. "It's too early to say whether the
courts will change, but they do seem responsive to the
national mood" of skepticism toward joint custody.
   The theory behind joint custody was simple: Judges would
no longer have to choose between parents, families would no
longer have to endure bitter court battles, and children
would no longer feel that their non-custodial parents were
visitors in their lives. Experts believed joint-custody
arrangements would reduce litigation time and encourage
parental cooperation.
   But a study of 700 divorce cases in Cambridge by the
Middlesex Divorce Research Group found that couples with
joint legal custody were more than twice as likely to
relitigate their child-care agreements as couples with sole
custody.
   Moreover, joint legal custody "makes no difference in
terms of the amount of parents' contact with their kids, the
quality of communication between parents, or the rate of
compliance with child-support payments," says Stanford's Mr.
Mnookin.
   Researchers say joint custody hasn't lived up to its
promise because most parents haven't embraced the concept
willingly. When joint custody was introduced, only the most
dedicated, cooperative parents requested it -- and they were
determined to make the novel arrangement work. Initial
successes prompted lawyers, judges and mediators to push
other parents to try joint custody -- and even to impose it
on unwilling couples.
   Within a few years, many of these nonvoluntary settlements
collapsed. "The willingness to share hasn't struck a chord in
America," says Judith S. Wallerstein, a psychologist and
director of the Center for the Family in Transition in Corte
Madera, Calif.
   Imposed joint custody is common both in and out of court.
The Cambridge study found that judges rejected more than
one-third of fathers' and one-fifth of mothers' requests for
sole custody. In all these cases (which include situations
where one parent requested joint and the other demanded
sole), the court mandated joint custody.
   In California, where most divorce cases are settled with
mediators out of court, the Stanford study similarly found
that 30% of the mothers and 38% of the fathers who requested
sole custody were denied it. Even when both parents agreed on
who should have sole custody, mediators pushed them into
joint custody in 5% of the cases, the study found.
   "Lawyers aren't trained to sit down with parents and
evaluate what will be best for a child they've never seen,"
says Ms. Wallerstein. "They're more likely to discuss
economic and legal issues, and they will make recommendations
to their clients based on what the court might favor" --
which often means joint custody.
   Some states, including Minnesota and Missouri, have
recently passed laws advocating joint custody. But several
states with joint-custody experience are moving the other
way. Massachusetts, Utah and California, a leader in the
joint-custody movement in the early 1980s, recently revoked
statutes favoring joint custody. Courts in Florida and South
Carolina decided in 1989 that joint custody should only be
considered under exceptional circumstances because it doesn't
provide a stable home environment.
   Even when both parents request joint custody, it can cause
big problems. "My daughter can't eat, sleep or get her work
done when she has to switch homes," says Anita Brazer, a
40-year-old homemaker from Lake Forest, Ill., "because she's
so worried about whether everything will be packed, whether
she'll remember to bring the English paper she's working on,
whether she'll have the right supplies for her art project."
   Joint decision making has proved difficult for the
parents. Says Ms. Brazer: "We fight about every little
nitpicky thing, from whether Chad should go to school for a
full day or a half day to whether Erika should be allowed to
chew gum."
   The father, Skip Brazer, agrees that the current
arrangement, in which the two children spend four-day
weekends with him every other week plus dinner once or twice
a week, is tough on them: "It's hello, goodbye, hello,
goodbye all the time," he says. A 42-year-old salesman in
Libertyville, Ill., he has proposed that the children spend
alternate weeks with each parent. "With longer blocks of
time, they wouldn't bounce around so much," he says.
   Ms. Brazer, however, wants to spend more time with her
children, not less. The couple will go to mediation next
month in an attempt to modify the custody arrangement for the
third time in two years.
   Some joint-custody arrangements survive, but with much
stress and strain. Carl Belcher, a 43-year-old engineer from
Columbia, Md., found joint custody worked best when he and
his former wife ignored "nitty-gritty details" outlined in
legal documents about such things as the exact times each
parent would pick up the children and who would pay for
clothing. "Instead, we worked hard to make sure the kids
wouldn't suffer," he says.
   Mr. Belcher's joint-custody pact has survived 10 years,
largely because he and his ex-wife have remained flexible
about visitation. His daughter, now 18, has had trouble
adjusting to the joint parenting and attends counseling at
the Children of Separation and Divorce Center in Columbia.
But overall, he says, the arrangement has worked: "I would
not have left the marriage under any other circumstances."

BATTLE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But six months later, Robert Moschetta left his wife of nine years and took
the baby, fathered with his sperm, with him.;    Now all three "parents" --
husband, wife and surrogate -- are battling for custody.;    Legal scholars
say the case, Moschetta vs. Moschetta and Jordan, could set a precedent in
California with broad implications, not just for future surrogate parent
contracts but for gay parents, stepparents and others who rear children in
non-traditional families.;    Like the nationally publicized lawsuit by
surrogate Anna M. Johnson, also of Orange County, who is appealing a court
decision not to let her keep the child she bore, the latest case raises thorny
questions about the definition of parenthood.;    Winner will face the father;
 When the trial begins March 25, Orange County Superior Court Judge Nancy
Wieben Stock will first have to decide which woman is 9-month-old Marissa
Moschetta's legal mother.;    Is it Jordan, the baby's genetic and natural
mother?;    Or is it Cynthia Moschetta? She has no biological link to the
child, but she planned for the birth, helped pay the surrogate, took a
maternity leave to care for Marissa and considers the baby her own.;    In yet
another unsettling legal twist, the woman who wins the motherhood contest will
then face off in court against Robert Moschetta, the biological father, who
wants to raise his daughter alone.;    In the so-called "Baby M" case, the New
Jersey Supreme Court gave the biological father, William Stern, and the
surrogate mother, Mary Beth Whitehead, parental rights. Stern's wife, Betsy,
who helped raise the child, was given no legal rights.;    But Cynthia
Moschetta believes women in her position should not be shut out by the
courts.;    "I don't think it's fair for someone to have to fight like this,"
she said. "I believe she's my baby.";    At the moment, Robert Moschetta has
temporary custody of Marissa, and Cynthia Moschetta has visitation two days a
week.;    Denied contact with child;  Jordan, who calls the baby Melissa
Jordan, said the Moschettas have allowed her to see the baby only once. So
far, the court has denied her any contact with the child.;    Friends say
Jordan, 42, a divorced mother of three other children, believes it is the
couple who have breached their promise to provide the baby with a loving,
two-parent home.;    "To me, the fault lies entirely with the couple and not
the surrogate," said Nina F. Kellogg, a Los Angeles psychologist who has
arranged more than 30 surrogate pregnancies, including this one.;    Attorneys
for the three say the Moschetta case is the first of its kind to come before a
court in California and perhaps in the nation. But they disagree about which
laws should apply -- contract law or family law on adoption, divorce and
custody.;    "We're on the new frontier," said Leslee J. Newman, the attorney
for Cynthia Moschetta.;    Cynthia, 51, has a 30-year-old son by a previous
marriage. Shortly before she met Robert, 35, she had her ovarian tubes tied.; 
  The couple considered adoption but settled on a surrogate mother, she said,
partly because they thought it would be faster and partly because her husband
"wanted it to be blood.";    No mention of divorce; The contract specified
that Jordan would be paid $10,000 and made no mention of what would happen to
the child in a divorce. A clause barring a couple from divorcing would be
unenforceable, said Catherine M. Adams, who drafted the contract on behalf of
the Moschettas.;    In November 1989, Jordan conceived through artificial
insemination. Five months later, Robert Moschetta told his wife he wanted to
divorce her and raise the baby himself.;    After consultations with Kellogg,
they agreed not to tell the surrogate, Cynthia Moschetta said.;    As soon as
Marissa was born May 28, 1990, Jordan announced that she would not allow the
child to go home with the Moschettas.;    "Her stand was, 'I wanted the baby
to go into a stable home with two parents who love the baby,' " Adams said.;  
 But after intense negotiations, Jordan agreed to let the Moschettas take the
baby home.;    However, according to Adams and others, Jordan imposed several
conditions: that the Moschettas agree to undergo marriage counseling for at
least one year; that Jordan would not finalize a formal adoption during that
period; and that Jordan would still be paid. Jordan also wanted to be allowed
to visit the baby to make sure all was well, Kellogg said.;    The Moschettas
agreed, Cynthia said.;    On Nov. 30, Robert told Cynthia he was moving out of
their home and taking the baby with him, saying it would be better for Marissa
to be raised by him than to be shuttled between two homes.;    In legal
documents, his attorney argued that Cynthia is "no more than a stepmother" and
should not have parental rights.;    "I bathe her; I feed her; I change her; I
give her bottles," Robert said. "Once this situation is behind me and I get
things taken care of, I think I will have a wife and family and hopefully
another baby."  </TEXT>

say the case, Moschetta vs. Moschetta and Jordan, could set a precedent in
California with broad implications, not just for future surrogate parent
contracts but for gay parents, stepparents and others who rear children in
non-traditional families.;    Like the nationally publicized lawsuit by
surrogate Anna M. Johnson, also of Orange County, who is appealing a court
decision not to let her keep the child she bore, the latest case raises thorny
questions about the definition of parenthood.;    When the trial begins March
25, Orange County Superior Court Judge Nancy Wieben Stock will first have to
decide which woman is 9-month-old Marissa Moschetta's legal mother.;    Is it
Jordan, the baby's genetic and natural mother?;    Or is it Cynthia Moschetta?
She has no biological link to the child, but she planned for the birth, helped
pay the surrogate, took a maternity leave to care for Marissa and considers
the baby her own.;    In yet another unsettling legal twist, the woman who
wins the motherhood contest will then face off in court against Robert
Moschetta, the biological father, who wants to raise his daughter alone.;   
In the so-called "Baby M" case, the New Jersey Supreme Court gave the
biological father, William Stern, and the surrogate mother, Mary Beth
Whitehead, parental rights. Stern's wife, Betsy, who helped raise the child,
was given no legal rights.;    But Cynthia Moschetta believes women in her
position should not be shut out by the courts.;    "I don't think it's fair
for someone to have to fight like this," she said. "I believe she's my baby.";
   At the moment, Robert Moschetta has temporary custody of Marissa, and
Cynthia Moschetta has visitation two days a week.;    Jordan, who calls the
baby Melissa Jordan, said the Moschettas have allowed her to see the baby only
once. So far, the court also has denied her any contact with the child.;   
Friends say Jordan, 42, a divorced mother of three other children, believes it
is the couple who have breached their promise to provide the baby with a
loving, two-parent home.;    "To me, the fault lies entirely with the couple
and not the surrogate," said Nina F. Kellogg, a Los Angeles psychologist who
has arranged more than 30 surrogate pregnancies, including this one.;   
Attorneys for the three say that the Moschetta case is the first of its kind
to come before a court in California and perhaps in the nation. But they
disagree about which laws should apply -- contract law or family law on
adoption divorce and custody.;    "We're on the new frontier," said Leslee J.
Newman, the attorney for Cynthia Moschetta.;    Cynthia, 51, has a 30-year-old
son by a previous marriage. Shortly before she met Robert, 35, she had her
ovarian tubes tied.;    The couple considered adoption but settled on a
surrogate mother, she said, partly because they thought it would be faster and
partly because her husband "wanted it to be blood.";    The contract specified
that Jordan would be paid $10,000 and made no mention of what would happen to
the child in a divorce. A clause barring a couple from divorcing would be
unenforceable, said Catherine M. Adams, who drafted the contract on behalf of
the Moschettas.;    In November 1989 Jordan conceived through artificial
insemination. Five months later, Robert Moschetta told his wife he wanted to
divorce her and raise the baby himself.;    After consultations with Kellogg,
they agreed not to tell the surrogate, Cynthia Moschetta said.;    As soon as
Marissa was born May 28, 1990, Jordan announced that she would not allow the
child to go home with the Moschettas.;    "Her stand was, 'I wanted the baby
to go into a stable home with two parents who love the baby,' " Adams said.;  
 But after intense negotiations, Jordan agreed to let the Moschettas take the
baby home.;    However, according to Adams and others, Jordan imposed several
conditions: that the Moschettas agree to undergo marriage counseling for at
least one year; that Jordan would not finalize a formal adoption during that
period; and that Jordan would still be paid. Jordan also wanted to be allowed
to visit the baby to make sure all was well, Kellogg said.;    The Moschettas
agreed, Cynthia said.;    Nov. 30, Robert told Cynthia he was moving out of
their home and taking the baby with him, saying it would be better for Marissa
to be raised by him than to be shuttled between two homes.  </TEXT>

HOW THEY KILLED THE LITTLE GIRL IN HER; 
</P>
<P>
LION AT THE DOOR BY DAVID ATTOE (LITTLE, BROWN: $17.95; 232 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Margot Mifflin, Mifflin is a contributing editor at Elle magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though "mature" writers from John Updike to Saul Bellow recently have been 
chided for their two-dimensional depictions of women in fiction, David Attoe's 
explosive first novel, "Lion at the Door," proves that you don't have to be a 
woman to penetrate the female psyche. Attoe wiggles into the mind of Hazel 
Sapper, a girl growing up in industrial England in the 1950s, to reveal the 
ruin of her youth -- and life -- by her sexually abusive father. Through the 
voices of Hazel, her daughter and her childhood friend Rosko, Attoe convinces 
us that time doesn't heal all wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Hazel describes her bleak family life in the poetically coarse, abbreviated 
dialect of the English Midlands, where her father is a coal miner. Her tender 
but defeated mother is impotent in the face of her husband's violence. The 
girl's only sanctuary is in books, which her father considers evil, and in 
Rosko, who takes her to the hut in the woods he built as an escape from his own 
domestic hell. Attoe communicates all the girlish charm of Hazel's fervid mind 
while he teases out the brutal realities -- rape, "hidings," the girl's 
thwarted literary ambitions -- that will eventually jaundice it. She indulges 
in loving descriptions of the countryside and has a special fondness for birds 
and plant life, her only reference to a free and unpolluted world: 
</P>
<P>
"And then the gray wagtail, that had scurried up the shallows along the stream, 
said tzissi tzissi, and dipped its head and neck forward with every movement, 
as if it was agreeing with itself, as it flickered over the watery stones." 
</P>
<P>
After Hazel and Rosko are beaten by their parents for falling asleep in the 
hideaway overnight, the boy runs away, and Hazel's remaining school years are 
tinged with loneliness. She waits longingly for his return, then gives up: "I 
realized there was nothing left to wait for and I knew I'd have to be like them 
now with today and tomorrow separate, bossing me . . . I didn't want to hate, 
but I did." 
</P>
<P>
The narrative then passes to Hazel's estranged daughter, who's come home for 
her mother's funeral 25 years later. Daughter (also named Hazel) feels nothing 
for the impassive woman who, she learns from a family friend, bore two children 
by a violent, alcoholic husband after a shotgun wedding, then was abandoned. In 
short, Hazel's capacity for love was suffocated by the brutal men in her life 
and the economic trap they forced her into. Her children -- the products of her 
degradation and defeat -- never knew the playfully intrepid person who once 
inhabited her chilly shell. 
</P>
<P>
When Rosko assumes the narrative voice in the book's final chapter, he's a 
reminder of what could have been, just as daughter Hazel is evidence of what 
was. We don't know half enough about his life or the daughter's, but we learn 
that he returned to Hazel a year before her death to reclaim her friendship, 
only to find her broken and vengeful: "I didn't want what was his inside me," 
she reflects on her first pregnancy. "Once it was in you, leeching for a life 
you didn't have to give, what did it matter what color eyes or hair it would 
have . . . He wanted no different from what my soddin' father did . . . Took it 
the same way. Rough." 
</P>
<P>
This is a relentlessly dark novel, and the question arises: Could a woman bear 
children without ever loving them? Considering the increasing number of mothers 
who drop their infants out of windows or stuff them in garbage cans, however, 
Hazel's plight is not unrealistic. Attoe avoids letting his tale sink into a 
maelstrom of misery by animating his three narrators with rage and imbuing them 
with a vivid, Faulkneresque sense of the local landscape and dialect. He grants 
the reader the final satisfaction of the reunion, at which Rosko is able to 
coax forth a glimmer of the girl he once knew. He later vows to take her some 
garden plants to persuade her to see him again, but what happens between them 
in the months before her death is left to the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
While many first novels are dashed off with cheap cynicism and smug urbanity, 
"Lion at the Door" is a gold mine of complexity, both psychological and 
structural. Attoe has a muscular prose style in which nouns often double as 
verbs, and he's able to shift narrative voices -- male and female -- with 
idiosyncratic realism. Perfectly tuned, exquisitely told, "Lion at the Door" is 
thorny beauty.

   Fathers can help boys achieve higher educational
development by providing social and emotional support in childhood,
but for daughters the key age for offering support is adolescence,
a new study suggests.
   ``Shooting a basketball on the court in the evening with your
(adolescent) daughter has a positive effect ... on how far she'll
go in education,'' said researcher John Snarey.
   But sons will benefit more from such activities as taking them
trick-or-treating, supporting their joining the Boy Scouts and
spending time with them before bedtime, all while the child is
between ages 1 and 10, the study suggests.
   The work was presented Friday at the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association. Snarey, a psychology professor
at Emory University in Atlanta, collaborated with Anthony Maier at
Northwestern University.
   They looked at data on childrearing practices collected from 248
working-class, white men in Boston in a study that began some 40
years ago. Then they compared that to the educational levels the
fathers' first-born children went on to achieve by age 25 or older.
About half the children were daughters.
   Similar results have been reported before from studies done
without such long-term followup, Snarey said.
   Specifically, the researchers looked at how far above the
parents' education level the children eventually rose.
   For girls, that difference was accentuated when fathers had
supported their physical development between ages 11 and 19,
through such activities as teaching them sports, giving sex
education, and taking them to the dentist.
   One possible explanation is that boys probably get help with
physical development from other people such as coaches if the
father doesn't provide it, while girls often don't have alternative
sources, Snarey said.
   Helpful activities for boys during childhood stressed
social-emotional development, such as rocking the infant to sleep
and calming the boy's fears of darkness.
   Activities to foster intellectual development did not appear to
help boys or girls, the study found.
   Researchers also looked at the eventual occupational levels of
the children, and found higher levels among females whose fathers
had provided more social-emotional development during adolescence.
That included such activities as taking them to church, spending
time with them on weekends and providing guidance on dating
problems.
   No fathering activities were found to help the boys'
occupational levels.
   The various analyses in the study took into account the
education levels of the father and mother, marital problems,
alcohol abuse, number of children, the father's IQ and his ways of
coping with stress.
   Researchers cautioned that the fathers typically began their
families during the 1950s and that other forces not addressed in
the study are no doubt acting on fathers who started families since
then.
   In addition, the sample included only white, urban,
working-class fathers, so results may not apply in other
populations, reseachers said.

<LEADPARA>  FOR Will Dixon-Gray, being a parent means waking his 14-year-old son several
times each morning before the boy finally rousts himself from bed. It means
nagging him about wearing the rubber bands on his braces and reminding him to
walk the dogs and not to just put them in the yard. It means nursing him
through colds, reviewing his homework and watching "The Simpsons" on
television with him on Thursday nights.;    But life in the Dixon-Gray
household is not as traditional as it seems. Dixon-Gray was reminded of that
recently when some junior high school students who had been taunting his son
took to pelting the house with rocks and beer cans. They had heard Dixon-Gray
was gay and wanted to make something of it.  </LEADPARA>

HOMOSEXUALS ADDRESS THEIR KIDS' MATURITY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The boy shrugged off the incident by saying he does not let such things
bother him, but his uneasiness, his yearning to hide, were obvious in other
ways, including a request that his first name not be used and his face not be
shown in a photograph.;    "I only tell certain people," the boy said,
punctuating an account of life in a gay household with long adolescent pauses.
"I didn't tell those guys, but maybe somebody else did. Mostly it's OK. It's
not like, 'Oh, I wish I had a gay father, too.' It's more like, 'Oh, so what.'
";    Dixon-Gray and his son are living at the frontier of gay life. There
have always been homosexuals who became mothers or fathers in conventional
marriages and then reared their children after divorce. But now, more and
more, gay men and lesbians are doing it the other way around -- first
declaring themselves homosexuals and then setting out to form families.;   
THE OLDEST of this new wave of children is just a few years from early
adolescence, the years when conformity is most important and when they will
probably face the harshest barbs from their peers. This is a time that the gay
and lesbian mothers and fathers are now dreading.;    "I prepare myself for
him just hating me for a period of time," said Margie Andreco, the lesbian
mother of a 2-year-old son. They live with Andreco's partner, Amy Farrell, in
Three Rivers, near Visalia in northeast Tulare County.;    In some cases, like
Dixon-Gray's, the children are adopted, which is growing easier for
homosexuals, particularly in cities with many hard-to-place youngsters. In
other cases, like Andreco's, children are born to lesbian mothers through
artificial insemination, often with a biological father who takes part in
family life much as a divorced father would. Rarer are the children born to
surrogate mothers and raised by gay fathers.;    There is no official tally of
the number of gay and lesbian parents and their children, but there are many
indicators that their numbers are growing.;    Around the country, there are
35 chapters of a gay parents' organization that was formed a dozen years ago
for divorced gay fathers and since then has expanded its mandate to include
other categories. Several cities, including Dallas and San Diego, have
counseling groups for the teen-age children of gay parents.;    In San
Francisco, a synagogue in the gay community, Temple Sha'ar Zahav, recently
organized a Hebrew school for the children of its members. In New York City, a
recreational group for the children of gay parents, Center Kids, now has 200
members.;    Although there is much debate over exactly what determines a
person's sexual preference, 35 studies conducted in the past 15 years have
shown that the children of gay and lesbian parents are no more likely to
become homosexuals and are just as well-adjusted as other children.;    In
most states, homosexuality no longer disqualifies a parent from custody,
although judges retain enormous discretion. And only two states, Florida and
New Hampshire, explicitly prohibit homosexuals from adopting.;    "If the
parents really love a child and think about the child's issues rather than
their own, there is no reason to shy away from it," said T. Berry Brazelton, a
professor of pediatrics at Harvard University, who to this generation of
parents and children is what Dr. Benjamin Spock was to the last.;    WHILE the
studies point to no particular emotional problems for these children,
psychologists and psychiatrists agree that they suffer the insults of their
peers in early adolescence and that some could benefit from therapy during
this period.;    The experts also note that parents who are intensely
political about their sexuality may make it harder for their children by
denying them the option of secrecy. But the experts say the stigma may be
offset when the children are wanted -- born or adopted after great
deliberation.;    In interviews around the nation with two dozen gay parents
and some of their children, it was clear that the diciest time for the
youngsters was the ages of 12 to 14.;    "That's the same time that kids don't
want zits or a parent who is obese," said Wayne Steinman, a founder of Center
Kids and the adoptive parent of a 3-year-old daughter.;    Until junior high
school, parents and children agree, there is virtually no stigma, although
small children will sometimes ask why one parent is missing.;    "Once in a
while she fantasizes she had a dad and he died," said Michelle Hall, a
kindergarten teacher in Downey who is raising a 5-year-old daughter with her
lesbian partner. "Then the next second, it's, 'What's for dinner?' ";   
Sometimes a child's need for secrecy collides with a parent's desire to be
open about sexuality, often a political principle in the gay community.;   
Gabrielle Lowe, a 22-year-old whose mother is a lesbian, recalled cringing
when she was picked up at school by a masculine-looking woman.;    "People
would say, 'Is that a guy?' " Lowe said. "I'd say it was my mom's friend. But
I felt a sense of 'Why do my friends have to deal with these dykey women?' "; 
  Some parents argue that total openness is the right route because it
instills pride and pluck in a child. But others disagree and keep the
political symbols of the gay world out of their children's lives as much as
possible.;    "The kids can make their own decision when they're 18 whether
they want to be seen on TV wearing pink triangles and carrying posters," said
one Michigan lesbian, a social worker and the mother of three adopted children.  </TEXT>

JOHNSON-CALVERT CUSTODY HEARING GETS UNDER WAY.

<P>
The most important hearing in the landmark custody battle over a baby born to 
surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson opened Tuesday, featuring testimony that any 
woman who gives birth to a child has the right to call herself the parent even 
if the child is not genetically related to her. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michelle Harrison, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh and a 
consultant to the National Coalition Against Surrogacy, said that birth mothers 
are the biological mothers of the children they bear, even if another couple 
provided the egg and sperm that made the baby, as Mark and Crispina Calvert, an 
infertile couple, did in Johnson's case. 
</P>
<P>
"She is the mother of the baby because she gestated and gave birth to that 
child," said Harrison, who has studied the psychological impact of new 
reproductive technology on mothers and their children. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes her a mother is her emotional and physical work in nurturing the 
fetus and the way in which her body builds the baby. It brings oxygen. It takes 
away waste. It protects the baby from bacteria and external assault." 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the baby and the Calverts attacked the testimony of Johnson's 
witnesses, claiming that they were illogical and unqualified to act as experts 
on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, who has counseled Johnson by telephone, was called as a witness by 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's lawyers in what is expected to be a three-day hearing. Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. is confronted with an unprecedented 
decision: does the baby have two parents -- the Calverts -- or three, including 
Johnson? A three-parent ruling could redefine prevailing legal definitions of 
parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 29, who agreed to bear the Calverts' child for $10,000, hopes to 
establish that she should be considered the legal mother of the 3-week-old baby 
boy because she carried and delivered him. The Calverts, who have temporary 
custody of the child, believe that they are the baby's only true parents 
because they provided the genetic material from which he sprang. 
</P>
<P>
Blood and DNA tests have proved that the Calverts are the genetic parents of 
the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's second witness, San Diego clinical psychologist David B. Chamberlain, 
agreed with Harrison that a birth mother plays a greater role in giving life to 
a child than does a genetic mother. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain, author of a book called "Babies Remember Birth," said an infant's 
bond to its birth mother also justifies assigning her parental rights. He cited 
studies of infant-mother bonding indicating that newborns who have never seen 
their birth mothers before can recognize their pictures and identify them by 
odor and touch in a darkened room. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Tuesday's hearing turned into an uneasy exploration into the 
frontiers of morality, law, philosophy and biology. One such moment came as 
Harold LaFlamme, the baby's court-appointed lawyer, questioned Harrison about 
the logic she used to conclude that Johnson is the child's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, who had just testified that Crispina Calvert's genetic contribution 
to the baby is less important than Johnson's gestational role, told LaFlamme 
that she considers Mark Calvert the child's father. Why, LaFlamme demanded, is 
it acceptable to define a father by his genetic contribution but not a mother? 
</P>
<P>
"Technology has created a new dilemma for us," Harrison said. "The old 
definition of father still works, but we're confronted with having to look 
again at our definition of mother." 
</P>
<P>
Smiling, she added: "I'm not comfortable with any of this." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison stuck by her belief that a birth mother contributes more to the making 
of a child than do the sperm and egg donors. 
</P>
<P>
"Anna is the mother and the Calverts are the other half, like the father," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She added later that the child essentially has three parents and that she 
believes that Johnson is the baby's true mother. She said Johnson has expressed 
deep feelings of attachment to the baby. 
</P>
<P>
The Calverts' lawyer, Christian R. Van Deusen, asked whether Harrison had 
questioned Johnson to determine whether she was telling the truth about her 
feelings of bonding to the child. Harrison said she wanted to be "supportive" 
and not "interrogate" Johnson, so she had not. Van Deusen asked whether 
Harrison's opinion was affected by a July 23 letter that Johnson wrote to the 
Calverts, threatening to keep the child unless she was immediately paid the 
remainder of her $10,000 fee. Harrison said that did not matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Pregnant women faced with the loss of their baby say and do a lot of things to 
keep them," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deusen also tried to question the reliability of Johnson's claims by 
bringing up her guilty plea to two counts of welfare fraud, but Parslow barred 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to try that case in here, Mr. Van Deusen," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union entered the case Tuesday, filing a 
friend-of-the-court brief that argued all three adults have parental rights 
over the baby.

<P>
In an extremely unusual case that could not have been prosecuted in California, 
the father of a 38-year-old Sunland woman has been convicted in Wyoming of 
raping his daughter and niece more than 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by psychological counseling, Lorretta Woodbury contacted Wyoming 
authorities in January and asked them to prosecute her father, Lloyd Calvin 
Woodbury, for sexually molesting her and a cousin in the late 1950s and early 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Woodbury's efforts, her father was charged in August with five 
felony sexual abuse counts in connection with assaults on Woodbury, his niece 
and a third girl, also a niece, whose alleged molestation came to light after 
Wyoming authorities began an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming authorities believe that the case is one of the oldest non-murder cases 
in that state and probably in the nation. Filing the case was possible because 
Wyoming, unlike most other states, has no statute of limitations on criminal 
cases, officials said. In California, the statute of limitations ranges from 
two to six years for all crimes except murder, which has no time limit, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Now 73 and living in Ingram, Tex., Lloyd Woodbury pleaded guilty Nov. 28 in 
Carbon County to having raped his daughter, then 10, in the summer of 1962 and 
his niece, then 13, in the summer of 1958. 
</P>
<P>
The assaults occurred in Rawlins, a city of 8,000 in south-central Wyoming, 
where the family lived at the time, said Lorretta Woodbury, a free-lance 
commercial artist who moved to the San Fernando Valley two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea bargain, prosecutors dropped additional accusations that 
Woodbury took "indecent liberties" with another 8-year-old niece in 1958 and 
with his daughter in 1959 and that he raped his daughter in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming 2nd Judicial District Judge Larry Lehman sentenced Woodbury, a retired 
taxidermist and bronze sculptor, to five years probation and ordered him to 
undergo counseling and to avoid contact with the victims. He must avoid being 
around children unless another adult is present, said Carbon County Prosecuting 
Atty. Kurt Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Lorretta Woodbury said psychological counseling she received at the Valley 
Trauma Center at Cal State Northridge made her decide to try to have her father 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed for five minutes that they would do anything with it," she 
said in a telephone interview. "Basically what I was doing was venting. Instead 
of keeping all this stuff to myself and letting myself be a victim, I was 
starting to say I am not going to keep quiet anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly at first told Lorretta Woodbury that it would be practically impossible 
to find enough evidence to prosecute so old a case. Undeterred, she provided 
more details, persuading Kelly to turn the case over to the Carbon County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Although decades had passed, investigators emerged with what Kelly considered 
strong evidence: All three women, independently, told similar stories, 
corroborating each other. Further corroboration came from relatives and other 
witnesses who confirmed that the assaults had been reported to them decades 
ago, the prosecutor added. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Woodbury, interviewed by phone in Texas, said he waived extradition and 
pleaded guilty to the charges "to keep from going to court." He denied raping 
his daughter or nieces. 
</P>
<P>
"I had relations with one of the friends but there was no rape to it. Just 
sexual relations," Lloyd Woodbury said. "She'd been married. It was just one of 
those things, you know." 
</P>
<P>
He accused his daughter of making the allegations in retaliation for his 
accusations against her of committing grand theft seven years ago while living 
in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter denied her father's allegations and said she pleaded no contest to 
embezzlement charges only to avoid going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Casper, Wyo., to parents who soon divorced, Lorretta Woodbury lived 
with her mother and on a welfare ranch before being sent to live with her 
father and stepmother at age 7. 
</P>
<P>
According to Woodbury, the abuse started almost immediately. She said her 
father molested her in his taxidermy shop and ordered her not to talk about 
what he said was "something special between fathers and daughters." 
</P>
<P>
The abuse escalated to mutual oral sex and, on her 10th birthday, to 
intercourse, said Woodbury, who remembers her father assaulting her in his 
truck outside town and then taking her home to eat birthday cake. 
</P>
<P>
Her father threatened to send her to reform school if she told anyone and told 
her that he had friends at the post office who would intercept any letters she 
tried to write seeking help, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"At that age, you believe that stuff," said Woodbury, who only later learned 
that her father was also molesting a cousin. "I didn't feel good about it but I 
didn't feel there was much I could do about it. I felt it was all my fault and 
I deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
"He bought me just about anything I wanted. I had motorcycles and horses. I was 
in 4-H, junior choir, went to church and taught vacation Bible School." But she 
recalls having severe problems in school. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when they had the first class on sex education, I felt like 
crawling under the table at school because my dad and I had been doing that," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The molestation continued, about three times a week in her father's shop, the 
barn, the truck -- even in the house at night, with her stepmother asleep in 
another room, Woodbury recalled. Altogether, the abuse continued for seven 
years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The molestation ended after Lorretta Woodbury's stepsister came to visit. 
Woodbury wrote a note to her mother detailing the sexual abuse and sewed it 
into her sister's coat, she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers removed the girl, then 14, from home a few weeks later but her 
father was never prosecuted. Authorities said law enforcement officials were 
reluctant to prosecute such cases in past years. 
</P>
<P>
Lorretta Woodbury spent nearly two years in a state mental hospital and held a 
series of jobs before moving to Texas at 31 to be near her father and her 
ailing stepmother, whom she loved. There, she said, she began confronting her 
father about the past abuse. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving probation on the embezzlement conviction, she came West again, 
settling two years ago in the Valley. She began attending Metropolitan 
Community Church. Urged by church officials to seek help in dealing with the 
incest in her background, she sought counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel relieved, peaceful," she said about reporting the abuse, adding that 
she hopes that her example will "help other incest victims. Our lives are worth 
something."

PSYCHICS AID HUNT FOR ALZHEIMER VICTIM

Benjamin Jackson Lee Franklin's daughters have distributed 1,500 flyers, 
organized neighborhood search parties and even consulted two psychics. But one 
month after he walked away from his Chatsworth home, the 81-year-old war hero 
is still missing. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, who was awarded a Bronze Star in World War II and now suffers from 
Alzheimer's disease, left his house in the 9900 block of Rudnick Avenue on Aug. 
2. He was seen at an ice cream store at Mason Avenue and Devonshire Street in 
Chatsworth and later sitting on a nearby bus bench. 
</P>
<P>
But his daughter, Patricia Gillies of Tujunga, said she doubts that any bus 
picked her father up. "In his condition, he'd never attempt to get on an RTD," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Franklin has lost the ability to speak clearly, dial a 
telephone or remember an address. "All he does is chuckle and laugh or break 
down and cry," Gillies said. "He's become very emotional." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Ill 
</P>
<P>
Gillies and Franklin's other daughters -- Marlene Coast and Barbara Russell, 
both of Granada Hills -- said the strain of worrying about their missing father 
has made their mother, Vivian, 77, ill. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters said they have done everything they can. Search parties have been 
organized and flyers have been distributed from the San Francisco Bay Area to 
the Mexican border. They have called the Los Angeles Police Department's 
missing persons section so often that they have been asked to limit their 
inquiries to one a day. 
</P>
<P>
Then they went to the psychics. The first one said she couldn't communicate 
with Franklin because "his mind was too confused," Gillies said. The second 
psychic, Sonia, said Franklin "was traveling up the coast in a truck with 
another man," according to Russell. The sisters will visit Sonia at her Beverly 
Hills salon again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There has been one unconfirmed sighting. On Aug. 17, a McDonald's employee in 
Castaic called the Sheriff's Department and said a man who looked like Franklin 
had just bought a hamburger. Deputies arrived after the man had left, Gillies 
said, but were unable to locate him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shopping Cart 
</P>
<P>
Coast received a call a week later about a man who looked like her father who 
was pushing a shopping cart in Chatsworth. The man was there when she arrived, 
but it wasn't her father. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew my father wouldn't be pushing a shopping cart, but I couldn't be sure," 
Coast said. "I hate to think that my father would look like a street person, 
but he's been away for so long, that's how he'd look unless somebody is taking 
care of him." 
</P>
<P>
Police officers investigating Franklin's disappearance were unavailable for 
comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Russell's frustration is turning into anger. She said she believes that her 
father has been abandoned. Franklin, a 27-year Navy veteran, was awarded the 
Bronze Star for carrying wounded soldiers to safety while under artillery fire 
during the Normandy invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"We've exhausted every channel," Gillies said. "Our only hope is the public. 
Maybe somebody will see his picture and tell us where he is."

FT  01 MAY 91 / Jobs: Stress at work - a question of upbringing:
Vulnerability in face of pressure is often linked with experiences during
childhood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHAT'S a challenge to one person may be stress to a second, and a third's
breaking point.' Besides being perennially one of the truer maxims about
working life, that saying can rarely if ever have been of more urgent
relevance to so many people.
Recession added to sharpening trade rivalry create conditions suited only to
supreme optimists, who characteristically see every setback as short-term,
one-off and above all the fault of someone or something other than
themselves. Challenges to them tend to be anxieties to those of us who are
less sure of our own perfection, regarding failures as symptoms of personal
deficiency.
Nevertheless even habitually self-critical people's tendency to be stressed
by things others take nonchalantly is often not their own fault. I say that
on the evidence of research by the Leeds University psychologist Jenny
Firth-Cozens which, although focused mainly on junior hospital doctors, has
produced findings her other work suggests apply to executives too.
Her studies show that proneness to stress is linked with conditions of
upbringing. So it seems probable that by recognising such links, people
suffering from the liability can make themselves more robust.
For instance, readers who feel stress-prone may care to consider their
father's age at their birth. The research revealed an impressive contrast in
robustness between those respectively born to fathers under and over
approximately 35.
Among the junior doctors, all aged 22-23, those who never felt stressed had
fathers whose average age at the time of the study was 52. That compared
with 59 for the dads of the doctors who were 'cased' - the technical term
for people who, although still physically well, are distractingly worried.
Another factor apparently strongly linked with vulnerability was the
mother's death before the child was 15. On the other hand, divorce had only
a weak link and death of the father showed no association at all.
But in the particular case of executives, the Leeds psychologist believes
the main contributor to vulnerability is paternal rather than maternal
influence. Among managers she has studied, it was those with powerful and
critical fathers who most saw their bosses at work as sources of anxiety.
The explanation may be that, as Freud conjectured, they project their
father's stressful personality onto their chiefs, interpreting them as ogres
although they may in fact be considerate souls.
Even so, Jenny Firth-Cozens is well aware that bosses can be exceedingly
stressful in their own right. Witness her finding that, regardless of
personal vulnerability, the junior doctors in teaching hospitals - where top
consultants have traditionally treated their underlings in domineering style
 -were markedly more stressed than the juniors employed elsewhere.
That, she says, is noteworthy evidence that something in the management of
teaching hospitals is wrong. To the Jobs column's mind, it is also something
even hospital chiefs short of money ought to be able to put right.
NOW to the table alongside giving a sample of the results of Day Associates'
latest quarterly survey of pay and perks in some five dozen international

2.31, 75 Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel 071-375 1397, fax 071-375 1723.
The price to concerns not taking part in the survey is Pounds 175 plus VAT.
My figures refer to a mere 15 fairly senior positions. First come base
salaries, the lower quartile representing the person a quarter way up from
the foot of a ranking of all in the same kind of work, the median the person
mid-way, and the upper quartile the one a quarter way down from the top.
Then we have the average salary, followed by the percentage of it typically
received as an additional bonus. Lastly come the percentage of the people in
each type of job who have a company car, and its average price.
HEADHUNTER Paul Chambers of the Freshman Consultancy seeks two recruits for
separate clients he may not name. So he promises to honour applicants'
requests not to be identified to the employer at this stage.
His first quarry is a head for the German sales operations of an American
financial information group. Although its Frankfurt office where the
newcomer will be based is small, it already has numerous established
customers.
The job is to take the lead in building up the German business, and
candidates should have a record of go-getting success in the financial
information market. They must also be fluent in German.
Salary indicator DM200,000-250,000. Car among other benefits.
The second post, London-based but again with a US group, is for a seller of
software for capital markets uses. Computer knowledge is not needed, but
candidates must have detailed understanding of capital markets trading
especially in off-balance-sheet instruments.
Salary plus bonus on results about Pounds 50,000. Perks include car.

   Children whose parents are going through a divorce
are learning to cope through a program that includes puppets, a
board game and a mock television show that lets the kids play
divorce experts, researchers say.
   The program works for children in kindergarten through sixth
grade, using different teaching activities for different ages, said
JoAnne Pedro-Carroll.
   ``Divorce need not result in inevitable long-term trauma for
children,'' said Pedro-Carroll, director of the program at the
University of Rochester in New York.
   Studies with some 400 children of divorce show improvement in a
variety of areas, including solving day-to-day problems,
communicating with relatives, coping with family changes, getting
along with schoolmates and completing schoolwork, researchers said.
   The children said they were less anxious, less likely to blame
themselves for the divorce and less worried about family
circumstances, researchers said.
   Pedro-Carroll and colleague Linda Alpert-Gillis, both clinical
psychologists, spoke in interviews before describing the program
Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological
Association.
   The program is ``the best stuff out there'' for working directly
with children of divorce, commented Arizona State University
researcher Irwin Sandler.
   A complementary approach that involves parents who have custody
of a child is also showing success, he said.
   The Rochester program is carried out in school over 12 to 16
weeks, with four or five children to a group in kindgergarten
through third grade, and five to eight for fourth- through
sixth-graders.
   One major goal is to teach problem-solving skills. Older
children describe problems in their lives, discuss solutions and
try them out in impromptu skits in which they may play themselves,
then a parent. After trying out a solution they report back on
results.
   In this way, Pedro-Carroll said, one boy was able to persuade
his mother to let him spend Father's Day weekend with his father.
``It gave him a sense of control,'' she said.
   Children also are taught to identify and avoid focusing on
problems they cannot solve, she said.
   ``Worrying about what's happening in court between Mom and Dad,
or the support payments, those are very adult issues'' that
distract a child from schoolwork and the normal activities of being
a child, Pedro-Carroll said.
   Using a board game that involves throwing dice, moving a marker
and picking up a card that presents a problem, children discuss
what issues they can and cannot solve.
   The program also aims to teach children to identify and express
their feelings. Lacking an adult's thinking and language skills, a
child may convert unexpressed feelings into headaches or stomach
aches, Pedro-Carroll said.
   Even kindergartners can be taught to ask a parent for more time
together rather than whining or clinging, she said.
   Puppets that act out a child's feelings let younger children
more easily discuss their own experiences at home, she said.
   Older children review lessons of the program by taking turns as
divorce experts on a mock television show, in which they answer
questions posed by group leaders.
   ``You can see how that could really empower kids with a sense of
efficacy ... and competence,'' said Arizona State's Sandler.
   On an emotional level, the program is designed to help children
feel good about themselves and their families. It stresses that
``all families don't have to have two parents living together,''
said Alpert-Gillis. ``Families are people who love you, and each
family is unique and special.''
   The groups provide a place for children ``to find out they're
not alone, they're not the only ones who have the feelings they've
been struggling with,'' Pedro-Carroll said.

<LEADPARA>  WHEN Mario Montes got a job as a teacher at a Connecticut day-care center,
some parents asked quietly that he not be allowed to change their children's
diapers.;    At the time, Montes, a father of two, was pursuing an associate
degree in early-childhood education at Greater Hartford Community College in
Hartford, Conn. He honored the parents' requests, although the implications
that he might harm the child hurt.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LABELS, LOW PAY KEEP MEN FROM DAY-CARE WORK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     After six months, the parents apologized to the Vietnam veteran and former
construction crew chief.;    "They said they were wrong and they were reacting
to what they had read in the paper," said Montes, referring to cases of male
day-care employees accused of sexually abusing children.;    Montes is now a
teacher at St. Francis Child Care Center in Hartford. He is one of two men on
staff. The other is John Fortunato, who has worked at the center for 10
years.;    And while no one complains when they change diapers, the men have
to do a lot of explaining about their jobs. A man who chooses to be around
infants is immediately suspect.;    Such is the world of the man in an
early-childhood education program. Although people say children are the
future, men are not encouraged to be a part of that. Women who choose
early-childhood education as a career do so knowing they face pitiful pay and
a lack of prestige. Men, who often are still expected to be the main
breadwinner, can hardly afford the work.;    At a time when 42 million
children, or about half of America's younger population, will live with a
single parent at some point, the Census Bureau estimates that only about 4
percent of all early-childhood education workers are men.;    George Coleman,
bureau chief of curriculum and instruction in the Connecticut Department of
Education, said the main drawback to men entering child care is poor pay.;   
"Most people who work in child care, unfortunately, do so realizing there's
another salary coming from someplace else," said Coleman, a Head Start teacher
in New York in 1973. Montes and Fortunato said their wives earn more money
than they do.;    Coleman said most men come to the field from another career
and that many men who want to work with children do so in the field of child
psychology, which is somehow a more acceptable field for men.;    Startling
absence;  But given the increasing numbers of children being raised by single
mothers, the absence of men in young children's programs is startling,
child-development specialists say.;    "When kids don't have a father in their
family or some kind of consistent contact with a male relative who really
cares about them, they are unlikely to get it any other place," said Henry B.
Viller, a psychology professor at the University of Rhode Island. "I think
it's interesting that when the mother is absent, it is likely that another
woman in the family will give that child some special attention. It's not
likely to happen, though, when a child is paternally deprived.";    The
absence of men in early-childhood learning programs reflects the unfortunate
low value society places on the care of young children, Richard Sussman,
research director for the Connecticut Commission on Children, said.;    "It's
a difficult recruiting problem," he said.;    When Sussman was looking for a
preschool for his 3-year-old son, he and his wife looked for one with men on
the staff. They found one in New Haven, Conn.;    "I think he has exposure to
a lot of different women who are extremely nurturing, and I wanted him to see
other men -- besides his father -- who are nurturing," Sussman said. "I recall
from my childhood that in sixth grade, I got my first male teacher. You got
the men in sixth grade. It was a very big deal in the wrong way.";    And what
does that teach young children, many of whom so rarely see men?;    "I can
tell you which boys in our programs haven't been around men," said William
Ortiz, director of San Juan Center in Hartford. "They go through the extremes
of being macho. I've seen kids who are 13, 14, 15 get girls pregnant, and they
stick their chests out, and I say, 'Yeah, but are you supporting them?' And
they try to justify by saying, 'I gave her that baby.';    "You can see it in
the females, too. The ones who have not been around men go through extremes of
submissiveness. Where there are shared responsibilities they understand a
little more.";    Research shows that children whose fathers are involved in
their lives at an early age are more resilient at coping with change and
stress. Viller, the psychology professor, said that children who have contact
with both sexes also are often more secure in their own gender roles.;    But
the definition of male involvement varies greatly from study to study. One
study from the Journal of Marriage and the Family said 42 percent of children
from divorced families still have a "fair amount" of contact with the absent
parent. But "fair amount" was defined as contact ranging anywhere from once a
month to two or three times a month, which is hardly comparable to time spent
with the mother.;    Equal effect;  Vicky Phares, an assistant professor of
psychology at the University of Connecticut, has studied the effects of
fathers on families when the fathers are dysfunctional -- such as alcoholics
or severely depressed. She said that the effects on children when a father is
depressed are not so different from the effects on children when the mother,
who is theoretically the primary care giver, is depressed.;    "Historically,
it wasn't until 15 years ago that fathers were even investigated in terms of
normal child development," Phares said. "The thought was, 'Fathers won't
participate in research, anyway, so why should we ask them?' "  </TEXT>

   Who is a baby's mother: the woman who provides the ovum or
the woman who provides the womb?
   That's the question a Santa Ana, Calif., court is being
asked to decide in a lawsuit filed last month by a surrogate
mother. It is one of a growing number of cases that experts
say could redefine the legal meaning of parenthood.

<TEXT>
   Anna Johnson, 29 years old, is eight months pregnant with
an implanted embryo produced with sperm and eggs supplied by
Mark and Crispina Calvert. She has sued the Calverts, seeking
custody of the baby she is carrying for them. Her case raises
novel legal questions because Ms. Johnson has no genetic
connection to the unborn child.
   "In the Bible, when two women were claiming to be the
mother of the same child, King Solomon offered to divide the
child in half and give part to each. Now the courts are being
forced to consider the notion that a child can have more than
two parents," says Lori Andrews, a lawyer specializing in
reproductive law at the American Bar Foundation in Chicago.
   This quiet legal revolution has been spurred by
fundamental social and medical changes. The increase in
divorce and the number of stepfamilies has meant that many
adults perform all the functions of a parent without legal or
biological ties to a child. Rapidly evolving medical
technologies, such as the in vitro fertilization used in the
Johnson case and artificial insemination, have also raised
concerns about the legal definition of family.
   In recent years, courts around the country have created
doctrines that give stepparents and others with no genetic
connection to a child expanded legal rights. Many of these
courts are ruling that the best interests of the child may
outweigh the natural parent's constitutional rights to make
decisions about the child's upbringing.
   Some family lawyers worry that the changes will result in
too many people calling themselves parents. These lawyers
contend that expanding the legal definition of parenthood
will increase litigation over custody, visitation and other
rights.
   But other legal experts say that looking at a biological
relationship is no longer sufficient to determine who is a
parent. They say the courts must accept the reality of "how
widespread the phenomenon of complex parental relationships
is," says Nancy D. Polikoff, an associate professor at
American University Law School.
   Ms. Johnson's battle typifies the social challenges
confronting the courts. She has no genetic connection to her
unborn child, but California law says the woman who gives
birth is the mother.
   "There is no law that says anything about the parental
rights of parties that donate an embryo that was formulated
in a petri dish," says Richard Gilbert, a lawyer for Ms.
Johnson from the Santa Ana law firm Gilbert &amp; Marlowe. "Anna
is the mother of the child. She has bonded to the baby in her
womb."
   Robert Walmsley, a lawyer for the Calverts with the Santa
Ana law firm Van Deusen, Youmans &amp; Walmsley, says that
biologically the child is the Calverts'. "The court must
acknowledge and protect the biological link. There isn't
anything else at this point," he says.
   Custody suits filed by lesbian couples who reared children
together and separated are pending in appeals courts in New
York, New Mexico and California. The women are relying on
protections that used to be reserved for traditional
families.
   Michele G., a 43-year-old graduate student, wants to be
recognized as a parent of two children she reared with her
ex-lover, the biological mother. The couple split up in 1985
after 15 years together. (Court papers don't use the women's
full names.)
   As part of a verbal agreement, Michele G. retained custody
of the older child, a girl. Her former lover, Nancy S., who
conceived the children through artificial insemination, kept
custody of the younger child, a boy.
   But in 1988, Nancy S. sued for custody of both children. A
lower court in Alameda County denied Michele G. standing as a
parent and terminated her rights to visit the children. Her
case is pending before an appeals court in San Francisco.
   She contends that she acted in every way as a parent and
was listed on the children's birth certificates as their
father. "The children were born because of a joint decision,"
says Amy Oppenheimer, an Oakland, Calif., lawyer representing
Michele G. "It's not fair to the children for the court to
now say that only one of them is their mother."
   But Carol Amyx, a lawyer for Nancy S., says Michele G.'s
reasoning could be used to open the door for too many people
to become parents. "Children will potentially be placed in
the midst of multiparty custody litigation on a much more
frequent basis," says Ms. Amyx of Berkeley.
   Some courts have been willing to create legal doctrines
when they have believed continuing a significant relationship
is in a child's best interests. During divorce proceedings,
Harold J. Atkinson learned that he wasn't the biological
father of a child born during his marriage. A lower court
awarded custody of the child to his ex-wife, Terri, and
denied visitation rights to Mr. Atkinson.
   But a Michigan appeals court in Detroit in 1987 overturned
that decision, ruling that Mr. Atkinson could be considered
an "equitable parent" because he and the child acknowledged
each other as father and son and Mr. Atkinson was willing to
accept the rights and financial responsibilities of being a
parent.
   But Paul W. Harty, a Birmingham lawyer representing Mrs.
Atkinson, says it was poor law to allow a husband who isn't
the biological father to acquire rights after living with a
child for the first two years of his life. "I'm afraid that
this case will permit a vindictive husband to create problems
not only for his former wife but her child," Mr. Harty says.
   In other cases, courts have refused to grant a plaintiff
parental rights but nonetheless articulated new rules that
appear to expand the legal definition of parenthood. Last
year, the appellate division of a New Jersey state court in
Hackensack ruled that third parties who can prove they "stand
in the shoes of a parent to the child" will be treated like
natural parents by the courts. And in 1988, a New Jersey
state court in Trenton found that visitation and other
parental privileges can be extended to stepparents who can
show a significant bond with the child.
   Courts have also begun to re-examine legislation adopted
to deal with new medical technologies. More than 30 states
have enacted artificial insemination laws in which sperm
donors, with the exception of the husband, have no parental
rights.
   These laws, enacted under the assumption that the woman
wouldn't know the sperm donor, failed to take into account a
situation like Kevin McIntyre's, says his lawyer, Ronald A.
Fontana of Portland, Ore. Mr. McIntyre, a teacher, donated
sperm to a friend of 12 years, Linden Crouch. Mr. McIntyre
claims that Ms. Crouch reneged on her promise that he could
help raise the child, born in 1986.
   Last year, an Oregon appeals court in Salem ruled that the
state's 1977 artificial insemination law violated Mr.
McIntyre's constitutional rights. G. Philip Arnold, a lawyer
with Drescher &amp; Arnold of Ashland who is representing Ms.
Crouch, said the court's ruling could be extended to
anonymous donors who change their minds and then obtain the
mother's identity.
   "In the past, the courts tended to look at how much time
the father spent with the child in trying to determine
parental rights. But this court is saying that a sperm donor
may have rights if he just attempts to establish a
relationship," says reproductive law specialist Ms. Andrews.
   The case was settled this month. Mr. McIntyre was
acknowledged to have legal rights as a father, including
regular visitation, says Mr. Fontana.
   Stepparents have benefited significantly from the latest
changes. Traditionally denied parental rights, more courts
are awarding them custody. Six states have enacted statutes
that grant visitation rights to stepparents if the marriage
dissolves or the natural parent dies.
   In addition, the American Bar Association's family law
section is expected this January to consider a model act that
could be adopted by state legislatures. The proposed bill
would establish a legal relationship between stepparents and
stepchildren in the areas of child support, custody,
discipline and visitation.
   "The time has come to recognize the right of stepparents
to come into court and determine the best interests of the
child," says Joel Tenenbaum, chairman of the committee that
drafted the proposed act and a lawyer with the Wilmington,
Del., law firm Woloshin, Tenenbaum &amp; Natalie.

<HEAD>Father Seeks Visitation Rights for Daughter Given Away for Adoption</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The natural father of a girl who was adopted at
birth more than seven years ago asked the Supreme Court on Monday to
restore parental rights he contends were revoked unconstitutionally.
   Edward McNamara contends that San Diego authorities
unconstitutionally denied him the opportunity to raise the girl, who
was conceived during a brief romance with a woman that ended eight
months before the baby's birth.
   McNamara, now 42, did not learn that he had become a father until
after the infant's birth and the mother sought his consent to put
the child, named Katie, up for adoption.
   McNamara sought custody soon after he learned of Katie's birth,
but California limits the rights of an unwed father to block an
adoption.
   Attorney James E. Sutherland argued that California law
unconstitutionally discriminates against unwed fathers by making it
more difficult for them to assert rights as parents.
   ``Mr. McNamara's rights shouldn't be terminated except on the
same grounds as the mother's,'' Sutherland told the justices, noting
that a lower court that denied custody had concluded nevertheless
that his client was a loving father of two sons by a previous
marriage.
   McNamara, who is now seeking visitation rights, ``was denied any
opportunity to form any relationship with the child'' before she was
put up for adoption by the mother, who is not identified in court
records.
   But several justices expressed skepticism over McNamara's claim
that he was denied equal protection or denied his rights when
authorities allowed the natural mother to place Katie up for
adoption without McNamara's consent.
   ``None of our cases hold that a father in your client's position
has achieved a protected liberty,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist
told Sutherland.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor questioned why California didn't have
authority to adopt a policy ``that the state will consider the best
interests of the child over the alleged rights of the biological
father.''
   O'Connor asked Sutherland if McNamara could make the same claim
if the child's conception ``had been the result of a so-called
one-night stand.''
   ``If he had perfected all the rights manifesting significant
parental interest, he would be entitled'' to make the claim,
Sutherland replied.
   ``That would go significantly beyond the court's cases, where
there had been an established relationship'' between father and
child, O'Connor said.
   Lloyd Harmon Jr., counsel for San Diego County, defended
California's policy of giving an unwed mother the primary right to
decide whether to surrender a child for adoption.
   The legal distinction between unwed fathers and unwed mothers
furthers the ``state policy which is the speedy placement of
children by putting them in suitable settings so they can nurture,''
Harmon argued.
   Most unwed fathers are not easily identifiable and ``are not
necessarily interested in fatherhood,'' he said.
   ``Biology in and of itself does not not create a substantial
relationship or create a parental right,'' Harmon said. ``There must
be something substantial between the father and the child.''
   The decision to allow Robert and Pamela Moses to adopt Katie was
``not an intrusion into an existing family unit. Mr. McNamara and
his daughter were never a family. They never had any relationship.''
   ``The most they saw of each other may have been an hour and a
half some seven years ago,'' Harmon said.
   The justices are expected to decide the case by July.
   Outside the courtroom, Mrs. Moses, who attended the hearing with
her attorney, refused to comment on the case.
   McNamara said he feels a ``great loss'' by ``not being able to be
her father.''
   He said he has pursued the lengthy legal battle because ``it is
my right to raise my daughter and I am not going to give that right
up to anyone.''

Surrogate Surnames</HL>

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Staff reporter Rifka Rosenwein in an entertaining but informative article on making up new surnames for children (page one, Feb. 11) says that it is giving genealogists trouble in sorting out the family tree. 
But will it help reduce conflict for the child? 

   At one time a family was like a ship: They all sailed under one banner. 
Today, many women use their own family name and in the case of divorce and a reconstituted family, there may be found as many surnames as there are people in the household. 
The wife may be using her father's name rather than that of her first or second husband, while the children of her earlier marriage are using their natural father's surname. 

   Courts that have considered whether a mother may change the surname of minor children to that of her second husband have granted a change of name only when "the substantial welfare" of the child requires it. 
Generally, minor embarrassment or emotional upset has been held insufficient to require a change of name. 
The courts try to maintain and encourage continuing parental relationship. 
"A change of name could further weaken, if not sever, such a bond," said the Minnesota Supreme Court. 
In a Nebraska case, a psychologist testified that the children were in need of a stable home situation and identity, and it would be detrimental to their personality growth and development for them to be called by a name other than that of the second husband. 
A psychiatrist testified it would be in the best interests of the children that their legal name be made that of the second husband because the children considered they were a part of this new family, and to be called by some other name would suggest they weren't part of it. 
The court refused to grant a change of name, considering that the father was paying child support and had exercised visitation rights. 

   An innovative surname may avoid the conflict.

   I was so enchanted by your article on the new trend in surnames that I immediately phoned my friend John Pogett and his wife, nee Ann Hodgdon, that their soon-to-be-born child absolutely must be named Hodge-Podge. 
I wrote my niece, Lucinda Mix, wife of Freddy Upjohn, that it was imperative that her first child be surnamed Mixed-Up. 
And getting carried away, I insisted to my neighbor Samantha Headley, married to Joel Airman, that she must seriously consider the name Air-Head for one of their progeny. 

   I'll grant that these names don't have the sheer majesty of Roth-Tubman or the poetry of Jebef -- names cited in your story -- but I think they're beautiful just the same.

   Children whose surnames differ from those of their parents have some explaining to do, but only when people are acquainted with the names of both parent and child. 
A lot more explaining is needed, however, by those who were given first names that, in combination with their last names (and without regard to the names of their parents), cause confusion, consternation and even comic relief. 
Among those who, as helpless infants, were not consulted on the issue but who can now attest to the challenges presented by the individuality and creativity of certain parents is . . .

<LEADPARA>  IF MAKING it through adolescence in one piece has always been a gamble, the
current crop of teen-agers is being forced to play with a marked deck.;  
Starved for stability at home and scared by doom-and-gloom predictions about
the future of the planet, today's teens are struggling hard to keep a grip,
say participants at the 99th annual convention of the American Psychological
Association, which ended Tuesday.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Health &amp; Fitness; Cover Story; See also related article on page 3D of this
section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     One major point emerges from the slew of studies presented at the meeting:
Teen-agers are paying the price for the epidemic of fractured families over
the past two decades.;   "This is the first generation growing up from the
high number of broken families," says Laureen Light, who just finished a year
as a therapist at Cal State Long Beach's student counseling center. "We're
reaping theconsequences of that.";   Here's a look at some of the reports and
research from the convention.;   FEARS: Back in the good old days, when
researchers asked teens about their fears, issues like boys, girls and getting
into college topped the list. No more. Now teen-agers are more likely to worry
about whether the world will be around long enough for them to grow up.;  
Andrew Bennett and Carolyn Klein of McGill University in Montreal asked 478
suburban high-schoolers to list their worst fears. To their surprise,
globe-threatening environmental disasters topped the list. Unemployment, AIDS,
World War III and drugs and violence followed close behind.;   "These kids
really have a lot on their plate," says Klein, who points out that the teens
in their study live in a safe, clean suburb "with parks everywhere." In a
major U.S. city, teens' fears are probably even more dire, she says.;   On the
positive side, heightened awareness of world problems may help make teen-agers
"more responsible adults.";   But at what price? Excessive fear of AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases, for example, can actually stunt normal
sexual development, says Klein. "Some children are blowing it out of
proportion," she says. "They won't even eat in a restaurant because they'd
have to touch a glass.";   And, Crowe adds, "they see all these problems and
they don't see any way out of it. They see the door shut. They don't feel they
can ever succeed.;   "Some of them start using drugs. Some of them just give
up.";   DATING AND SEX: Bombarded by MTV and other sex-obsessed media almost
from the cradle, some teens are dating and having sex almost as soon as they
hit double digits. "We were really shocked," says Amy Swarr of Loyola
University in Chicago. "When I was in junior high, nobody went out with
anybody.";   But the precocious behavior can interfere with emotional
development, Swarr and her Loyola colleague Paul Crowe found. The researchers
compared fifth- through eighth-graders who go on single dates to those who
date in groups, and found that the youthful Lotharios had worse relationships
and a poorer self-image.;   "The kids who dated in groups tended to feel more
in love," says Swarr. The group daters also felt better about their bodies and
more accepted by peers.;   One-on-one dating at a too-tender age is also tied
to the rash of broken families, most likely because those kids feel that
"here's a person who can give me love, which I don't get from my family,"
Swarr says.;   Some of the young teens in the study actually had several
boyfriends or girlfriends. But the study found they weren't all that happy
with their situation. In fact, they felt less secure than most other kids.;  
ALCOHOL AND DRUGS: The bad news here is that even the good news isn't so good.
The National Institute on Drug Abuse proudly touts the fact that drug use
among teen-agers has dropped 18 percent since the early 1980s. When you read
the fine print, though, you find out that those surveys only include kids in
school, says Maria Felix-Ortiz of UCLA's psychology department.;   In other
words, for all we know, drug use among the huge number of dropouts may be at
an all-time high. "I suspect there's a serious problem out there," says
Felix-Ortiz. "The crack epidemic is very visible on the streets.";  
Psychologist Judy Andrews of the Oregon Research Institute in Eugene says kids
from one-parent families are the most likely to abuse alcohol and drugs,
especially when the non-custodial parent loses contact with the teen.;  
"There are fewer intact families than there ever were," she says.;   To make
things worse, one-parent families tend to move more, and that mobility
translates into fewer dependable friendships for teens already hungry for
stability, she adds. Lacking the support they need as they move through
adolescence, many teens turn to drugs and drink for solace.;   MONEY:
Teen-agers, who are feeling the economic pinch along with their parents, are
joining the work force in record numbers. "There's more students working now
than ever before," says Susan Papaccio of Colorado State University. In fact,
two-thirds of all teen-agers in junior high and high school have jobs.;  
There's no problem with that -- up to a point. But Papaccio's research shows
that when teens work more than 20 hours a week, their grades start to slide
precipitously. "A lot of work is right after school," she says. "They're too
tired to do any schoolwork.";   ACADEMICS: The absence of fathers from the
home scene has less-expected consequences, too. Carol Tomlinson-Keasey,
chairwoman of the psychology department at the University of California,
Riverside, says that the alarming slide in interest in science and math among
high schoolers -- only 7 percent choose those fields as majors when they start
college -- is related to the drop in two-parent families.;   Her reasoning:
The sciences traditionally attract more males, and fathers are critical role
models for their sons. For teen-age girls, fathers who talk up the sciences
can provide a counterforce to pressures to act mostly as "social animals.";  
"When you have a stepfather, often (he) is not as involved in (setting)
expectations for the kids," says Tomlinson-Keasey. "They're usually 'Mom's
kids.' . . . We need more dads who care more about their kids.";  
INDEPENDENCE: Rebellion and freedom were the code words of many teen-agers of
the 1950s and 1960s, largely because the families they grew up in were intact.
But now, with the divorce rate soaring, teens are finding that staying close
to one's family isn't so bad after all.;   In fact, says Maureen Kenny of
Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Mass., kids with strong family ties are
better at fending off depression and other emotional problems.;   "There's
been a revision of the model that says teen-agers need to cut themselves off
from their families," says Kenny. "Now kids are saying: 'I wish there was
someone I could be close to.' ";   Feminist thinking has even helped recast
the notion of dependency in more positive terms, says Kenny. In contrast to
the old view that girls were dependent on their families while boys were
adventurers in life, some psychologists now see the value of girls staying
close to their folks.;   "Just because women stayed connected with their
families doesn't mean they're dependent," says Kenny. "Having a secure
attachment with one's family contributes to better mental health.";   MENTAL
ILLNESS: Light, the Cal State therapist, says that what she saw at the
counseling center scared her.;   "It's not just, 'I'm having problems with my
boyfriend,' " she says. "It's not just developmental issues.";   Instead, the
center routinely deals with suicide attempts, psychosis and other forms of
"severe pathology," Light says. College counseling centers are looking more
and more like community mental health clinics, she says. Her advice is that
centers had better be prepared for dealing with serious mental illness on a
regular basis.;   "I don't think that 20 years ago college counseling centers
saw the extent of pathology that we're seeing now," she says. "The kids (of
divorce) suffer more than previously we had given them credit for."  </TEXT>

   The case of a psychologist charged with helping
to hide a 5-year-old from a mother who allegedly neglected the boy
is raising ethical questions for professionals who treat abused
children, experts say.
   Dennis M. Harrison, who has testified in prominent child custody
cases across the nation, was charged Sept. 18 with three counts of
conspiracy to harbor or hide Travis Lee Meriweather of Lexington
Park.
   Travis has been missing since a July 1987 visit to his father in
Hinton, Okla. Authorities believe he's being held by his father
somewhere.
   Harrison, the boy's grandfather, and a physician who has
examined him, claim the father was justified in vanishing with
Travis because he was virtually starved while in the care of his
mother.
   Some child abuse specialists say they are troubled by the
government's seizing of evidence _ handwritten notes and a
telephone bill for a call to Hinton _ from Harrison's office and
home.
   The records seizure and Harrison's arrest could have a
``chilling effect'' on medical professionals who treat abused
children, said Dr. Eli Newberger, director of the Family
Development Study at Children's Hospital and an assistant professor
of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
   ``To have confidential knowledge about a client seized by the
state threatens the entire therapeutic enterprise,'' said Jon
Conte, an associate professor of social work at the University of
Chicago.
   Harrison called his arrest an ``outrage.''
   ``This sends an ominous message to health professionals who try
to help troubled kids from broken homes that they are standing on
shaky, shaky legal ground,'' said Harrison, who is free on his
recognizance and faces trial Feb. 7.
   But D. Anne Emery, a St. Mary's County prosecutor, said she has
evidence that Harrison saw Travis at least twice knowing that state
and federal warrants had been issued for the boy and his father.
   ``This is a situation where somebody who doesn't like the
outcome of the court order just takes the law into their own hands
and does whatever he wants. It makes the very foundation of our
legal system ineffective,'' she said.
   The boy's grandfather, Leroy Meriweather of Hinton, Okla., said
Travis had grown increasingly thin while living with his mother,
Terry Treadway, 27.
   ``The baby had a bloated belly like those starving babies you
see on television in India and his hair was just falling out of his
head when it was brushed,'' he said.
   Treadway won custody when she divorced her husband, Michael Lee
Meriweather in Oklahoma in 1985. She moved to Maryland and agreed
to let Travis spend a week each month with his father.
   ``We've done just about everything we can do to find him and I'm
all torn up inside,'' she said in an interview.
   Dr. Donna Cosby, an Oklahoma City pediatrician who examined
Travis in 1986 and 1987, said he appeared to be underweight.
   ``He would systematically lose up to a half a pound every time
he visited his mother, and gain it back when he was with his dad.
Calories at that age are crucial to brain development, and kids
just can't afford to have their weight bounce back and forth like
that,'' she said.
   Treadway said Travis was perfectly healthy in her care.
   ``Kids are kids and some of them don't have the figures that
adults might expect them to have,'' she said.
   Harrison, 43, has testified on behalf of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a
Washington, D.C., plastic surgeon who has been in jail for hiding
her 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, from the courts since 1987. Morgan
has alleged that the child's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, sexually
abused the child, a claim Foretich denies.

   A 45-year-old father of six has been
convicted of molesting and sodomizing two teen-age daughters for
half of their lives and faces a sentence of life in prison.
   The conviction of Edward R. Dickey ended a weeklong trial marked
by tearful testimony from the daughters, ages 18 and 16.
   Dickey, a roofing contractor, cross-examined his daughters
himself on the first day of the trial. The 18-year-old testified
that her father had fondled and molested her since she was 9; the
16-year-old said her father began molesting her at age 8.
   Deidre Lee Dickey, 18, cried Friday when the verdict was read and
said her father's conviction was too severe. ``I think it was real
unfair,'' Miss Dickey said. ``He doesn't deserve to be in there
(jail) _ I've been there.''
   In the pre-trial phase of the case, Judge Bryant Huff had jailed
Deidre Lee and her mother, Peggy Sue Dickey, for more than a week
for refusing to testify.
   During the trial, Huff repeatedly chastised Dickey, who was
acting as his co-counsel, for what the judge called attempts to slow
the pace of the trial.
   In his closing arguments, Dickey quoted Thomas Jefferson, George
Washington and Jesus Christ and claimed courts use ``the most
extreme form of psychological warfare to coerce children to give
false testimony to convict parents of sexual abuse.''
   Assistant District Attorney Don Johstono also quoted Jesus,
telling the jury in his summation, ``It is better to have a
millstone around your neck and be thrown into the sea than to lead a
child to sin.''
   He told the jury there had, indeed, been brainwashing but that it
had been done by Dickey and his wife, not the government.
   After deliberating for morre than three hours, the jury convicted
Dickey on eight counts of child molestation, aggravated child
molestation, sodomy and aggravated sodomy.
   Huff ordered Dickey held without bond until sentencing on
Thursday.
   Dickey could be sentenced to life in prison for the aggravated
sodomy conviction and more than 150 years in prison on the others.
   Dickey's wife said her husband likely would appeal the verdict.
   Her next fight, she said, will be to regain custody of her
children from Gwinnett County officials.
   All of the Dickeys' children except Deidre Lee, the oldest, are
in custody of the county social services agency. The couple's
16-year-old daughter, a younger daughter and two young sons are in
foster care. The couple's 13-year-old daughter is staying at the
county children's shelter.
   Dickey also was charged with molesting the 13-year-old daughter,
but prosecutors agreed to drop the charge to spare the girl the
trauma of testifying.
   Johstono said the verdict affirmed that Dickey, who had no prior
criminal record, was ``a very sick individual.''

   Baby M is happy and secure with her
father and his wife and shows no more attachment to the surrogate
mother who refused to surrender her than she does to her
babysitter, the toddler's father testified today.
   William Stern, testifying at a court hearing over visitation
rights for surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, said he
believes his daughter should not be allowed to see Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould for several years.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who agreed to bear the child under a
$10,000 contract with Stern, currently is allowed to see the child
once a week for two hours under supervision.
   The visitation fight is the final legal phase of the court
battle involving Baby M, now Melissa Stern, who turned 2 Sunday.
The court hearing was ordered in a landmark ruling by the New
Jersey Supreme Court overturning surrogacy for pay.
   Both sides in the dispute strongly disagree over what would be
in the best interest of the girl, with the key issue centering on
whether continued contact with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould would be
harmful or healthy.
   The child, conceived by artificial insemination using Stern's
sperm, lives with Stern and his wife, Elizabeth, in their Tenafly
home.
   Stern likened Melissa to a young sapling that has to put down
its roots.
   ``If anything is done to interrupt her putting down those roots,
I'm afraid Melissa does not have much of a future,'' he said during
a half-hour of testimony.
   Melissa calls him ``Dada,'' and his wife, ``Mama,'' he noted.
   Stern acknowledged under cross-examination by Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Joel Siegal, that Melissa appeared to
be suffering no ill effects from her visits with Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould, and he said he would be willing to try to work out
a visitation arrangement if the court ordered one.
   ``The critical thing is that these adults can get on with their
lives, put the conflicts of the past behind them and support one
another,'' said Dr. David Brodzinsky, who acted as a
court-appointed psychologist in the widely publicized 1986 trial
that marked the first court ruling on a surrogacy contract.
   The judge in that trial barred Mrs. Whitehead-Gould from seeing
Melissa, but on Feb. 3 the state Supreme Court declared surrogacy
for pay illegal and restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's parental
rights, while granting custody to the Sterns.
   The Supreme Court, in ordering today's visitation hearing, made
no specific recommendations on visitation and gave the lower court
the ``broadest powers'' to resolve the issue.
   Mental health experts who have examined Melissa say she appears
to be unaffected by the legal storm around her. She was described
as friendly with adults, while being more attached to Stern than to
her mother.
   In court papers filed last week, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould says she
wants liberal, unsupervised visitation. The Sterns are seeking a
halt to visitation for several years.
   The session before Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween is
expected to last about three days. The high court ruled that the
issue of visitation must be resolved by early May.
   In court papers, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould says she wants visitation
immediately expanded to eight hours twice a week, unsupervised at
her home in East Brunswick. She says she wants the visits
eventually to include half the summer and some holidays.
   ``Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has fashioned an excellent relationship
with Melissa and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishing
and productive relationship,'' according to papers filed by her
attorney, Harold Cassidy.
   But the Sterns' attorney, Gary Skoloff, argues in court papers
that no contact would be better for the child because Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould does not offer a healthy environment for her,
particularly in the last year since the mother became pregnant out
of wedlock, divorced her former husband and married Wall Street
accountant Dean Gould.
   Skoloff did not spell out in the court papers how long contact
should be discontinued. In an interview, he said ``as long as
possible,'' and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys say the Sterns are
seeking a six-year moratorium on visits.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys see her divorce and remarriage
in a positive light, arguing that she has a more stable
relationship and financially secure lifestyle.

   Healthy Aging Hinges
   On Income, Education

   MONEY and schooling are the keys to healthy aging, a major
study concludes.
   Drawing on two large national surveys -- one involving
45,000 adults and the other 3,600 -- James S. House and five
colleagues from the University of Michigan's Institute for
Social Research analyzed how education, income, race, sex and
marital status correlate with health as people age. They
measured health both by the amount of such chronic conditions
as cancer, heart attacks and strokes and by the extent to
which respondents are limited in such daily activities as
walking and lifting.
   On average, whites were found healthier than blacks at
every age, men healthier than women and married people
healthier than the unmarried. But these differences were far
less striking than differences based on income and education.
   The researchers divided respondents into four
socioeconomic groups: high education and income, low
education and income, and two middle groupings. In early
adulthood, ages 25 to 34, health differences among the groups
are minimal.
   From then on, however, socioeconomic factors play an
increasing role, and the health of the four groups steadily
diverges. The health of the low socioeconomic group
deteriorates rapidly, that of the highest group declines
comparatively slowly and the two middle groups show an
intermediate pattern.
   Prevalence of chronic conditions, for example, peaks
between 55 and 64 for the lowest group, between 65 and 74 for
the lower middle group, and not until after 75 for the two
higher groups. A similar trend shows for loss of functional
capacity.
   Efforts to postpone chronic illnesses and disabilities
until very late in life, the researchers declare, must
involve measures to reduce socioeconomic differences earlier
in life.
                                                                                                       

   For Women, Remarriage
   Can Be Fruitful
                                                                                                       

   HALF THE WOMEN who remarry while still in their
childbearing years give birth in the second marriage.
   Howard Wineberg, a Portland State University demographer
in Oregon, examined the reproductive history of almost 4,000
women who married for the second time between 1960 and 1984
at an age of 35 or younger. By June 1985, 47.9% of the
remarried women had already given birth, and another 6.4%
expected to. Racial differences were slight.
   Most of the births occurred within 24 months of
remarriage. Not surprisingly, the younger a woman was at the
time of remarriage, the more likely she was to have a child
in the second marriage. And childbearing depended to a large
degree on the number of children the woman had before
remarriage. Women with two or more kids already were
"significantly less likely" to give birth in the second
marriage.
   Poorly educated white women, Mr. Wineberg says, were
considerably more likely to give birth in the second marriage
than high-school or college graduates. But among black women,
college graduates were more apt to have children in a second
marriage.
                                                                                                       

   Mental-Health Problems
   Prevalent in Children
                                                                                                       

   PSYCHOLOGICAL disorders affect almost 10.7 million
children, one out of every five under 18 years old.
   A 1988 government child health survey questioned parents
of more than 17,000 children about learning disabilities,
developmental delays and emotional or behavioral problems.
About seven million children -- more than 13% of all those
between three and 18 -- were reported to have had emotional
or behavioral problems lasting three months or longer or
requiring psychological treatment. These problems included
phobias and anxiety disorders, childhood depression and
aggressive or antisocial conduct.
   An estimated 3.4 million children, or 6.5% of those aged
three to 18, were said to have exceptional difficulty
learning to read and write or do arithmetic. About 2.5
million children, 4% of those between birth and 18, had some
delay in growth or development, ranging from Down's syndrome
to temporary problems due to early illness or injury. The
total number affected by some disorder is estimated at 10.7
million, with some children having problems in more than one
category.
   Analysts Nicholas Zill of Child Trends Inc., a nonprofit
research organization in Washington, D.C., and Charlotte
Schoenborn of the National Center for Health Statistics say
the results establish psychological disorders as being "among
the most prevalent chronic conditions of childhood and
adolescence." They note, for comparison, that 3.5 million
children have chronic bronchitis, 3.2 million have asthma and
1.1 million have heart murmurs.
   Possible causes for the "alarmingly high" level of
psychological disorders, they suggest, include growing
numbers of children who experience parental divorce, are born
outside marriage or are raised in low-income, single-parent
households; increased survival rates of very low birthweight
babies; and effects of environmental contamination.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   FATHERS are more likely to pay attention to daughters if
there are also sons in the family than if there are girls
only, say University of Pennsylvania researchers S. Philip
Morgan and Kathleen Harris. . . . Children from divorced
families tend to get sick more often than those in intact
families, University of California demographer Jane Mauldon
finds. She attributes this more to custodial parents' lowered
income than to children's emotional distress. . . .
Correctional jobs were the fastest-growing type of municipal
employment in 1989, the Census Bureau says.

<TEXT>
   Two men claiming fatherhood of a 7-year-old
girl are asking the U.S. Supreme Court for a Solomon-like decision
which could affect other fathers in so-called reverse paternity
cases.
   ``This case arises out of a societal phenomenon of men assuming
the responsibility we've always told them to assume as parents,''
says attorney Larry Hoffman. The case is scheduled to be heard
Tuesday by the high court.
   In the classic paternity case, a man who denies fathering a
child out of wedlock may be forced by the courts to take financial
responsibility for the child.
   ``I consider this a double reverse paternity case,'' Hoffman
says. ``We have not one, but two, men coming forward wanting to
support and care for this child.''
   Hoffman represents a married couple, Gerald and Carole Dearing,
who are fighting a suit by Michael Hirschensohn, Mrs. Dearing's
former lover.
   Hirschensohn, who says he is the biological father of Victoria
Dearing, wants visitation rights and ``the opportunity to be
involved in the child's life,'' says his attorney, Joel Aaronson.
   ``All he wants is to be able to visit with the child and give
the child the warmth and nurturing a parent gives a child,'' says
Aaronson.
   The problem is a California law which mirrors similar statutes
in other states. It holds that a woman's legal husband, unless he
is impotent or sterile, is the father of any child born during the
marriage.
   Aaronson says the law is outdated and unfair and wants the
Supreme Court to overrule it.
   The lawyer notes the increasing role of stepfathers and
stepmothers in the lives of children of divorce and says Victoria
would not be unique among her classmates if she was sharing her
time with two fathers.
   The events which created this legal triangle reflect the
complxities of life in the 1980s. The facts acknowledged by both
lawyers are these:
   Gerald and Carole Dearing were married in 1976. There were
separations, and from 1978 to 1984 Mrs. Dearing had an intermittent
sexual affair with Hirschensohn in Los Angeles and St. Thomas in
the Virgin Islands.
   In September 1980, Mrs. Dearing became pregnant. Her husband
attended Lamaze classes with her and was present in the delivery
room when the baby was born by Caesarean section on May 11, 1981.
   ``Gerald was the proudest of fathers...,'' his lawyer's brief
states.
   But Hirschensohn says Mrs. Dearing told him soon after the
baby's birth that the infant probably was his.
   Just after Victoria's first birthday, Dearing, the U.S.
representative of a French oil company, was transferred from Los
Angeles to New York. His wife and daughter stayed behind.
   Mrs. Dearing, Hirschensohn and the child then had blood tests
which showed a 98.07 percent probability that Hirschensohn was the
father. Dearing has not had a blood test and his lawyer claims it
is irrelevant because the law says he is the father.
   In the fall of 1982, Hirschensohn sued to be named Victoria's
legal father.
   There were upheavals in the Dearing marriage, and Mrs. Dearing
and Victoria lived with Hirschensohn intermittently until April
1984, when she accused him of ``peculiar behavior'' and obtained a
restraining order to keep him away from the little girl. That June,
she reconciled with her husband in New York.
   Since then, Hoffman said, the Dearings have had another child
and a third baby is due any day.
   Hirschensohn, a businessman who divides his time between St.
Thomas and Los Angeles, has not seen Victoria again except for one
brief visit in 1986.
   Appeals courts in California have ruled against Hirschensohn,
upholding a law they say was designed to protect the integrity of
the family.
   ``Marriage is a really sacred institution in the law,'' says
Hoffman. ``This law is traceable to antiquity.''
   In California, the concept of husband as father was written into
the state's first laws in 1872. Aaronson says it's time for the
courts to respond to societal changes.
   ``We've come to the point in society where we can prove a
biological connection between people who wish to be biologically
connected,'' he says, adding,``There may be a psychological father
as well as a biological father.'' Hoffman insists the biological
link is irrelevant.
   ``We think other things mean as much or more,'' he says.
``Because a man has biological responsibility does not make him a
better father.''

<LEADPARA>  How many parents actually consider their children's future sexual preference
when they first have kids? Relatively few. And yet it's an issue parents will
have to face: Will their children grow up to be straight or gay? According to
sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, about one out of 10 people is gay; at least one
family in every four has a homosexual member. Children who sense early on that
they are homosexual wrestle for years with a sense of "differentness,"a sense
of secrecy that often sets them apart from others. With virtually no gay role
models to look up to, coming to terms with their own homosexuality is a long
and often difficult process. Many parents inadvertently encourage their
children to keep such secrets; they don't want to know about their kids' sex
lives -- straight or otherwise. This pressure can be overwhelming: Almost
three times as many gay teen-agers attempt suicide as their straight
counterparts. Sociologists and anthropologists have observed homosexual
behavior in all races and societies, at all times in history; and many, such
as John DeCecco, professor of psychology at San Francisco State University and
editor of the Journal of Homosexuality, maintain it is "just another form of
sexual preference." In fact, DeCecco dismisses all current research as
homophobic. Yet there has been a great deal of research done on the issue of
sexual preference.;    Some believe, as Freud did, that parents influence a
child's sexual preference.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Many others -- a growing community of well-respected researchers -- believe
people are born gay or straight, that the origins of sexual preference are
biological.;    Whatever the theories, the issue of sexual orientation is a
compelling one in our society, and many parents feel uneasy contemplating the
possibility of homosexuality in their children.;    Guilt is common reaction; 
  The initial reaction of many parents to a child's homosexuality is a sense
of guilt and a belief that it stemmed  from something they did.;    Not
surprisingly, the issue of homosexuality is clouded with myths and
misinformation.;    The early psychoanalytic theories about homosexuality,
starting in 1905 with Freud, focused on environmental causes.;    Freud
described a particular family dynamic that produced gay children as composed
of a domineering mother and a weak or absent father.;    This combination
allegedly deprived the son of a strong male role model and caused him to
over-identify with, and fail to properly separate from, his mother.;    Today,
such theories have been widely dismissed.;    A pioneering, 12-year study of
more than 1,300 men and women, both gay and straight, by psychologists Alan
Bell, Martin Weinberg and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith at the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University in Bloomington,
looked at both groups' relationships with their mothers. They found the
connection between these relationships and the subjects' sexual orientation
"hardly worth mentioning.";    But a few psychoanalysts -- among them Dr.
Charles Socarides, clinical professor of psychiatry at New York's Albert
Einstein College of Medicine -- do believe in nurture over nature.;   
Socarides' controversial belief is that homosexuality is brought about by a
"disturbance in gender-defined self-identity" that takes place while the child
is under 3 years of age. Such a "disturbance" prevents the child from going
through the developmental steps that would lead him to have sexual feelings
for the opposite sex.;    Yet even psychologists who dismiss his theory
concede early childhood factors may play a part, if not in determining
homosexuality, then possibly in encouraging or discouraging its expression.;  
 For example, parents who wanted a girl might unconsciously let their feelings
influence their behavior toward a son.;    Another example is the boy whose
apparently "sissy" ways and his dislike of sports disappoint, and even repel,
his father; the child might cling more to his mother.;    Indeed, more
research points to the role of the father in these strained relationships.;   
Several studies on the homosexual development of boys outline poor
relationships between homosexual sons and their fathers.;    Dr. Richard
Green, in his ground-breaking book "The Sissy Boy Syndrome and the Development
of Homosexuality" (Yale University Press, 1987), compares the development of
44 "effeminate" boys with a control group of "masculine" boys.;    A
significant number of the effeminate boys' fathers recalled spending less time
with their sons than did fathers in the other group.;    Another researcher
who has observed important reverberations in the father/son relationship is
Dr. Richard Isay, clinical professor of psychiatry at Cornell Medical College
in New York City and author of "Being Homosexual: Gay Men and Their
Development" (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1989).;    Based on years of clinical
work with gay men, Isay has observed that as children, gay males seem to have
a particular need for closeness with their fathers -- a closeness often denied
because the father senses they are atypical.;    Isay, however, is firm in his
belief that children are born with this attraction for the same sex.;     The
seduction theory;  It is a commonly held belief that children can be "seduced"
into homosexuality; that a sexual encounter with an older person at a
formative stage can determine a child's sexual orientation for life.;    Not
so, say many of today's experts, insisting homosexuality is an innate drive,
not learned behavior.;    Anthropologist Gilbert Herdt, chairman of the
committee on human development at the University of Chicago, says: "There is
no evidence that someone's sexual identity can be permanently influenced by
another person.";  The biology theory;  It is the widely reported early sense
of difference that many gay men and women report, some believe, that seems to
indicate the origins of homosexuality are biological.;    And new studies have
uncovered various sets of factors that come into play either at birth or even
before, while the baby is still in utero, that may in time prove this.;    One
study by Lee Ellis, professor of sociology at Minot State University in North
Dakota, suggests homosexuality may be caused by stress experienced by the
mother during pregnancy.;    Extrapolating from data derived from studies on
laboratory rats, Ellis asked the mothers of 283 college-age children to recall
whether they had experienced stress during the pregnancy and at what stage.;  
 "We found mothers of the 39 homosexual males reported significantly more
severe stress during pregnancy -- all said it was in the second trimester,"
says Ellis.;    The reason maternal stress might play a part in a fetus'
sexual development, Ellis and other researchers believe, is that under stress
the body releases a particular set of hormones.;    "If these stress hormones
get to the fetus they can affect its brain in a way that temporarily stops the
production of sex hormones," Ellis explains.;     Many manifestations;  Just
as there may be many different explanations for homosexuality, so are there
many manifestations of it.;    As types, gay men range from very effeminate to
very masculine.;    Will your son grow up to be gay if he shows very
effeminate behavior, such as identifying only with girls? Possibly.;    The
consensus today is that real homosexual orientation -- as opposed to
homosexual behavior -- cannot be changed and trying to do this is both futile
and damaging to a child's self-esteem.;    But with the advent of AIDS and the
rise of discrimination and attacks on gays, there is no doubt homosexuality is
still regarded as a social stigma.;    How do parents get past their bias and
support their kids' individual impulses? By reminding themselves that "the
most important thing a parent can give a child is self-esteem," Reinisch
says.;    "Whatever our kids' sexual orientation," Reinisch says, "the
majority of parents want them to be happy and productive, to fall in love and
make a commitment -- to have a successful life. A successful life is not
something we can define by our own terms."  </TEXT>

<BYLINE>Mother Says Film About Custody Fight Exploits Children

<TEXT>
   A divorced father is helping to make a
movie about his seven-year custody-visitation battle over his
daughters, but the girls' mother has gone to court in hopes of
stopping what she sees as exploitation.
   Don Chavez, president of the National Congress for Men in
Washington and founder of the Albuquerque-based Dads Against
Discrimination, said the movie will be about ``Dad trying to regain
a meaningful place in the lives of his children.''
   The plot has a father organizing a group of other fathers in the
same situation in an attempt to change the way judges award custody
and visitation rights.
   ``What fathers do not see coming is the reality of getting
laundered from their children or emotionally amputated from their
children when they get divorced from their wives, and that's what
happened to me,'' Chavez said. ``And so the story starts with that
kind of a loving father who struggles for the better part of a
decade to regain his status as a real parent.
   ``A real parent does not mean being Uncle dad or a Disneyland
dad who visits with his children on weekends.''
   The girls' mother, Marilyn Chavez Newhouse, has asked state
District Judge Robert Thompson to appoint a guardian to determine
if the movie is in their best interest and to decide how to protect
them from future publicity.
   Daughters Leticia, 13, and Michelle, 11, live with Chavez, 38, a
Bureau of Indian Affairs administrator, during the school year and
with their remarried mother during the summer.
   Mrs. Newhouse contends in her petition that Chavez, who also has
remarried, failed to consult with her about ``the effect or
advisability of exposing the children to additional media
exploitation.''
   Chavez said Mrs. Newhouse won't communicate with him except
through their attorneys. He said his daughters favor the idea of a
movie.
   Chavez would not say what production company is making the film,
and said he's unsure when the movie will be ready because of delays
caused first by the writers' strike and now by the Hollywood
Teamsters' strike.

   A parent may consent on behalf of a
child to donate bone marrow to a sibling, but only when it would be
in the child's best interest, the Illinois Supreme Court said
Thursday.
   Justices made the ruling to explain their decision Sept. 28 to
uphold a judge's order refusing to force a leukemia victim's young
half-siblings to be tested as potentially life-saving bone-marrow
donors.
   The leukemia victim, 13-year-old Jean-Pierre Bosze, died Nov. 19
at his home in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates after a
two-year illness.
   In dealing with that case, the high court cited three factors
that must be weighed in future cases to determine when a parent or
guardian can approve a child's being a transplant donor:
   -The parent or guardian must be informed of the risks and
benefits inherent in the donation.
   -Emotional support must be available to the child from his
caretakers.
   -A close relationship must exist between the donor and
recipient.
   ``The evidence clearly shows that there is no physical benefit
to a donor child,'' wrote Justice Harold Calvo for the court's
majority. ``If there is any benefit to a child who donates bone
marrow to a sibling it will be a psychological benefit.''
   Calvo said the psychological benefit is grounded firmly in the
fact that the donor and recipient know each other as family.
   Jean-Pierre's father, Tamas Bosze, had petitioned for a court
ruling to force Nancy Curran - his former girlfriend and the mother
of Jean-Pierre's twin half-siblings - to have the 3-year-olds
tested as possible donors.
   Attorneys for the father and a court-appointed guardian for
Jean-Pierre had urged the justices to order the testing of the
twins on the legal theory that if the twins were adults, they would
agree to it.
   However, the high court refused to apply the legal doctrine of
substituted judgment. No dissents were filed.
   ``Because each twin is only 3{ years of age, neither has yet had
the opportunity to develop `actual, specific express intent,' or
any form of intent, with regard to serving as a bone marrow
donor,'' Calvo said.
   Edward Jordan, an attorney for the father, said he was
disappointed the court rejected his arguments, but optimistic about
cases to come.
   ``We have established a framework that can save lives in the
future,'' he said.
   Charles Fleck, the court-appointed guardian for the twins,
applauded the justices for taking a common sense approach.
   ``They didn't want to get into a `Brave New World' situation
where people start taking minors to save the life of Mother Teresa
or the president or somebody else,'' he said. ``They focused on the
best interests of the minor.''

<HL> Letters to the Editor: Helping Children Adjust to Divorce </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   I read with interest your article "Kids Are Often Losers in Joint Custody" (second front page, Sept. 22). 
As director of the Children of Separation and Divorce Project at the Family Life Center Inc. (a private, nonprofit, community mental-health center), my staff and I have facilitated more than 60 therapeutic/support groups for children and youths ages eight to 19. 
As part of our clinical services, we work with all significant adults in the child's life -- both parents (custodial and non-custodial), teachers, other therapists, grandparents, etc. 

   Basically, we are in agreement with the points Clare Ansberry makes in her article. 
Joint custody is one alternative in helping the child adjust to divorce in healthy ways. 
The recent passage of a bill in California repealed the emphasis joint custody had previously been given. 
Joint custody works well when two parents clearly can maintain a businesslike parenting relationship with the needs of their child superseding their own. 
Other factors include the child's personality, his relationship with each parent, his age and feelings about his living situation. 

   Our staff has one suggestion for both parents prior even to a mutual separation. 
Find out what children experience when their parents separate and how parents can help the children to adjust. 
For the past two years, we have combined forces with lawyers, divorce mediators, judges, child-support personnel, financial planners, career planners and family therapists to provide couples recently separated or contemplating separation the opportunity to find out the impact of their decision in many different areas and what they can do to help their children. 
Children who have been through a divorce volunteer to speak to this group of parents to share their feelings and discuss how they coped. 

   We strongly urge parents to locate similar helping resources before they are in the middle of their own personal turmoil so that they can make thoughtful, healthy decisions for their children and themselves.

   Regarding your article on joint custody, there is a mountain of research that shows two parents are generally better than one for healthy child development. 

   More than 20 independent researchers and prominent mental-health professionals show the benefits of co-parenting. 
These researchers focus on the majority of children -- the norm -- not on isolated cases of continuously litigating parents, as Judith Wallerstein has done in her apparent attempt to prop up sole maternal custody. 

   It is interesting that despite 60 years of sole maternal custody, there is not one study that shows it is generally good for kids to have only one parent. 
Even with continuously litigating parents, the worst thing one can do is create a "parentectomy," the removal of one parent from the life of the child, according to Dr. Frank S. Williams, director of Family and Child Psychiatry at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 

   In research presented to the American Bar Association Family Law Section in 1987 and 1988, Dr. Williams said that parental identity -- if strengthened in both parents -- can increase cooperation, and that there should be a rebuttable presumption for joint custody in this country. 

   Children need their fathers as well as their mothers. 
Public policy should reflect this basic and powerful need. 

   David L. Levy
   President, National Council for Children's Rights
   Washington
   ---
   There is voluminous evidence of the harm sole custody does to the children of divorce and the promise that joint custody holds for them. 

   When children are placed in day care, they must put up with back-and-forth transport to their day-care centers and conform to the regimen of their care givers. 
Some children do not take well to day care. 
Is this an argument for abolishing day care for all children? 
When children go to school, they have to cope with schedules and adapt to their teachers' personalities. 
Some children are depressed by this. 
Is this a sufficient argument for doing away with elementary education? 

   Similarly, when parents divorce, their children generally will have to spend some time with each parent. 
In joint custody, children see their fathers more often than in sole custody. 
This is generally considered a good thing. 
Nevertheless, some children adjust to joint custody less well than others. 
Is the discomfiture of the few a justification for altering arrangements that work for the majority who try them? 

   Truth be told, wholesale opposition to joint custody by some "experts," though cloaked in concern for children, has other motivations: Child support is usually paid to custodial mothers. 
Some feminists, including those cited by Ms. Ansberry, fear that joint custody dilutes the claims of custodial mothers to child support and vitiates their ability to trade visitation for additional payments from fathers. 
Obviously, this calculus has nothing to do with the needs of children for the company of their fathers. 
Child support is an independent factor that should be -- and fortunately, in most jurisdictions, is -- reckoned on its own terms by the courts. 

   Sole custody is a major producer of single-parent families. 
Single-parent families are a major social problem. 
The problems of a minority of joint-custody children pale by comparison.

<HEAD>Couple Won't Seek Custody Of Child They Think Was Swapped At Birth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple won't seek custody of a 10-year-old
girl they believe is their daughter, but they still want genetic
testing done to determine whether they are her real parents, their
lawyer said Friday.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., would settle for a
chance to visit with the girl, and make her part of their family,
said John Blakely, the Twiggs' attorney.
   ``They were becoming very frustrated with the public's
perception. They have always intended to do what is best for
everyone,'' said Blakely.
   The Twiggs filed a lawsuit last year seeking genetic testing of
the girl, Kimberly Mays. The girl's father, Robert Mays, a roofing
supply salesman from Sarasota, is fighting to block the tests.
   The Twiggs claim they brought the wrong child home from Hardee
Memorial Hospital in Wauchula in 1978, and that Robert and Barbara
Mays took their child the same day.
   The girl the Twiggs raised, named Arlena, died of a congenital
heart defect last August. They learned through blood tests that she
was not their daughter.
   Kimberly and Arlena were the only two white baby girls in the
hospital at the same time. The Twiggs, who maintain hospital
personnel deliberately switched their healthy daughter for a sickly
child, have asked a Sarasota court to order genetic testing to
determine Kimberly's parentage.
   ``This doesn't change the lawsuit at all,'' Blakely said.
   In December, Mays said Kimberly inscribed a drawing she gave him
for Christmas: ``I hate the Twiggs. I want them to go away.''
   Mays' wife, Barbara, died of cancer in 1981. He remarried and
later divorced.
   Mrs. Twigg said she and her husband first considered seeking
custody because they suspected Mays participated in the alleged baby
swap, but now there is no evidence to support that.
   The Twiggs, who have seven children, later grew concerned about
public sentiment that they were being unfair to Kimberly. They say
they have received hate mail comparing them to terrorists.
   ``You take a step back and say, `What is in the best interest of
everybody involved?''' Mrs. Twigg told The Tampa Tribune in an
interview published in Friday editions, breaking four months of
silence in the case. ``We feel that we should not be denied the
right to know that girl as a child.''
   Blakely said while there have been no discussions with Mays or
his attorney, Arthur Ginsburg, the Twiggs should be the ones to
determine extent of the visitation, relying on guidance from
psychologists and psychiatrists.
   ``I think the only basis the Twiggs would seek custody is if some
professional told them it would be in Kimberly's best interest to
remove her from Mr. May's house, which we do not anticipate,'' said
Blakely.
   Ginsburg was not available Friday, his office said. Mays could
not be reached; he has an unpublished telephone number.

<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- I will not be able to sleep until I respond to "Uneasy Mother" who
was molested by her father. Her mother knew but did nothing to protect her.
She moved out of the house when she turned 18, got therapy and went on to be a
fairly well-adjusted person.;   After a while, she was able to forgive her
father and wrote to tell you that they now have a very pleasant relationship.
Her question: Should she allow her two young daughters to spend the night at
Grandpa and Grandma's house? Her parents keep asking and the little girls
would like to.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Your correspondent thought it possible her father was over his "problem."
He's in his 60s now and besides, her mother is always there.;   Your response
was, "Absolutely not. Your mother didn't protect you -- what makes you think
she would protect your daughters?";   I was abused by my stepfather and I,
too, moved out when I turned 18. After a few years, I resumed the relationship
for my mother's sake and was ready to let bygones be bygones. My daughter was
then 18 months old.;   I convinced myself (and my husband) that my stepfather
would never touch our daughter, and I allowed her to sleep at Grandma and
Grandpa's house on many occasions. My mother died in 1985 and a few years
later, my stepfather was arrested for sexual molestation. His way of dealing
with the problem was to commit suicide. Meanwhile, my daughter, who is now 20,
has been hospitalized in a psychiatric unit several times. There is no doubt
in my mind that she was sexually abused by my stepfather.;   I am trying hard
to come to terms with my guilt for exposing my daughter to this man.;   --
J.T. in Virginia; DEAR J.T. -- Thanks for a fine letter. There were thousands
on this subject, all with a similar message. Read on:;   This is for that
idiot woman who was sexually abused by her father and isn't sure whether to
allow her small daughters to spend the night at her parents' home. For Lord's
sake, lady, you would have to be crazy to take such a chance. Don't you know
sexual abusers are forever a risk? Don't do it.;   -- Toronto;   Forty years
ago my father molested my sister. He was always drunk when he did this. My
sister finally told a neighbor. The neighbor told my mother, who divorced my
father promptly. He cleaned up his act and remarried. He also quit drinking
and we became a family again.;   I wish this was the end of the story, but it
isn't. He went on to sexually molest my daughters and my nieces. How foolish I
was to believe a molester could change. I will carry the guilt to my dying
day.;   -- Otis, Ore.;   DEAR READERS -- Victims of child abuse must get
counseling. Please send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to V.O.I.C.E.S.

<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Until recently, she wouldn't have gotten much argument from psychologists,
sociologists, marriage counselors, family scholars. The United States has
always been the most divorce-prone society in the l,0p2 world, and as rates
started to soar in the mid-1960s, a good deal of elite opinion focused more on
the expansion in freedom for adults than on the possible harm to children of
broken marriages.;    "I think we were all real naive for a while in thinking
that divorce did not have a serious impact on kids," says Anna Beth
Benningfield, president-elect of the American Association for Marriage and
Family Therapy (AAMFT), which has been debating whether counselors should
bring a more anti-divorce bias to therapy. "But I'd say the bloom is off the
rose.";    The second look has been triggered by new studies that show the
harmful effects of divorce on children are
longer-,2p,2p3,2p6,3p2,3p4,3p6,3p6,3p3,3p,2p8,2p5,2p2,1p8,1p7,1p
6,1p6,1p8,1p10,2p1,3p,3p3,4p4 lasting than once had been thought. Children of
divorce perform less well in school, have more behavioral and psychological
problems and a greater tendency (once they become adults) to divorce than
children raised by both biological parents.;    To be sure, domestic violence
and other problems of high-conflict marriages are damaging to children and
even experts intent on saving marriages acknowledge divorce is sometimes the
best alternative.;    "We want to be careful not to say that every child who
has been through a divorce will be scarred for life . . . or that every child
raised in a traditional two-parent family will turn out fine," says Nicholas
Zill, executive director of Child Trends Inc., a Washington-based firm that
does research on children's issues.;    "But if you looked at the kind of
long-term risk factors that divorce creates for kids and translated them to,
say, heart disease, people would be startled," he says.;    "For years experts
said, 'Once the initial trauma wears off, kids make adjustments.' Well, so do
people in prisons and mental institutions," says John Guidubaldi, a psychology
professor at Kent State University and past president of the National
Association of School Psychologists. "The pertinent question is: Are those
adjustments healthy? The weight; of the evidence has become overwhelming on
the side that they aren't.";    Guidubaldi argues laws and mores have gone too
far in sanctioning no-fault, no-guilt divorce.;    "People simply aren't
putting enough effort into saving their marriages," he says. "I think the old
argument of staying together for the sake of the kids is still the best
argument.";    'Divorce-Buster';    Such views are still controversial. But in
the past few years, a rally-'round-marriage movement has begun to stir among
psychologists who worry about the impact of divorce on children, legal
scholars who argue a children-first policy should be written into divorce law,
and marriage counselors who have come to believe divorce is a cure worse than
the disease.;    One sign of the times was the title of the keynote address at
the annual meeting of the 17,000 member AAMFT last fall: "Divorce-Buster.";   
"I'm passionate about saving marriages," says Michele Weiner-Davis, a
Woodstock, Ill., family therapist who delivered the address. Her modus
operandi, she explains, is to "concentrate on what works in a couple's
marriage rather than on what doesn't.";    When Cathy and Jerry Hicks came in
to see her last fall, Weiner-Davis instructed them to draw up a list of the
things they did together that made them happiest, then rearrange their daily
routines so they did those things as often as possible. She told them to
negotiate a specific number of hours each weekend that Jerry would do
housework, which had been a source of friction.;    And she suggested that if
Cathy felt she needed to ask questions about past conflicts that had led her
to the brink of divorce, such conversations should have a half-hour time
limit.;    "A lot of her homework exercises seemed sort of silly, but it
turned out to be exactly what we needed," says Jerry, an executive with a
telecommunications company. "I feel more committed to our marriage than I ever
have," says Cathy.;    Not all cases have such happy endings; nor is there any
guarantee that there aren't rough patches ahead for the Hicks. But
Weiner-Davis is convinced counselors can -- and should -- make a difference in
keeping marriages together.;    The scapegoat;    This is causing conflict
within the therapeutic community. Classical clinical training teaches
counselors to be bias-free; to help clients do whatever seems most appropriate
given their particular circumstances. "The trouble with therapists trying to
impose their values on clients is that it's the clients who have to live with
the consequences," says Benningfield, the AAMFT president-elect.;    "Divorce
has become a scapegoat, the easy sacrificial institution on which to lay blame
for many of society's problems," says Constance Ahrons, a Southern California
therapist who spoke at the AAMFT conference in response to Weiner-Davis. She
says divorce is "often a pathway to a happier life.";    Weiner-Davis counters
that there is no such thing as value-free counseling. "We declare our biases
by the questions we choose to ask," she says. "For a therapist to be neutral
when someone is about to jump off a building -- that's not neutrality," adds
Frank Pittman, a therapist from Atlanta and another staunch marriage-saver. "I
have always felt that people who are in crisis make bad decisions. It is
foolhardy to expect otherwise. It's our job to give them a reality check.";   
These "reality checks" may already be rippling through the culture. After
doubling from 1965 to 1980, divorce rates have leveled off at about 10 percent
below their peak of a decade ago. Some analysts attribute the decline to the
fear of AIDS; others to the aging of much of the baby-boom generation out of
their 20s -- the high-risk divorce years.;    But some speculate that the
research on long-term consequences of divorce has led to social learning.
"I've had family therapists all over the country tell me they have couples
coming in for counseling with my book tucked under their arm and a look of
concern on their faces," says Judith S. Wallerstein of Corte Madera, whose
best-selling 1989 book, "Second Chances: Men, Women and Children a Decade
After Divorce," popularized the alarmist view of the impact of divorce on
children.;    Among other findings, the study by Wallerstein and Sandra
Blakeslee of 60 middle-class divorced families in Marin County showed that
while boys are apt to experience the greatest trauma at the time of divorce
and suffer most from the father-absence that typically follows divorce, girls
are more prone to a "sleeper effect" that makes it difficult for them to
establish stable male-female relationships once they become adults.;    An
ongoing decade-long study by Guidubaldi of 699 families in 38 states has shown
children of divorce are more likely than children in traditional, intact
families to engage in drug abuse, violent behavior, suicide and out-of-wedlock
child bearing. A study by Zill for the National Institute of Mental Health
showed that, once they become adolescents, children who were under age 7 when
their parents were divorced were three times more likely to be receiving
psychological counseling and five times more likely to have been suspended or
expelled from school than children of intact families.;    Critics of these
studies note that when one compares children of divorce to children of
conflict-ridden families, the results are murkier. Zill counters that only
about 15 percent of marriages involve violence or high levels of conflict, but
roughly 50 percent of marriages end in divorce. "There is no question that
persistent conflict in marriage is bad for children, but a lot of divorces
don't fall in that category," he says.;    Marriage counselors aren't the only
professionals who are reappraising divorce. Harvard professor Mary Ann Glendon
has proposed an overhaul of divorce laws to assure that, in the 60 percent of
all divorces involving minor children, "A judge's main task would be to piece
together, from property and income and in-kind personal care, the best
possible package to meet the needs of children and their physical custodian.";
   No state has language like that in its divorce code. Studies show that
following a divorce, children and their custodial parent -- typically their
mother -- see their standard of living drop sharply, while non-custodial
parents see theirs rise.;    Others have called for a cooling-off period to be
built into divorce proceedings when children are involved, and -- in the most
draconian proposal of the burgeoning divorce-buster movement -- historian and
author Christopher Lasch has called for a constitutional amendment that would
forbid parents with minor children from divorcing.;    Will the new activism
on the anti-divorce front change people's behavior?;    "I may be wildly and
foolishly optimistic," says Zill, "but as more information gets out that we
have yet to find a good substitute for the traditional two-parent family, I
think a change is bound to occur.";    "Divorce is here to stay," counters
Ahrons, a marriage counselor who looks askance at the divorce-buster movement.
"We ought to help people learn how to manage it, which is not an easy thing."  </TEXT>

MAN GETS PROBATION FOR KILLING HIS FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young Glendale man found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the killing his 
father was sentenced Friday to three years on probation by a Pasadena Superior 
Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the probation, Arnel Salvatierra, 20, promised to undergo 
regular psychiatric counseling. Salvatierra was 17 when he shot his father, 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatierra's sentencing had been delayed for almost three months after his 
attorneys requested time for three psychologists to examine him. Under 
California law, a minor convicted in Superior Court must be examined by a 
court-approved diagnostic expert before he can be sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatierra has been free on his own recognizance since Dec. 30, when a jury 
found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter, the lesser of two charges in the 
shooting. He was acquitted of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing hearing before Judge Gilbert C. Alston, Salvatierra's 
attorney, Marcia Morrissey, called the sentence "appropriate." She said the 2 
1/2 years her client spent in custody in Juvenile Hall in Eastlake had 
rehabilitated him. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Wondries, who prosecuted the case, called 
Salvatierra "a very dangerous kid." She said Salvatierra only began receiving 
counseling four months ago, when he was released from custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Arnel has made a great deal of progress, but Arnel is a long way from being 
rehabilitated," Wondries said. "All the experts agree that Arnel needs 
intensive psychological counseling." 
</P>
<P>
The January, 1986, slaying of Oscar Salvatierra attracted international 
attention when it was disclosed that, on the day before his death, he had 
received a written death threat. Police at first suggested that the threat 
might be related to the Filipino newspaper he worked for being critical of 
then-President Ferdinand Marcos. But authorities later disclosed that his son 
had made the threat. 
</P>
<P>
During his three-week trial, Arnel Salvatierra testified that his father had 
abused him. He admitted that he had planned the slaying for weeks before 
shooting his father in the head while he was sleeping in the family's north 
Glendale home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Living With Mother 
</P>
<P>
Arnel Salvatierra has been living with his mother, two sisters and a brother 
since January and is a student at a Los Angeles-area college, Morrissey said. 
She would not disclose the name of the college. 
</P>
<P>
On April 7, Theresa K. DeBurger of Glendale -- Arnel Salvatierra's 
then-girlfriend, who was accused of hiding the clothing he wore when he killed 
his father -- was sentenced to two years' probation and fined $715. Last year, 
DeBurger pleaded no contest to being an accessory after the fact in the 
slaying.

FATHER TAKES BOY, 3 IN FREEWAY SLAYING

<P>
Three-year-old Andre Keith Bakker IV, who witnessed the weekend shooting death 
of his mother and watched her boyfriend turn the gun on himself as they drove 
down the San Diego Freeway, was released Monday from an Orange County 
children's shelter to the custody of his father. 
</P>
<P>
The boy "is aware that his mother is dead," said Kim Berry, a friend of the 
family. "But he just says that 'Mommy's in heaven.' " 
</P>
<P>
Young Andre is described as a "precocious but mature" toddler, but relatives 
and officials at Orange County Children's Services remain concerned that he may 
suffer psychological trauma from the weekend ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
A California Highway Patrol officer found the boy in a back seat of his 
mother's car after she had been shot repeatedly by George Charles Woodford III, 
28, on Saturday night. The mother, Audrey Denise Davis, 33, died from bullet 
wounds to her head and body. Woodford, who had been arguing with Davis, then 
shot himself in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The car continued down the freeway out of control, finally grinding to a halt 
in the southbound car-pool lane north of the Springdale Street exit in 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Howard, Children's Services director, said that releasing the boy to the 
custody of his father, Andre Bakker III, of Los Angeles, was the "best thing" 
to do for Andre. Bakker could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The father has had regular contact with the boy and has visits every other 
week. The child knew him and called him 'Dad' and obviously showed very 
appropriate reaction to his father," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities initially believed that Bakker did not play an active role in young 
Andre's upbringing, but they found otherwise after conducting a background 
check, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this man had been involved with the child," Howard said, describing 
a warm reunion between Andre and his father at Orangewood Children's Home in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Police continued to puzzle Monday over exactly what motivated Woodford, a 
self-employed car detailer, to fire the fatal gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
But the dead woman's family described Woodford as "extremely possessive" and 
jealous of Audrey Davis. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Kentucky, Woodford met Davis while she was buying a car. Davis 
became the registered owner of a 1976 AMC Pacer, the vehicle in which the 
murder-suicide occurred Saturday, according to the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles. Woodford moved into her Long Beach home just four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster police consider their investigation of the tragedy almost 
concluded, Lt. Andrew Hall said. Police do not know how and when Woodford got 
his hands on the weapon used. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Davis told her family that Woodford owned a gun but had hocked it for 
cash from a pawnbroker, said Berry, the girlfriend of Davis' brother, Vincent 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Woodford, Audrey Davis and young Andre were on the way to the home of the boy's 
grandmother when the tragedy occurred Saturday night. Audrey Davis' other son, 
13-year-old Frankie, was being tended by Berry and Vincent Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
If the other youngster had been along, the episode might not have exploded out 
of control, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankie didn't want to go to his grandmother's house, so Audrey and George 
left him with us," Berry said. "Had he been with them, maybe he would have 
prevented it or stopped it because he's a very big 13-year-old." DAVID REYES

   Study of Baby Talk
   Is in Its Infancy;

   Is the Song Universal?

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- In a cubicle in the Stanford
University psychology department, Joseph Pollard is being
analyzed. He responds nicely and is thanked the way all test
subjects here are thanked.
   "You were PER-fect," coos the research assistant. Then he
is handed the usual honorarium, a shiny toy car, which he
stashes in his diaper bag.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Master Pollard, at 19 months of age, is one of the more
senior volunteers in one of the hotter fields in the
psychology of child development: baby talk.
   That's right. Baby talk is controversial stuff in psych
circles these days.
   Baby talk is not babies talking ("goo goo"), but the
"exaggerated melodies of motherese," according to Anne
Fernald, a professor here. This infant-directed speech is a
kind of music mothers and fathers use to communicate with
their children long before the words make any sense.
   Jerry McRoberts, a Stanford speech scientist who charts
speech tones on a computer screen, demonstrates by playing a
tape of a session with a mother, baby and toy animals. He
analyzes it like a sportscaster doing play-by-play
commentary.
   Mother: "Spencer, what's this? Is it a PIG? We LOVE the
PIG] {Interlude of snort sounds.} And here's a DOG-gy. Look
at the DOG-gy. Nice DOG-gy. We love the DOG-gy] Yeeah]"
   Mr. McRoberts: "Mom's really laying it on. She's
effectively doubling her pitch to 500 hertz {a measure of
frequency} from 250 hertz. She's using all the tricks in her
bag to keep him interested."
   Mother: "Here's his NOSE, and his EYES, and his PAWS. And
he's SOFT. Niiice DOG-gy."
   Mr. McRoberts: "Note the swooping pitch-contours Mom uses
to label the target words. It's real selective, real
strategic."
   Prof. Fernald, who works with Mr. McRoberts, contends high
pitch and tonal contrast are most salient in baby talk.
Partly because babies hear better at high frequencies, it
grabs their attention, arouses their emotions and highlights
new words. Similarly, adults hearing a speech may find their
emotions roused more by the tonal contrasts of a Martin
Luther King than the tonal monotony of a Henry Kissinger.
   Prof. Fernald also believes baby talk is innate,
cross-cultural and an aid to language development.
   For instance, adults around the world use similar tonal
patterns to comfort or alert infants, her studies contend.
Baby talk flourishes in English, French, German, Italian,
Chinese, Japanese, Latvian, Arabic and some Native American
tongues.
   "The melody is the message," Prof. Fernald says. To be
sure, in tonal languages like Chinese, too wild a pitch
variation can change the meaning of "cat" to "hat." But
parents there spice up statements in other ways -- for
example, doubling words to say, "Look at the pig-pig." A
Japanese parent would also add a pig sound -- "boo boo" --
for effect.
   Prof. Fernald believes -- as do researchers in many
academic centers -- that baby talk is a genetically coded
behavior that humans evolved for communicating with their
young. "If you're ever going to find an evolved behavior,
you'll find it in the care of infants," she asserts.
   To some, all this may sound obvious. But actually, the
interest in early cognition signals a change in the way some
social scientists think about babies. "As late as the 1960s,
some people thought infants were cabbages," says Prof.
Fernald, who gets grant support from the National Institutes
of Health.
   Other scholars doubt her claims that baby talk is
universal or essential to learning language and pooh-pooh her
methods.
   Clifton Pye, a linguistics professor at the University of
Kansas, says that among the K'iche' Mayan Indians of Western
Guatemala, parents use the same tones when speaking to
children or adults. Anne Fernald's "claims have largely been
based on middle-class parents observed in a university
setting," he says.
   Nor does everyone buy into the genetic theory of
motherese. Joseph Colombo, a professor of human development
at the University of Kansas, argues babies aren't born to
love high-pitched sounds, nor is baby talk part of the
biological blueprint.
   "I'm quite skeptical," adds Kenneth Wexler, a professor of
psychology and linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Like his colleague Noam Chomsky, Mr. Wexler
believes people are genetically programmed to learn language,
so that vocal sweeteners don't much matter. "There are kids
who grow up in orphanages who speak adequately."
   Yet others defend the study of baby talk, because it
provides a key to understanding normal and dysfunctional
families. "Do I think it's important to speak to children?
Yes I do," says T. Berry Brazelton, the well-known author and
Harvard University professor of pediatrics. "It should be
intuitive," he adds, "but with high-risk children, that isn't
true." (Indeed, Barbara Bettes of Cornell University found
that depressed mothers don't engage in responsive baby talk;
thus, their babies must strain to decode adult messages.)
   Prof. Fernald insists detractors like Prof. Pye base their
critiques on inadequate data. Motherese may not be universal,
but she contends it isn't just a cultural quirk, like the
American penchant for dressing a girl in pink or a boy in
blue. She notes that in South Africa, speakers of Xhosa, a
rural click language, indulge in a high-pitched baby talk.
   "These were women with babies on their backs in huts in
native homelands," she notes -- not the F.A.O. Schwarz set.
"Yet the intonation patterns were the same."
   With some amusement, she plays a videotape bolstering her
view of baby talk as a sort of maternal Esperanto. American
babies are shown listening to tapes of Greek, German and
Japanese. When foreign mothers scolded, the babies winced and
knitted their brows. When the mothers praised, the babies
smiled and flirted.
   "This is a strange thing to do to babies," says Prof.
Fernald. "It's amazing to me we got anything. But the babies
do respond."
   Outside academic circles, it isn't always so amazing. Long
before the arrival of his son Matthew, Tony Norcia of Palo
Alto perfected "a whole sound repertoire -- Donald Duck talk,
clicks, whistles, the raspberries" while working with babies
in vision research. He spurns the term motherese. "It's
parentese, obviously. And I do it all the time."
   Prof. Fernald points out that French fathers, especially,
will respond when asked if they baby talk: "Moi? Jamais]" But
they will indulge their wee ones like other babbling dads.
   Researchers say that studying baby talk can be trying.
"Infants give you four minutes," says Prof. Fernald. "After
that, they throw up or fall asleep." In few other fields are
experiments canceled due to fussiness. One recent volunteer
leapt off his mother's lap, knocking over a hidden camera and
collapsing the test booth.
   Almost as irksome to researchers are parents who insist on
glorifying their little prodigies. "One father came in," says
a research assistant. "His baby touched my leg and muttered
something. The father swore he'd said `pantyhose.'"

<HEAD>`Jersey City': A Play About Children with Trauma</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Off-Broadway's Second Stage, founded, like a
thrift shop, to give good products a second home, is increasingly
turning to the presentation of new plays.
   The latest effort is ``Jersey City,'' which opened Wednesday
night. Its protagonists are two adolescents, damaged by childhood
traumas, trying to become adults.
   The girl, Magaly, has been forced into incest by her father
since she was 5. The boy, David, had his father taken away and
found his brother's body after a shooting in the streets of San
Salvador.
   They run away and meet in Jersey City, N.J.
   The play, written by Wendy Hammond, moves with realism and
suspendse to a hope-filled ending. Ms. Hammond has had two previous
plays done outside New York.
   The story begins in Brooklyn, with Magaly's never-visible mother
working nights and father slapping and knocking her into
submission. Then he rapes her. Sex scenes are done with actors
clothed or partly clothed.
   Magaly and David are impossibly nice and well-adjusted,
considering what they've been through. This makes the play easier
for the audience to take.
   But their problems aren't glossed over. Esther, a bar dancer who
sends Magaly home with David to escape her father's pursuit, also
is impossibly nice. But her problems as a mother of two children
with different fathers are real.
   Megaly and David fall in love, but she remains troubled by her
past. She has nightmares. And she can't make love without being hit.
   She eventually finds free counseling.
   The playwright has simplified their problems, focusing on the
psychological harm wrought by child abuse and shock.
   The acting was first-rate, by two ``Sesame Street'' veterans,
Alison Bartlett as Magaly and Eddie Castrodad as David, Jude
Ciccolella as Pa and Adina Porter as Esther.
   The director was Risa Bramon, a member of the Ensemble Studio
Theater.

   `Dumbo' Ears, Banana Noses
   Can Be Fixed at a Price --

   As an eighth-grade graduation present, Kristina Olson got
new ears from her mother. Leigh Kane, at 17, got a new nose.
   Since last month, Danielle Borngiorno, 14, has had
narrower hips and thinner thighs. Her mother offered to pay
for breast implants, too, but Danielle decided against that,
for the time being. She is still considering chin and nose
work and a cheek implant. "Now, {it's} just like, let's go
every week and get something improved on. There are so many
things you can do," says Danielle, who lives in Brooklyn,
N.Y.

   Why bother with padded bras and Clearasil when silicone
and dermabrasion promise permanence? Why spend one's
adolescence brooding about receding chins or big ears when it
is so simple to have plastic surgery?
   To the dismay of at least some psychologists and medical
doctors, cosmetic surgery is now hardly more exotic than
orthodontics among children whose parents have the
wherewithal to pay $600 or $6,000 for a surgical procedure to
improve on nature. Statistics don't exist, but many plastic
surgeons say their teen-age clientele has doubled in the past
five years and now is as much as 25% of their business.
   Nose and ear jobs remain the most popular operations. But
dermabrasion (sanding off layers of skin), breast
augmentation and liposuction (fat sucking) are coming on
strong with kids, not just with middle-aged entertainers like
Phyllis Diller. Many Asian boys and girls, overeager to
assimilate, seek to reshape the epicanthic fold in their
eyelids. Some black youths, a la Michael Jackson, see
surgeons for narrower noses and thinner lips.
   Observers critical of the phenomenon see in it pampered
children who can't tolerate the pain of being themselves.
They see a society obsessed with appearance and with
narrow-minded notions of what constitutes beauty.
   "I hear doctors defend the right of teens to have
face-lift surgery and eyelid surgery," says Frederick
Stucker, chairman of the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery
Department at Louisiana State University, "but I think we
send the wrong message when we're willing to do it for
teens." Dr. Stucker maintains that a lot of operations are
unnecessary because teenage acne, babyfat and other
"problems" usually disappear on their own as kids get older.
   Adds Norman M. Cole, vice president of the American
Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons: "A real
problem in our society is that parents want everything for
their children. Aesthetic surgery has become a commodity. `I
want my son to have a new stereo, car, nose and chin.' This
is something that deserves some careful interrogation."
Surgery to change racial characteristics, Dr. Cole says, is
"an inappropriate concession to Western images. The Oriental
eye in China is considered the most beautiful in the world.
It's a sad commentary . . ."
   Cosmetic surgeons have their own interests in the matter,
and some of them argue that plastic surgery is a real boon to
teenagers psychologically. Insecurity, self-consciousness and
a lack of self-esteem vanish once the bandages come off.
Surgery can take "years off a psychiatrist's couch," says
Walter Berman, a facial plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills,
Calif.
   "I did two kids {a 14-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy}
this week who had a hereditary bagging of the upper eyelid,"
says Lori Hansen, a plastic surgeon in Oklahoma City, Okla.
"It made them look tired all the time. So we just took the
extra skin and fat away. Things are so easily fixed now. We
don't have to live with them."
   But critics say that in many cases parents are to blame
for wanting "perfectlooking" children, thus encouraging low
self-esteem in their offspring. "We see it often," says
Pearlman D. Hicks, a plastic surgeon in Long Beach, Calif.
"The parent tells the kid, `Your nose looks terrible. You
don't even look like part of the family.' {Parents} plant the
seed and get the kids worried."
   Nose jobs, of course, are nothing new for teen-agers. But
they once were a thing of the affluent and the disfigured.
Now, middle-class people get them almost willy-nilly. They
are a socially acceptable midcourse correction in the life of
an adolescent. New procedures, like liposuction, have been
introduced in the U.S. within the past 10 years and pull in a
lot of patients.
   Many teen-agers who have had cosmetic surgery say they are
glad they did. Why put it off and prolong the agony when they
are likely to have it done eventually anyway?
   "My mom had the same problem. She had something done about
it. I could have waited years, but I did it now," says
Abigail Clawson, 15, speaking of her nose and chin jobs last
April. Abigail, of Westlake Village, Calif., had a bump on
her nose and a receding chin. Nobody ever teased her about
her profile, but for some children, ridicule from schoolmates
can be merciless: "Is that your nose or a banana?" the kids
in Hartshorne, Okla., used to taunt Amanda Andrews, 13. For
years, Amanda would come home from school weeping.
   Explains Lorraine Hollis, Amanda's grandmother and legal
guardian: "She had a great big snoot that slumped down -- and
a little, pointed chin. It gave her a witchy look." Ms.
Hollis took Amanda in for rhinoplasty (nose surgery) and
mentoplasty (a chin implant) on her 13th birthday a year ago
this month. Now, Amanda says, "I'm happier. A lot more guys
ask me out. Even those who teased me now say, `You're looking
better.'"
   Kristina Olson, 20, of Indianapolis, used to hate to go to
school because her "Dumbo" ears, as she refers to them, stuck
out. "I couldn't enjoy life," says Kristina, who would sit in
the back of the classroom and hold her hand over one ear
while covering the other with her hair.
   Finally, her mother took her in for otoplasty -- which, in
effect, pins back protruding ears -- as a gift of "happiness
and mental health." At the age of 16, Kristina entered a new
school and "no one knew the history of my ears." Her
self-esteem and self-confidence soared.
   One young black woman, who doesn't want her name
mentioned, thought her nose was too wide. While she didn't
want to change all her racial features, the 19-year-old
thought a smaller, narrower nose would "enhance" her beauty.
   So, after white friends of hers had had rhinoplasties done
and her own father had the surgery, the Los Angeles resident,
now 21, decided to narrow her nose, too. "I don't think I'm
trying to be white," although she realizes that "a lot of
people see it that way."
   Leigh Kane, of Glen Cove, N.Y., the boy who had the nose
job at 17, says he hadn't realized his nose was out of the
ordinary until his mother told him so two years ago. "I
thought she was kidding. {She said} she noticed that it was
getting progressively worse as I got older," says Leigh, now
19. Suddenly self-conscious, Leigh had a surgeon remove a
bump on his nose and fashion a new tip. And now he feels
better about himself.
   Despite the anecdotal evidence from satisfied young
clients, medical professionals worry that youngsters aren't
prepared to cope with the perils -- physical and
psychological -- of cosmetic surgery.
   "I think the psychological risk among teens is
significantly higher than it is among {the} more mature,"
says Dr. Cole. Often, teen-agers and their parents have
unrealistic expectations that changing appearance will solve
deep-seated problems that require psychiatric attention not
cosmetic surgery.
   Dr. Cole says that several years ago he performed
rhinoplasty on a 16-year-old girl who was ecstatic with the
results at first but later returned complaining that the nose
job hadn't done the trick. She couldn't, however, articulate
exactly what was bothering her. "I think psychologically . .
. that nose wasn't the problem," he says.
   Since most surgical procedures are irreversible, operating
on teen-agers is a heavy responsibility. Patients are
routinely told that things can't be put back the way they
were after the surgery has been done. Patients are counseled
extensively before surgery, so they know the risks involved.
In most states, an 18-year-old can get plastic surgery
without parental consent. Still, some young patients and
their families have regrets.
   Dr. Cole says a colleague operated on the eyelids of an
18-year-old youngster of Korean ancestry who panicked because
his grandparents were angry. "The family was insulted," Dr.
Cole says. They felt that, in having the surgery, the young
man was rejecting his culture. He went back in desperation
seeking to have the surgery undone, but of course it wasn't
possible.
   Doctors say that to be unhappy with one's physical
appearance is simply a part of being a teen-ager, and that
maturity can be the cure. Michael Seifert, 14, of Los
Angeles, has a bump on his nose and a father who is a plastic
surgeon. The son wanted surgery. The father refused on the
grounds that Michael is too young.
   Lately, Michael has found a new girlfriend, who thinks the
bump on his nose gives him "character." He no longer wants to
go under the knife.

<HL> Men, Too, Wrestle With Career-Family Stress --- Few Firms Offer Working Father Much Support </HL>

<TEXT>
   Like women before them, many men are learning that being a good parent and having a demanding career are often mutually exclusive. 

   With women working outside the home in record numbers, men are feeling increased pressure to spend more time with their children and to help around the house. 
Employers, however, generally haven't made it easy for them to do so. 
The result is that today's working fathers are feeling the anxieties that have plagued working mothers for years. 

   "Stress," says Bradley Googins, an associate professor at the Boston University School of Social Work, "is becoming more equitable." 

   This may seem odd at a time when more companies are offering flexible work schedules, parental leaves, child-care help and other assistance to working parents. 
But the reality is that women are usually the primary targets, because they tend to have more responsibility for family matters. 
"When you say 'work/family,' it's a euphemism for child care and women," says Ellen Galinsky, director of family-life studies at Bank Street College of Education, a New York research group. 

   A Boston University survey of 1,600 employees at a large public utility and a big high-technology company in the Northeast found that only 11% were part of the "traditional work force" -- that is, married males with wives at home full time. 
The survey, conducted last year by Mr. Googins and Dianne Burden, who was then an associate professor at the school, also found that almost as many fathers as mothers -- 36% vs. 37% -- reported feeling "a lot of stress" in balancing their work and family lives. 

   Overall, working mothers usually lead in the stress sweepstakes. 
The Boston University survey, like others before it, found that the total time spent on combined job and family demands is "considerably greater" for women than for men. 
When asked the extent to which they felt stress in balancing work and family duties, only mothers reported "extreme stress." 

   But one specific area where men experience more stress than women is when child-care duties force them to miss work, says Marybeth Schinn, an associate professor of psychology at New York University. 
Her research shows that in such situations men are more likely to report psychological and health problems, including headaches, bad moods and dissatisfaction with their jobs or families. 

   Of course, there are still plenty of men whose careers always come first, who are too busy, indifferent or tradition-bound to share housework and child-care responsibilities. 
But for many two-career couples, "the two big issues are who's going to do the parenting and whose job is more important," says Patricia Libbey, director of Work and Family Resources, a research and consulting group in Afton, Minn. 
"One or the other question is constant: Who should work overtime? 
Who should take on more travel? 
Who should go to night school this year?" 

   Ms. Libbey's survey last year of 1,200 employees at a big Minneapolis company found that more than 70% of fathers under age 35 had serious concerns about problems they were having managing work and family conflicts with their spouses. 
Some 60% of the men said family concerns were affecting their work goals and plans, noting that they were often not seeking promotions and transfers because they needed to spend more time with their families. 

   There are companies with innovative programs, such as child-rearing leaves and parenting seminars, that reach out to fathers as well as mothers. 
For the most part, though, corporate America, buffeted by economic pressures and commanded largely by a generation of men with traditional families, hasn't made many genuine accommodations for male employees. 

   "The workplace hasn't changed significantly," says Boston University's Mr. Googins. 
"The norms are for men that 'If I assume some of this role, not only will my career be impacted but I'm going to be seen as sort of a funny guy.'" 

   Some business owners maintain that men don't want special benefits, such as long unpaid leaves after the birth of a baby, because they can't do without the money or because they feel that child rearing is largely the mother's domain. 
"Let's face it: Men don't, by and large, have the natural interest in caring for a tiny baby," contends Cynthia Grantz, president of Rockford Coatings Corp. in Rockford, Ill. 

   Ms. Grantz and other small-business owners fought strenuously to defeat an effort in Congress this year to establish a national policy on unpaid parental leaves. 
Ms. Grantz argued, among other things, that such a policy would ultimately result in paid leave, which would prove too enticing for most employees to resist. 

   "You have to give up something to have children," says Rodney Fischer, the 44-year-old president of Curlew Homes, a Florida home-building concern. 
Noting that he puts in a seven-day work week, he says he doesn't think a company should have to do such things as give leaves to fathers for childbirth. 
"If you're working for someone," he says, "you work for them." 

   Partly because of the prevalence of such attitudes, men typically aren't heavy users of parental benefits at the companies that do have them. 
For example, Commonwealth Edison Co., a Chicago-based utility whose 18,000-employee work force is 80% male, offers up to six months' unpaid leave for child-rearing, education and other purposes. 
Since 1985, 300 women and only 25 men have applied for the child-care leave. 

   More than a third of 384 big companies surveyed in 1986 by Catalyst, a New York research group, offered unpaid leave time to fathers -- but only nine of the companies reported that men took advantage of the policy. 
In fact, the group's report noted that almost two-thirds of the companies "did not consider it reasonable for men to take any parental leave whatsoever." 
Even among those with leave policies, 41% didn't sanction men using them. 
"If a man requested a leave for this purpose, his career would take a dive," a human-resources manager at a big Southern manufacturer told Catalyst interviewers. 

   Some specialists think that findings like Catalyst's are misleading, and that many men use vacation and sick days to take short amounts of time off without calling it paternity leave. 
A study last year by Joseph Pleck, who teaches family issues at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., found that husbands in more than half of 40 families took an average of 7.5 work days off after the birth of their last child. 

   Status differences at work may also play a role. 
"Men in management and higher-paid jobs have more freedom to act in accordance with changing awareness," says James Levine, director of the Fatherhood Project at Bank Street College. 

   Despite the tensions, working fathers are finding new ways to fill their two roles. 
Most nights, Chris Kerns, a 41-year-old lawyer at the Washington, D.C., law firm McNeily &amp; Rosenfeld, picks up the youngest of his three sons from a day-care center, goes home and eats dinner with his family, and then heads back to work -- often until 2 a.m or later. 
Though his life is busy, "it feels good," he says, adding that his boys "probably get more of me." 

   While the short-term outlook for relief is bleak, researchers say, it should brighten as working parents continue to flood a tightening labor force. 
Besides, notes Bob Levey, a 43-year-old Washington Post columnist with two children, "there's a new generation coming into management."

FAMILY LIFE: WOMEN SPEAK OUT FOR ABORTION RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They range in age from 22 to 78, married, single, divorced, from San Clemente 
to La Habra and everywhere in between. Some are mothers; others aren't. But 
they have some common bonds: Most have had abortions. All have been touched by 
the issue. And with only two exceptions, they believe abortion should remain 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
We don't pretend that our sampling is a scientific one; it isn't. We simply 
asked Family Life readers who have had abortions how they now feel about the 
decision. And we asked all of our readers to speak out on the issue as it 
affects them personally. 
</P>
<P>
The response was overwhelmingly lopsided in favor of abortion, surprising 
considering Orange County's reputation for conservatism in most matters. As a 
county, we may have been strongly behind George Bush in the 1988 presidential 
election, but if these letters are any indication, we tend to disagree with the 
41st President's anti-abortion stand. 
</P>
<P>
"To start off, I've had about a dozen friends who have had legal abortions," 
writes Christina, 22, of Newport Beach. "Some of these friends have even had 
two. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just recently had an abortion, and I'm not proud of it. It's a very 
dramatic experience for any girl or woman to go through. I was lucky because 
the place I went was very private. . . . The people were very considerate and 
nice to me. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my friends went to a clinic where they had to wait 3 hours before the 
operation. They also had to wait in a large room, in paper gowns, with a dozen 
other girls. And this was a legal clinic! I couldn't imagine what clinics would 
be like if abortions became illegal! I don't regret my decision because I 
didn't have a choice in my situation. I'm only 22 years old and the father is 
just a good friend. I have too many future plans to stop and have a child right 
now, and also I couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see the point in (outlawing) abortions. What people don't seem to 
understand is that some girls will have to have them either way, and if they 
have to go to some quack of a doctor to get it done, they will. It will be 
twice as expensive and extremely dangerous. And I feel that instead of killing 
an embryo or whatever it really is, the lives of young girls and women will be 
at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Trina, who lives in Fountain Valley, doesn't have to imagine what it would be 
like if abortion was illegal. She can remember. 
</P>
<P>
"The year was 1969. I was 33, housewife and mother of four. We had a car, a 
camper and six dogs. Life was looking up. My family was complete. I was using 
an IUD." 
</P>
<P>
Trina said she was upset when she found out that she was pregnant. "I didn't 
want another baby." After her doctor ordered an X-ray to see if the IUD was 
still in place (it was), she was sure he would do an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Nope. After all, it was conservative Orange County. But if I was willing to go 
through a psychiatric evaluation up north. . . . I was distraught, depressed 
and despondent, but I wasn't about to subject myself to a psych evaluation. So 
my doctor wrote a phone number on a piece of paper and wished me luck. It was 
the Clergy Counseling Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Much to my surprise and relief, my own minister was the local counselor, and 
he quickly set me up with . . . a clinic in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest was like a cheap cloak-and-dagger story. Get cash. Set up 
appointment. Fly to Mexico City (by myself, hubby had to baby-sit while mom 
'vacationed'). Call another number. Wait in front of hotel in cold gray dawn 
for a blue car. Have procedure. Go sightseeing with another woman I met at the 
clinic. Stash medication in bra for trip home. Make appointment for husband to 
have vasectomy. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never much thought about the rightness of this issue. This was a 
mass of cells that needed to be removed. . . . And I have always felt that 
viable life was that which could survive independent of the mother. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In the intervening years I have had no regrets. I have worked as a nurse for 
the past 13 years and continue to support freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I work with families where grandmothers are raising the babies of their 
teen-age daughters. I report several cases of child abuse a month. I see the 
overcrowded conditions at the Orangewood (Children's)Home. . . . I read the 
statistics on teen-age pregnancy and child abuse. The world is full of unwanted 
babies. The pain they and their families and those who work with them suffer is 
far greater than what some would say is suffered by an aborted fetus." 
</P>
<P>
"No one, not even pro-choice advocates, are 'for' abortion," writes an 
anonymous 36-year-old woman. "Nobody likes it." 
</P>
<P>
This woman said she had an illegal abortion in Laguna Beach in 1968, when she 
was 16 and a sophomore at Corona del Mar High School. "I drove down to Laguna 
with the only two people I have ever told about my abortion, my two closest 
girlfriends. They waited in my car while I entered the dark and rather dingy 
office. No one was there except the doctor. I paid him $300. He asked me my 
name, and I gave him a phony one. I was frightened to death. . . . And abortion 
was illegal, so I didn't know if the police were watching him. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent the night in the bathroom of my girlfriend's house in total pain and 
fear. It was the most agonizing night of my life. It sounds so gruesome to say 
this, but I flushed the fetus down the toilet that night. The doctor had asked 
me to bring it back to him, but I could not bear to even look at it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Do I regret having that abortion? No way. When it was all over, I had never 
felt such feelings of relief. I had been given another chance at life! I was 
able to go on to college, to travel extensively, to fall in love with a 
wonderful man. I lived the life I had dreamed of for myself, not a life I was 
condemned to follow because of a terrible mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Another anonymous voice, from La Habra: "Five years ago, when I was 25, I had a 
legal abortion. . . . I'm not sure what my life would be like now if I had not 
had a choice. I was able to finish school and become financially stable. I plan 
to begin a family in the next year. . . . I see too many unwanted, abused, 
neglected, suicidal, unhappy and emotionally disturbed children in my work as a 
psychologist to think there could be a benefit to forcing a woman to have a 
child." "I am a 78-year-old woman," writes Gloria, from Santa Ana. "I have had 
two abortions and never regretted it, nor had one minute of guilt. I also have 
raised five children. I think these pro-lifers are interfering in something 
that is none of their business." 
</P>
<P>
And, from Kay of Fountain Valley: "I have never had an abortion, but I held my 
daughter's hand during hers. Unwanted pregnancy is an unfortunate fact of life. 
Unwanted children should not be." 
</P>
<P>
Next week, we'll hear from the dissenters, including a woman who is still in 
anguish more that 11 years after her abortion.

   Only his head and shoulders were visible
above the witness box as the boy calmly told a murder trial jury
how, when he was 2 years and 10 months old, he watched as his aunt
was grabbed and thrown down by a man with a knife.
   ``I saw a knife in his case on his belt _ I thought it was a
gun,'' the boy said softly, recounting events that took place eight
years ago. ``She was, like, pulling around his shoulders and pushing
him away from her.''
   From divorce battles to child abuse cases to murder trials, child
witnesses, once rarely seen in court, are appearing regularly in
thousands of proceedings, legal and psychiatric experts said.
   Opinion varies widely on the reliability of child witnesses and
on whether the stress they suffer in a courtroom is worth the
testimony they provide. Psychiatrists cite symptoms like nightmares,
confusion and guilt in young witnesses.
   ``It's not that difficult at all to get a child to say `nay' to
questions the child was saying `yea' to a few minutes before,''
defense attorney Frank Mondano, who was involved in a child abuse
case against a Massachusetts day care center, said of
cross-examining children.
   ``You don't know whether they are with you or in a childlike
world.''
   Prosecutors said the testimony of the 11-year-old boy in
Middlesex Superior Court last month was critical in the murder case
against William Brown, who was accused of stabbing the boy's
12-year-old aunt to death. But the boy couldn't positively identify
Brown as the attacker, the jury failed to reach a verdict, and the
case must be retried.
   Many methods have been used to smooth the road for child
witnesses. Some have been struck down as unconstitutional, others
have withstood appeals.
   In Minnesota, a child frozen with fear was permitted to testify
from beneath the prosecutor's table.
   In Philadelphia, a 5-year-old used a doll to demonstrate how her
father allegedly beat her younger sister. As a hushed courtroom
watched, the girl tossed the doll in the air. After it landed on the
floor, the girl walked down from the witness stand and began
punching it in the stomach.
   ``Where child victims used to be rare, now you're seeing many
more children coming into the system and that has required making
some accommodations,'' said Jane Walsh, a Middlesex County assistant
district attorney who has worked on many child abuse cases.
   Other changes include mandatory psychiatric evaluations before a
child is allowed to testify; special training for judges handling
child witnesses; and victim-witness advocates in prosecutors'
offices who work with families to make the experience less stressful.
   ``Children are quite honest,'' said Dr. Robert Nardone, head of
New England Medical Center's child psychology center, who frequently
evaluates potential child witnesses.
   ``If they are giving you an accurate version, they are
consistent,'' he said. ``A lot of people are concerned they are
being prepped. You usually can tell.''
   The stress associated with testifying can be especially acute
when a child is asked to give evidence against a parent or other
relative in a child abuse case, said Dr. Alayne Yates, chief of
child psychiatry at the University of Arizona.
   Problems can include ``staying awake at night, ruminating about
what they said and feeling responsible for the person being in
prison, and very sorry,'' she said.
   The younger the witness, the more acute the stress, said Yates,
adding that when she began her career in 1973 such cases were
``extraordinarily rare.''
   The number of child abuse cases nationwide has more than tripled
in a decade, according to the American Association for Protecting
Children, a Denver-based organization.
   In 1976 there were 669,000 cases but by 1986 the number jumped to
2.1 million. Of those, about 40 percent are ``substantiated'' to the
point where they may be brought to trial, said association
researcher Brandon Ruiz.
   In most of those trials, the testimony of the child victim is
required to prosecute the case.
   Judges are less willing to put children through the trauma of
testimony in divorce and custody battles than in criminal cases, but
children are often asked to take sides in a battle between parents.
Parents sometimes falsely accuse one another of sexual abuse to win
custody, Yates said.
   ``The child is liable to lose contact with a father who's a
valuable parent and sometimes whether the abuse happened or not,
they come to the feeling that it must have happened,'' she said.
