   An American tropical insect expert
faces a possible prison term in Brazil for backing native Indians
trying to stop the building of hydroelectric dams that could flood
their tribal lands in the Amazon.
   Darrell Posey, 41, a native of Henderson, Ky., who holds a Ph.D.
from the University of Georgia, has been charged by Brazil's federal
police under a law that prohibits foreigners from ``getting involved
in internal Brazilian affairs'' and ``denigrating the country's
image.'' The maximum penalty is three years in prison, followed by
expulsion.
   Authorities also have forbidden the stocky, bearded, soft-spoken
naturalist from entering certain areas inhabited by native tribes
with which he has worked since 1977. And, under the threat of
dismissal from his Brazilian government job as a professor-level
researcher for the National Research Council, Posey is barred from
leaving Brazil.
   ``The Amazon jungle is being destroyed at an a alarming rate,''
Posey recently told a group of foreign correspondents in Rio de
Janeiro. ``Meanwhile, native Indians have lived in the Amazon for
20,000 years in perfect coexistence with the environment. I'm trying
to call serious attention to the native philosophy for preserving
ecology.
   ``How can that be considered subversive?''
   Brazil traditionally has eyed the vast hydroelectric potential of
the Amazon as a way to expand its already sophisticated industrial
base, situated mostly in the southern part of the country.
   Posey irked Brazilian authorities when earlier this year he took
two chiefs of the Kayapo tribe to a seminar at the University of
Florida where they spoke against reported government hydroelectric
projects in the Amazon and then to Washington where they repeated
their views to the World Bank, which frequently helps finance such
projects.
   ``It was the first time outsiders got to hear the Indians' side
of the Amazon development story,'' Posey said. Chiefs Kube-i and
Paulinho Paiakan, wearing native headdresses and collars and jungle
body paint, addressed their U.S. hosts in Portuguese, Brazil's
official language, and Posey translated.
   In an inexplicable move, the government also indicted the
Indians, who were born in Brazil and never had been out of the
country before, for violating the Foreigners Law.
   ``The charges against the Indians have no legal basis. We'll get
the accusations thrown out,'' said Jose Carlos Castro, a lawyer in
the Amazon-delta city of Belem, where Posey is based. ``The real
purpose is to intimidate Professor Posey and make him shut up.''
   ``This is purely political,'' added Castro, who along with Kube-i
and Paiakan, also met with foreign reporters.
   ``We tried to get information about dams from our own
government,'' said Paiakan. ``But they wouldn't tell us anything.
They treated us like children. So we went to the World Bank, and it
turned out they didn't know much about these projects. Now they do.''
   Federal power officials deny claims by radical environmentalists
that they have a ``secret plan'' to build 26 hydroelectric dams
along Amazon River tributaries where Indians from 11 tribes,
including the 8,500-member Kaiapos, live, fish and hunt in
relatively untouched primitive conditions.
   Of the estimated 5 million Indians here when Portuguese explorers
discovered Brazil in 1500, only around 250,000 remain, in an
over-all population of 144 million. Anthropologists have expressed
fears about the Indians' continued survival, as hundreds of
thousands of non-Indian homesteaders, ranchers and prospectors
stream into the Amazon annually, chopping and burning away the
rainforest and ignoring demarcations of native tribal areas.
   ``There have been a lot of gossip and rumors about hydroelectric
plans in the Amazon,'' Diomedes Ferreira Jr., the spokesman for a
government Amazonian power company called Eletronorte (cq
Eletronorte), said in Brasilia, the capital. ``We have looked into
only six potential dam sites, and we're talking about projects that
wouldn't be carried out until well into the 21st century.''
   ``The government will do everything possible to protect the
environment and the Indians,'' Ferreira said.
   Meanwhile _ and without saying whether the Indians' sudden high
profile had anything to do with it _ the government says it has
shelved plans for a proposed dam known as Babaquara on the Xingu
River, a major Amazon tributary that passes through the Kayapo
lands. Its reservoir would have covered 2,300 square miles, twice
the size of Rhode Island. Brazil had intended to ask the World Bank
to finance it.
   Now, says Ferreira, the only Xingu dam under possible
consideration is one called Kararao, with a reservoir one-fifth the
size of that of Babaquara.
   The World Bank in Washington said construction of the 11
million-kilowatt Kararao installation _ nearly twice as large as
Washington's Grand Coulee Dam, the United States' biggest _ could
not begin until 1991 or 1992.
   Ferreira said, ``So far we're talking only about hydroelectric
potential feasibility studies. We're not saying Kararao will be
built. But even if it is, there wouldn't be another dam in that
region before 2010.''
   Nonetheless, a Kayapo Legal Fund, partially coordinated by Posey,
has been set up at the University of California at Berkeley, to keep
an eye on the Amazon dam situation.
   The Kayapos plan to call a multitribal meeting of up to 5,000
Indians in late January to discuss the overall problem of Amazon
development projects.
   ``The Indians are serious,'' said Posey. ``The problem is that
hardly anyone takes them seriously _ and they have so much to teach
us.''

<HEAD>Court Suspends Trial Of Indians And American</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has suspended the trial of
two Indian chiefs and a American who were charged with criticizing
Brazil during a trip to the United States, an official said
Wednesday.
   Federal Judge Milton Luiz Pereira on Tuesday halted the trial of
American Darrell Posey and chiefs Kube-I and Paulo Paiakan because
of ``unsound accusations and a lack of just cause,'' Claudia de
Oliveira, an official in the Federal Appeals Court, said by
telephone from Brasilia.
   Kube-I and Paiakan, both of the Kayapo tribe, and Posey, 41, a
native of Henderson, Ky., and an expert on tropical insects, were
accused of breaking Brazil's foreigners law during a trip last year
to the United States, where they denounced the white man's
encroachment upon Indian lands in Brazil.
   Brazilian law prohibits foreigners from making political
statements or interfering in the country's legal affairs.
   The trial caused a sensation in Brazil because it marked the
first time native Indians had been legally considered foreigners.
Legally, Brazil's 220,000 Indians are wards of the state and do not
have the full rights of other citizens.
   Pereira ordered the trial suspended because Kube-I and Paiakan
were found to be ``native Brazilians recognized by the federal
constitution'' and because Posey, a Brazil resident, proved he had
acted solely as a language interpreter when the remarks were made,
de Oliveira said.
   The court's action appeared to be an attempt by the government to
back off the controversial case. De Oliveira would not comment on
why the judge suspended the trial instead of simply throwing the
charges out.
   He said the proceedings could be renewed but the possibility of
that was ``very, very unlikely.''
   The trial began in August in Belem, capital of the northern
Amazon jungle state of Para.
   The Brazilian government charged the Kayapo chiefs and Posey with
illegal political activities after they spoke at Miami's Florida
International University about forest conservation. Posey said he
attended the forum as a friend and interpreter for the chiefs.
   Soon after the forum, environmental groups invited Paiakan and
Kube-I to speak to the World Bank in Washington, where they
criticized deforestation in the Amazon jungle, erosion, mercury
pollution from gold mining, and the construction of hydroelectric
projects that caused flooding in low-lying jungle areas and
displaced Indian tribes.
   Later, the World Bank held back funds for the Xingu hydroelectric
project, which would have inundated an estimated 18.8 million acres
of mostly Indian land.
   Many Brazilian observers credited the Kayapo chiefs with blocking
the project.
   But Posey, also a federal researcher in the Brazilian National
Research Council, said funding had been suspended because of
financing problems with the government power company Eletronorte.

<HEAD>Amazon Tribes Join Against Dams that Would Flood Their Lands</HEAD>
<UNK>By PETER MUELLO ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>ALTAMIRA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Indians, painted for war and
representing tribes of the Amazon, began a historic effort Monday to
stop the government from building two hydroelectric dams that would
flood native lands.
   It is the first time diverse tribes from the vast Amazon rain
forest have joined in a political movement.
   ``We will bring Indian peoples together, to fight,'' said Chief
Sebirop of the Gaviao tribe. ``We will not accept the dams. Where
will we live? What will we eat?''
   He and the others oppose construction of the Kararao and
Babaquara dams on the Xingu River, a major Amazon tributary, which
would flood an estimated 3,000 square miles of rain forest and
displace 7,000 Indians.
   Thousands of pro-dam demonstrators in trucks, cars and on
horseback paraded through the streets of this remote jungle town
carrying signs reading ``The dams mean more jobs and more progress''
and ``Gringos leave us in peace.'' Airplanes with banners carrying
similar slogans buzzed overhead.
   Brazil has about 220,000 Indians in a total population of 144
million. Historians say the number has declined from about 5 million
when Portuguese explorers landed in 1500.
   Tribes along the Xingu face opposition from government and
industry, which say the power the dams would generate is vital to
economic growth.
   About 500 Indian men, women and children from more than 20 tribes
attended the opening session of the conference Monday at a brick
community center in this city of 38,000 people 2,000 miles northwest
of Rio de Janeiro.
   Included were 100 warriors from the Kayapo tribe, the main
organizer of the gathering. They ran into the center chanting,
wearing green-and-yellow feathered headdresses and daubed with red
and black war paint.
   They circled in a ritual dance, then put palm ronds on the
concrete floor and sat. Kayapo women carrying machetes, many with
young children, sat around the group.
   Whites predominated in the crowd packing the concrete bleachers
and the auditorium's balcony. They cheered and applauded as each
tribal delegation arrived.
   Brazilian and foreign environmentalists were among the onlookers.
Foreign organizations represented included the Environmental Defense
Fund, based in Washington, and Friends of the Earth, which has its
headquarters in London.
   Chiefs stepped onto a wooden platform in turn and spoke about the
dams.
   ``We want the goverment to rethink the dams, said Jorge Terena of
the Terena tribe. ``The land is sacred to us. It has the roots of
our culture and our ancestors. The electricity won't benefit
Indians, only whites and their industries.''
   David Yanomami of the primitive Yanomami tribe that recently won
a U.N. ``Global 500 '' award for defense of the environmental
defense, took the platform and declared: ``We will not accept the
dams. The river will rise. The fish will die. The game will move
away.''
   All the chiefs spoke in Portuguese, Brazil's national language,
sometimes with accents and imperfect grammar.
   Some Kayapos made a videotape of the meeting to replay for their
villages.
   The Indians invited President Jose Sarney and ranking Cabinet
ministers to the meeting, but the government sent Fernando Mesquita,
president of the Brazilian Environment Institute.
   Boos and whistles came from the crowd when Mesquita said: ``We
recognize that great indignities were committed against the Indian
people, but now it is a question of national awareness. We are here
to listen.''
   Sarney, who was out of the country Monday, has said he favors
protecting of Indians and the Amazon environment but does not want
foreigners telling him how.
   The government has temporarily shelved plans for the Babaquara
dam but is actively studying the Kararao project, which is intended
to produce 11 million kilowatts.
   Officials say work on Kararao could start in the early 1990s.
Brazil has approached the World Bank about partial financing.
   Environmentalists are trying to discourage the bank and other
international lending institutions from putting money into Third
World development projects considered harmful to the environment or
native peoples.

   A U.S. anthropologist and two
Amazon Indian chiefs were arraigned Friday on charges of engaging
in illegal political activities and could be expelled from Brazil.
   Darrell Posey, 41, of Henderson, Ky., and chiefs Paulo Paiakan
and Kube-I of the Kayapo tribe were accused of breaking Brazil's
Foreigners Law during a trip to the United States this year.
   The law, passed in 1980 when Brazil was under a military
government, prohibits non-Brazilian residents or visitors from
speaking out publicly on domestic political issues.
   The trial has caused a sensation here. It is first time native
Indians have been legally considered foreigners.
   Posey's lawyer, well-known human rights defender Jose Carlos
Castro, said Friday the trial was suspended ``at least until
December'' because Kube-I had returned to his village for the
harvest and festival period and refused to show up at court.
   The court gave Kube-I 90 days to present himself for arraignment.
   ``This is a landmark case. I've been studying native peoples for
24 years, and this is the first time a native group has been
considered foreign by a white government,'' Posey said by telephone
from his office in Belem, a city at the mouth of the Amazon River
2,140 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   He said the two Kayapo chiefs were invited by Florida
International University in Miami to speak about forest
conservation. Posey, who has lived and worked in Brazil since 1977,
said he went along as a friend and interpreter.
   ``They (the two Indians) said they were worried about
deforestation in the Amazon, erosion, mercury pollution from gold
mining, and hydroelectric projects that displace Indian tribes.
They're especially upset at the Xingu project that will inundate
about ... (18.8 million acres) of land, mostly Indian territory,''
Posey said.
   The Kayapos number about 5,500 and live in the southern Amazon
jungle.
   Environmental groups later invited Paiakan and Kube-I to speak
to the World Bank in Washington. The bank suspended funding for the
Xingu project.
   Many Brazilians believe the Indians were responsible for
blocking the project, but Posey said funding already had been
suspended because of financing problems with the government power
company Eletronorte.
   The trial began Friday in Belem at the 3rd Federal Court of
Para, a northern Amazon jungle state. If found guilty, the three
face a prison term of up to three years each and expulsion from
Brazil.
   It was not clear where the Indians could be expelled to.
   ``That's a very interesting question. But it's the government's
problem,'' Posey said.
   Legally, Indians are wards of the state and don't have the full
rights of other citizens.
   Posey said he felt the trial was an attempt by the government to
intimidate scientists and native Indians and keep them from
speaking out on politically sensitive issues.
   ``No matter what the outcome of the trial is, the effects will
be very unpleasant. I am prohibited from working in any Indian area
as long as the case is pending. My work is paralyzed,'' he said.
   The Foreigners Law was enacted and often used by the military
governments that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. Foreign priests
and students who spoke out about political affairs were charged and
sometimes expelled from the country.
   However, this is the first time the law has been used since
Brazil returned to civilian rule in 1985 under President Jose
Sarney.
   Posey said he wasn't afraid of being expelled.
   ``If I'm found guilty ... I wouldn't want to stay here any
more.''

<TEXT>
   More than 350 Amazon Indians
wearing loincloths and warpaint protested Friday outside a
courthouse where their chief appeared for a hearing on alleged
illegal political activities, a lawyer said.
   Federal Judge Iran Velasco do Nascimento canceled the hearing
because chief Kube-I appeared before the court in a loincloth,
which the judge said was disrespectful, said Kube-I's lawyer, Jose
Carlos Castro.
   Kube-I, chief Paulo Paiakan, both of the Kayapo tribe, and U.S.
anthropologist Darrell Posey of Henderson, Ky., are accused of
breaking Brazil's foreigners law, which bans foreigners from making
political statements or interfering in Brazil's internal affairs.
   During a trip to the United States earlier this year, the three
complained about the white man's encroachment upon Indian lands.
   The trial, which began in late August, has caused a sensation
because it is the first time native Indians have been legally
considered foreigners.
   At the hearing in Belem, 2,140 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro
in the northern Amazon jungle state of Para, Kube-I told the judge
that as chief of his tribe he has never worn a suit and tie and
refused to begin doing so now, Castro said.
   ``The judge then said Kube-I's decision to wear his tribal
clothes to the hearing was disrespectful and said the hearing was
no longer necessary,'' Castro said.
   Outside the courthouse, Castro said, more than 350 Kayapo
Indians in loincloths and green and yellow warpaint danced, chanted
tribal songs and shot arrows into nearby trees as they protested
the hearing. They were surrounded by heavily armed federal police
and more than 1,000 onlookers.
   Castro said he would file a petition to drop charges against the
two Kayapo chiefs on the grounds that they are Brazilian Indians
and cannot be tried as foreigners.
   Brazil's 220,000 Indians, including 5,500 Kayapos, are wards of
the state and do not enjoy the full rights accorded other citizens.
   Posey, however, said in a telephone interview that he wanted to
see the trial continue because ``if it's shelved, it could be
brought against others in our situation.
   ``This is a real aggression against myself, the Indians, the
scientific community in general and we want to see justice done.''
   Posey and the Kayapo chiefs were charged with illegal political
acitivites after they appeared at Florida International University
in Miami to speak about forest conservation.
   Later, the chiefs spoke at the World Bank in Washington, D.C.,
where they criticized the deforestation of the Amazon, erosion,
mercury pollution from gold mining, and hydroelectric projects that
displace Indian tribes.
   The World Bank later suspended funding for the Xingu
hydroelectric project, which will inundate about 18.8 million acres
of mostly Indian land.
   Many Brazilians believe the Kayapo chiefs were responsible for
blocking the project. But Posey said funding already had been
suspended because of financing problems with the government power
company Eletronorte.
   Posey, 41, an anthropologist and biologist, is an outspoken
critic of the government's Indian policy. He has lived in Brazil
since the late 1970s and already has been threatened with expulsion.

<DATELINE>ALTAMIRA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In their first joint political action,
more than 500 Indians from 20 Amazon rain forest tribes have
gathered in this jungle town to protest planned hydrolectric dams
that would flood their lands.
   Sporting green-and-yellow feathered headdresses and red and black
warpaint, about 100 warriors from the Kayapo tribe ran chanting into
a brick community center Monday in Altamira, which is 2,000 miles
northwest of Rio de Janiero.
   The tribe circled in a ritual dance, then sat to applaud as the
men, women and children of each subsequent tribe arrived for a week
of debates, speeches and other events.
   For the first time, Amazon tribes were together to discuss common
concerns.
   The Indians are protesting the proposed Kararao and Babaquara
dams on the Amazon's Xingu river. If built, the reservoirs would
flood about 3,000 square miles of jungle, displacing 7,000 of the
220,000 Indians who remain in Brazil.
   About 5 million Indians roamed the country when the Portuguese
arrived in the 1500s and ``settled'' what is now South America's
largest nation.
   Anthropologists have expressed fears about the Indians' continued
survival, as hundreds of thousands of non-Indian homesteaders,
ranchers and prospectors stream into the Amazon annually, chopping
and burning away the rain forest and ignoring demarcations of native
tribal areas.
   ``We want the government to rethink the dams,'' Jorge Terena of
the Terena tribe told a cheering crowd packed into the community
center. ``The land is sacred to us. It has the roots of our culture
and our ancestors.''
   ``We will not accept the dams,'' said David Yanomami of the
primitive Yanomami tribe. ``The river will rise. The fish will die.
The game will move away.''
   Later in the day, thousands of farmers and local shopowners
marched through Altamira, a town of 38,000, carrying placards saying
``Dams mean more jobs and more progress'' and ``Gringos leave us in
peace.''
   ``I know the Indians will have problems, but I'm in favor of the
dams,'' said Raimundo Castro Bastos, owner of an Altamira bar. ``I
believe the dams will bring development and progress for us.''
   Government and industry leaders say the energy provided by the
dams is vital for the growth of this Third World nation.
   The government representative to the meeting, Fernando Mesquita,
president of the Brazilian Environment Institute, spoke to whistles
and boos from the crowd, which included native Indian leaders from
around the world, hundreds of foreign and Brazilian
environmentalists, and droves of journalists.
   ``We recognize that great indignities were committed against the
Indian people. But now it is a question of national awareness. We
are here to listen,'' Mesquita said.
   The late December shooting death of internationally-known Amazon
ecologist Francisco Mendes, who fought against the destruction of
the rain forest by ranchers, increased international awareness of
the movement to preserve the jungle and protect its native peoples.
   Environmentalists are concerned that slash burning of the rain
forest is contributing to the warming of world temperatures and
destroying both a vital source of oxygen and an important habitat
for animal and plant life.
   The ecologists are trying to discourage foreign lending
institutions from putting money into Brazilian development projects
considered harmful to the enviroment and native peoples.
   Foreign governments and environmental groups have, for example,
proposed that Brazil swap part of its $115 billion foreign debt for
promises to preserve parcels of jungle territory.
   President Jose Sarney, for his part, has said he doesn't want any
meddling in domestic affairs by foreigners.

<TEXT>
   The foreign minister of Portugal has had
his knuckles rapped for what is usually considered an essential
skill in modern diplomacy _ speaking English.
   Newspapers and politicians have harshly criticized Joao de Deus
Pinheiro ever since he spoke English earlier this month at an
international conference on chemical weapons in Paris.
   Critics say it breaks a pledge by the seven Portuguese-speaking
nations to promote their language _ the sixth most widely spoken in
the world _ at international events.
   More importantly, they charge Pinheiro hurt Portugal at a time
when its influence among former colonies is increasingly being
challenged by one of them _ Brazil.
   ``No speak Portuguese,'' was the motto plastered across the
T-shirt of a cartoon of Deus Pinheiro on the cover of the satirical,
right-wing weekly O Diabo.
   Another paper this week showed the stocky, bearded minister
introducing himself as ``God Pine'' _ the direct English translation
of his name.
   While Deus Pinheiro has been busy drumming up international
financial support for an economic recovery plan for the other major
Portuguese-speaking countries of Angola and Mozambique, Brazil has
outflanked Portugal on trade and relief efforts.
   Trade between Angola and Brazil has quadrupled the last three
years to more than $1 billion.
   Portugal's trade with Angola dropped from about $165 million in
1986 to $127 million in 1987. For the first eight months of 1988,
the countries' did about $103 million in business.
   Deus Pinheiro's recovery plan foresees $600 million dollars worth
of aid from several nations to Angola, but Brazil has already
granted Luanda a $1.1 billion credit that the African nation repays
in oil it produces.
   According to one government official in Brasilia, next week's
planned visit by President Jose Sarney to Angola, the first ever by
a Brazilian head of state, should increase cooperation between the
countries.
   Brazil already sells food, cars, and farm machinery to the
southern African nation and is helping to build a hydroelectric dam
there. Brazilian companies are now showing interest in helping
rebuild Angola's ravaged telephone and power networks.
   ``We think Portugal made an error (at the Paris conference),''
said Mozambique's secretary of state for foreign affairs, Antonio
Materrula. ``We have to push our mutual language at an international
level.''
   Portuguese is not an official language of the United Nations, but
the countries that use it _ Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde,
Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal and Sao Tome e Principe _ count
about 180 million inhabitants.
   Only Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, English, Spanish and Russian are
spoken by more people worldwide.
   Brazilian and Mozambican delegates at the chemical weapons
conference spoke in Portuguese, further enraging Portugal's
politicians, scholars and journalists.
   ``It's a scandalous insult to the values and interests of our
language,'' said Herminio Martinho, leader of Portugal's New
Democratic Party.
   ``The importance of this language should be turned into a
diplomatic tool _and we (Portugal) don't have many others,'' said
Jorge Sampaio, newly elected leader of Portugal's main opposition
Socialist Party.

   Chiefs of Amazon Indian tribes ended a
historic meeting Friday with a demand to stop plans to build a
hydroelectric dam that would flood native lands.
   Hundreds of Indians, wearing colored feathers, beads and red and
black paint, stood and chanted their support as Indian leader Ailton
Krenac read an appeal to protect Amazonia, home to most of Brazil's
220,000 native people.
   ``We do not want the construction of dams on the Xingu River and
on other rivers in the Amazon, because they threaten Indian
nations,'' he said. The mostly white audience of townspeople and
representatives of environmental groups cheered and applauded.
   More than 500 Indians from about 40 native groups met for five
days in this eastern Amazon city, 2,000 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro, to protest the proposed Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu River,
an Amazon tributary. It was the first time Indians in Brazil set
aside longstanding tribal rivalries and banded together in a
political movement.
   The reservoir of the $5.8 billion dam would flood 500 square
miles of rain forest. The dam would have a generating capacity of 11
million kilowatts _ 40 percent more than that of Grand Coulee, the
biggest hydroelectric dam in the United States.
   ``For a long time, the white man has ignored our thinking and the
spirit of our ancestors. Now this must stop. Our territory is the
sacred site of our people, the home of our creator that cannot be
violated,'' Krenac said.
   The government contends Brazil must tap the vast hydroelectric
potential of the Amazon basin to progress. Federal electric power
officials at the gathering told the Indians that dams will be built.
Earlier in the week, one Indian woman thrust a machete just inches
from the face of an electricity company representative. Other tribal
people said that was merely a symbolic gesture.
   Congressman Tadeu Franca, pledged to carry on the Indians' fight
in Brasilia, the capital. ``Because of this meeting, it will be
Indians, working together _ not some presidential decree _ that will
build the Indians' history,'' he said.
   ``Nothing like this has ever happened before. The Indians will go
back to their villages with the sense that something really new and
important has happened,'' said Terry Turner, a U.S. anthropologist
who has worked more than 20 years with the Kayapo Indians.
   Construction of the dam is scheduled to start in 1993. It must
first be approved by Congress.
   Brazil has shown interest in getting partial financing for the
project from the World Bank, but Indians and environmental groups
are asking the Washington-based institution not to put up any money.
   In a small victory this week, the Indians won an agreement from
the government electric power company in Amazonia to change the name
of the project to Belo Monte from Kararao. Kararao is a war cry of
the Kayapo tribe and was offensive to other tribes.

   Angry Amazon Indians thrust lances and
machetes at government electric power officials Tuesday in a second
day of heated debate over a proposed hydroelectric dam that would
flood tribal lands.
   More than 500 Indians from 37 native groups packed the city's
community center for the historic encounter of tribes in this east
Amazon city, 2,000 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   The meeting is the first united political movement by the native
tribes, and seeks to block construction of the Kararao dam on the
Xingu River, an Amazon tributary. Brazil says the energy is vital
for development in this land of 144 million people.
   Tempers flared when Jose Lopes, engineering director for
Eletronorte, the government Amazon power company, told the Indians
the dam would not raise the river beyond its present level.
   ``You're lying! Everything you say is a lie!'' shouted Tuira, a
Kayapo Indian woman as she strode through the crowd and brandished a
machete in Lopes' face.
   Her words in Kayapo were translated into broken Portuguese by
Chief Paulo Paiakan. He said her gesture is ``one of our traditions,
it does not mean war.''
   Kayapo warrior Uh-Te also protested angrily and repeatedly thrust
a red-feathered lance at the company offical.
   ``We don't know what energy means. I was raised on game, fish and
wild honey in the forest. Why didn't you consult us about the dam?''
said Uh-Te with Paiakan translating.
   The Indians, some wearing a green-and-yellow feathered headresses
and black warpaint on their faces and bodies, raised their war clubs
in a sign of agreement.
   Lopes said Eletronorte was preparing an environmental impact
report on the Kararao project. ``If the dam affects Indian land, it
must be approved by congress,'' he said.
   Brazil's Indian population has been decimated by development
projects such as hydroelectric dams and the Trans-Amazon highway.
There are about 220,000 Indians left in Brazil, down from an
estimated 5 million when the country was discovered by Portuguese
explorers in 1500.
   ``The dam is not a reality until construction starts,'' and that
won't happen for at least five years,'' Lopes said. He said
Eletronorte has scrapped plans for other contested Amazon dams at
Babaquara and Iriri.
   Chief Paiakan also complained that Indians had not been consulted
about the name of the dam. Kararao is a Kayapo war cry, he said.
``To our youths, the government is calling us to war,'' Paiakan said.
   Lopes promised the project would be given a ``white name.''
   Earlier in Brasilia, Interior Minister Joao Alves said the
government would not consider stopping the Kararao project. He said
the dam was fundamental for Brazil's future and would dislocate only
about 280 Indians.
   Kararao will generate 11 million kilowatts of electricity, Alves
said _ second only to the Itaipu dam, the world's largest, located
on Brazil's southwestern border with Paraguay.
   Brazilian and international environmental groups attending the
five-day meeting said the Kararao project was probably unstoppable.
   ``I don't think it's likely they'll stop construction of Kararao.
But that doesn't mean the meeting is a waste,'' said Barbara
Bramble, a director of the Washington-based National Wildlife Fund.
   ``This could be a real milestone in the formation of alliances
among Amazonian peoples to work together to save the place they live
in.''
   Joining the protesters was British rock star Sting, who told the
Amazon Indian chiefs he was starting an international campaign to
raise money to create a huge Amazon National Park. He said the
campaign would begin April 12 in Paris.
   ``I'm not here on behalf of one people. If the rain forest dies
all of us are in danger,'' Sting said.
   He said he got permission for his project from President Jose
Sarney.

  [Text] Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and 
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Durao Barroso have signed a 
memorandum of understanding whose main point involves the 
recognition of professions in the two countries. 
  The recognition of diplomas will be studied by the 
professional associations of the two countries. If no agreement 
is reached, the governments intend to draft specific legislation 
that will ensure the validity of registries. 
  Minister Celso Amorim noted that it will now be up to the 
Portuguese institutions to discuss the situation of these 
professionals. He noted that the agreement applies to 
professions such as attorneys-at-law, doctors, and architects. 
  The two ministers also signed an agreement that guarantees 
the promotion and protection of investments between the 
governments of Brazil and Portugal. 
  Foreign Minister Durao Barroso believes that this also 
represents a great opening for Brazil to negotiate with other 
European nations.

   A campaign to preserve the remaining half of the
world's tropical rain forests has finally taken root, but the task
is enormous and the last gasp for the ``lungs of the Earth'' could
be less than a century away.
   Environmentalists are pleased with their initial success three
years after they began challenging governments, industries and
banks. But an area the size of a soccer field is destroyed each
minute, and the young preservation movement seeks fundamental
changes in political, economic and social structures to save the
teeming jungles of South America, Africa and Southeast Asia.
   An aggressive campaign of publicity, education and confrontation
began in 1985 and appeared to capture the world's attention last
year. Almost overnight, it seemed, world leaders began calling for
greater efforts to halt the chopping and burning of rain forests.
Conferences discussed such technical conservation issues as
``sustainable management.'' Rock stars Sting and The Grateful Dead
played benefit concerts for the cause. Media coverage increased.
   Some recent fruits of that effort:
   _Brazil in October announced suspension of tax benefits for
landowners who destroy the Amazon rain forest, the largest and
fastest-disappearing on Earth.
   _The International Tropical Timber Organization approved a $4
million project in northern Brazil that calls for loggers to consult
with environmental groups, government agencies, native Indians and
local workers to plan long-term forest development and preservation.
   _Some 500 Brazilian Indians from 20 tribes gathered last month to
oppose planned hydroelectric dams in the Amazon that could flood
rain forest areas, including their homes. The meeting was the first
by the tribes, which traditionally have battled over territory and
remained isolated.
   _Thailand imposed a nationwide logging ban after
environmentalists blamed uncontrolled timber harvesting for floods
that killed more than 350 people in November. Last April, officials
suspended plans for a hydroelectric dam that environmentalists said
would have ruined Thailand's last virgin rain forest.
   _West Germany earmarked about $80 million for saving tropical
forests.
   ``Without a coherent strategy for protecting the tropical forests
in which everyone concerned participates, we cannot master the vast
problems threatening the future of all mankind,'' said West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   ``We have to be ambitious. We're in trouble,'' said Randall
Hayes, head of the U.S.-based Rainforest Action Network. ``If we
don't get the changes we need in the next five years, then we've
lost the rain forests.''
   The results could be catastrophic.
   Rain forests cover some 2.4 billion acres of the planet, about
half the original amount, ecologists say.
   Sometimes called the ``lungs of the Earth,'' they act as a
pollution filter, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. If
carbon dioxide isn't removed from the atmosphere, it can trap heat,
which some scientists say causes a global warming trend called the
greenhouse effect. Burning the rain forests, a common way to create
arable land, also adds carbon to the atmosphere.
   Rain forests are storehouses of plant, insect and animal species,
some of which could prove useful for drugs and other scientific
endeavors. Scientists say only a small percentage of the 5 million
species in the forests, many of them unique to the tropical
environment, have been studied.
   In addition, 200 million people live in and around rain forests,
including indigenous tribes who depend on them for sustenance and
shelter.
   Nonetheless, preservation presents complexities that cut across
social and political boundaries. Many rain forests are in developing
countries that need to capitalize on their natural resources and
must borrow money for costly modernization projects, such as
highways and power plants.
   Brazil, for example, has the developing world's largest foreign
debt at $115 billion. Two of its limited number of export products
are beef and timber _industries that cause major forest destruction.
Cattle ranchers burn forests to create grazing land; loggers clear
jungle in search of exotic hardwoods.
   Meanwhile, poor farmers burn small tracts to grow crops. The
soil, so fertile under the rain forest canopy, is then leached of
nutrients in seasonal heavy rains, forcing farmers to move on and
burn another patch every few years.
   Last fall, Brazilian President Jose Sarney suspended tax benefits
for land developers and banned exports of unprocessed tropical
timber. ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all
passengers in the adventure of man on Earth. The era of unlimited
natural resources is over,'' he said.
   But environmentalists contend the harmful practices continue.
Now, Brazil is balking at proposals to swap some of its foreign debt
for saving parcels of rain forest. Such plans would entail creation
of an international commission to watch over the preserved jungle.
   ``We can't turn the Amazon into a sort of national park for
humanity,'' Brazil's foreign minister, Roberto de Abreu Sodre, said.
``Our priority is economic development. We're open to international
suggestions, but not those that interfere in Brazilian sovereignty.''
   Industrial giants such as the United States and European
countries, which have little or no rain forest, have been the most
vocal about the developing nations' efforts to halt the destruction.
That causes particular resentment.
   A conference of eight nations in the Amazon region, including
Brazil, earlier this month issued a declaration rejecting foreign
interference while saying development must preserve the environment
and wild resources.
   ``Part of the problem is that it's coming down to the developed
countries versus the developing countries,'' said a U.S. activist
who monitors the World Bank, the largest source of aid to developing
nations.
   ``They (developing countries) say, `You raped your countries to
get developed, and now you're stopping us from doing it,''' said the
activist, who spoke on condition his name not be used.
   But N.F. Potter, Canada's executive director at the 151-nation
World Bank, said: ``There are ways of doing things without making
the same mistakes.''
   The World Bank has been criticized by environmentalists, who say
it ignores ecological issues when funding projects. At issue are
billions of dollars; in the fiscal year ending June 30, the bank
expects to loan a record $21 billion.
   ``These bankers are unbelievably ignorant. They are absolutely
reckless,'' said Brent Blackwelder of the U.S.-based Environmental
Policy Institute.
   Under increasing pressure from member nations and environmental
groups not to fund ecologically harmful projects, the bank set up a
department in 1987 to assess the potential damage of development
projects.
   ``You can see a lot more environmental consciousness than there
was two years ago,'' said an official with a U.S. agency that
monitors aid. ``There has been movement. I'm not saying there has
been all the movement necessary.''

  [Text] The Portuguese-speaking countries community probably 
will be created before July. The foreign ministers of the seven 
Portuguese-speaking countries -- Brazil, Portugal, Angola, 
Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, and Cape Verde 
-- today signed a joint communique as the basis for the 
establishment of the community of Portuguese-speaking countries. 
The document has 13 points that are fundamental for the group's 
implementation. The main items are: social, cultural, and 
economic cooperation among the countries' inhabitants; the 
implementation in the short term of the Portuguese Language 
International Institute; and support for an immediate cease-fire 
in Angola, where a civil war is under way. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said the community 
will be a great opportunity to intensify relations among the 
member countries. He added that it will not prevent them from 
participating in other groups: 
  [Begin recording] Brazil, for example, which is currently a 
UN Security Council member, has been acting in coordination with 
other countries. It is necessary, however, to make this 
coordination and common agreement more permanent then it is in 
other forums. In Latin America, for example, we participate in 
the Rio Group. Portugal is a EC member. The African 
Portuguese-speaking countries are OAU members. Therefore, this 
association will allow us to make better use of our common 
efforts. [end recording] 
  The community of Portuguese-speaking countries will be 
comprised of more than 200 million people spread over three 
continents. In addition to the language, these peoples share 
historic and ethnic traits. The community will become official 
during a meeting of the member countries' chiefs of state, which 
probably will be held in Lisbon before July.

  [Text] Brasilia -- A group headed by Ambassador Roberto 
Abdenur, secretary general of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, 
will visit Washington in early February to try to prevent the 
United States from retaliating against Brazil, which will 
probably not be able to meet the 28 February deadline to approve 
a bill on industrial property rights (trademarks and patents). 
  The fatal deadline imposed by the United States is already 
the extension of an investigation into Brazilian industrial 
property law. Last November the U.S. Government decided to 
bring forward by three months its decision on whether to adopt 
restrictive measures on Brazilian exports. 
  This subject was discussed yesterday by Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim and 20 businessmen from the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce. The minister does not think there will be 
difficulties in the talks with the United States, because the 
Brazilian draft bill being discussed in Congress "will be very 
similar to the intellectual property agreement" of the Uruguay 
Round of GATT talks which concluded last 15 December. 
  "An action that does not take into consideration what was 
attained bilaterally and multilaterally would be technically 
precipitate and politically inopportune. If Brazil had wanted 
to, it would have hindered the GATT intellectual property 
agreement," Amorim said. 
  The main point of controversy in the Brazilian draft bill is 
the requirement that pharmaceutical products must be 
manufactured in Brazil in order to obtain a license. The text 
of the GATT agreement on the subject is ambiguous, and has not 
yet been clarified within the Paris Convention which deals with 
intellectual property rights. "The text of the agreement deals 
with the subject indirectly. Political vision is necessary to 
deal with this ambiguity, which will in time be resolved," Celso 
Amorim said. 
  The foreign minister also spoke with the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce businessmen about the Common Market of the South, the 
Uruguay Round of the GATT talks, and trade problems between 
Brazil and the United States, such as problems in the iron and 
steel industry and in the shoe and tobacco sectors.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of gold prospectors in the
Amazon are devastating rain forests and killing off the world's
largest primitive Indian tribe, a panel of officials, scientists and
clerics said Wednesday.
   Indian reservations are being ``physically, morally and
culturally destroyed'' by uncontrolled gold mining and settlement in
the region, said ``Action for the Citizens.''
   It is the first time government officials have spoken against
destruction of the Yanomami Indian tribe and the rain forest by gold
miners. In this nation where the frontier spirit is strong and
rugged prospectors are widely seen as folk heroes, the government
has rarely intervened.
   The commission of Justice Ministry officials, lawmakers, lawyers,
scientists, Roman Catholic Church members and missionaries said
whites disrupted Indian hunting, contaminated rivers with mercury
used to join gold dust particles and spread fatal diseases among the
Indian population.
   The Yanomamis are a tribe of about 9,000 in the far northern
states of Amazonas and Roraima, near the Venezuelan border. The area
is rich in timber, gold, diamonds and other minerals and has been
invaded by an estimated 100,000 prospectors, despite a government
ban prohibiting whites from entering Indian reservations.
   ``Owing to the tolerance of the authorities before an invasion of
thousands of gold miners into the reserves, we are seeing the
genocide of the Yanomani Indians, devastation of nature,
contamination of rivers and a gigantic ecological disaster,'' Sen.
Severo Gomes of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party
said in an interview.
   Gomes had joined House member Plinio Arruda Sampaio of the
leftist Workers' Party, Archbishop Aldo Mongiano and 15 other
members in a recent three-day trip to several Yanomami reservations
in the far-off jungle state of Roraima, some 3,720 miles northwest
of Rio de Janeiro.
   The delegation also visited territories of the Macuxi, Wapixana,
Ingarico, and Taurepang tribes, which have been invaded by ranchers
that burned off and cleared indigenous farmland.
   The 26-page report denounced a ``complete disregard for the law''
by the miners and the lack of government enforcement in the region,
which it said even led to contrabanding of gold.
   All gold is required by law to be sold to the government.
   ``The miners themselves, with their guns, resolve all legal
problems,'' said Senator Gomes.
   Prospectors illegally used jungle airstrips cut by the Brazilian
Air Force ``every five minutes'' to transport cargo and manpower by
helicopter and planes, said Sampaio.
   ``The whole thing looks like Vietnam during the war,'' he said.
``The hellish noise of planes and helicopters sends the Indians
scattering.''
   Last year, the powerful Bishops Council of the Roman Catholic
Church warned that the Yanomamis faced extinction if their lands
were taken away. The council said the government reduced by 70
percent the tribe's 17.3 million acres of land, divided into 19
separate tracts.
   About 220,000 Indians are left in Brazil, down from an estimated
5 million when the country was discovered by the Portuguese in 1500.

marched on the presidential palace Thursday to demand the removal of
tens of thousands of gold miners who invaded tribal lands.
   Shouting ``Give back the stolen land!'' and ``We want peace, not
war!'' about 100 Indians of the Yanomami, Kayapo, Guarani and
Kaingang tribes advanced to the marble-and-glass palace.
   The protesters, wearing green parrot-feather headresses and
red-and-black war paint and carrying wooden clubs, sang tribal
chants and demanded to see President Jose Sarney.
   Sarney refused to receive the group, and an aide said the Indians
should lodge their complaints with the Interior Ministry.
   The protest was led by Chief Davi Kopenawa of the 9,000-member
Yanomami tribe. The Yanomamis live in the remote northern Amazon on
Brazil's border with Venezuela, a region rich in timber, gold and
diamonds.
   Kopenawa said the Indians wanted to deliver a petition to Sarney
demanding the immediate removal of an estimated 40,000 gold
prospectors from the Yanomami reservation. The government said it
began removing prospectors from the region Thursday.
   ``Sarney should obey the constitution,'' said Kopenawa, who last
year won a U.N. award for his defense of the environment.
   He said 70 percent of the Yanomamis' land _ originally covering
22 million acres _ have been converted into national parks and
forests. But the government has been unable or unwilling to keep
prospectors out of the mineral-rich area.
   Environmental and Indian protection groups claim the invasion of
gold miners has spread disease, made game scarce and contaminated
rivers.
   ``We don't want our families to go on dying,'' said Kopenawa,
adding that the Yanomamis wanted an emergency health plan.
   The chief threatened to return the U.N. award if the government
didn't take action against the prospectors.
   ``This medal, which I didn't ask for ... is not resolving
anything,'' he said.
   The Indians arrived in Brasilia earlier this week and tried to
meet with presidential candidates. None of the leading candidates
would meet with them.
   Brazilians are to vote Nov. 15 in the first free election for
president since 1960.
   Brazil has about 220,000 native Indians, down from an estimated 5
million when the nation was discovered by Portuguese explorers in
1500.
   Fernando Gabeira, the presidential candidate of the small Green
Party and a supporter of the Indians' cause, said ``there is no
consciousness in Brazil of the importance of Indian culture.''
   Ricardo Pedreira, the presidential press secretary, said the
government and federal police began Thursday to remove the first
group of 90 miners from Yanomami land.
   He said officials also would try to close an estimated 70
clandestine air strips on the reservation. Small planes ferry some
miners to the region.

  [Text] Chile will probably be the fifth country to join the 
Common Market of the South, Mercosur. Chilean Foreign Minister 
Carlos Figueroa and Brazilian counterpart Celso Amorim reported 
this news in Belem, Para State on the night of 5 June. Here is 
Antonia Marcia Vale's report: 
  [Begin recording] [Vale] Since the beginning of the Mercosur 
negotiations, Chile has refused to participate. The Chilean 
foreign minister now states that his country's interest in 
joining Mercosur follows President Itamar Franco's proposal, in 
Chile in December 1993, to establish a free-trade zone in Latin 
America. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim asserted that if 
Chile joins Mercosur it will be advantageous and represent a 
door for Brazilian exports to the Pacific Region market. 
  [Amorim] This possibility is important for us, not just 
because Chile has commercial and political importance or because 
of old ties that bind our two countries. Mercosur member 
countries have always considered the possibility of Chile 
becoming a member. As the Chilean foreign minister said, this 
initiative is a result of the current Brazilian Government, of 
President Itamar Franco's proposal to establish a South American 
free-trade area. This shows we have indeed been working in the 
right direction. This possibility gives us enormous 
satisfaction. 
  [Vale] The foreign minister reported that Chile's main 
concern about entering Mercosur had been the high taxes charged 
by Brazil on imported items. Minister Amorim added that this 
difficulty has practically ceased because currently our custom 
fees average just 14 percent. [end recording]

  [Text] Brazil is giving up the passive diplomacy that has 
prevailed during the past few years in its relations with 
Europe. During his visit to Germany, Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim has been trying to design a more dynamic position for 
Brazilian diplomacy and counter the self-restraint our country 
has been imposing on its foreign presence. High-level meetings 
have been scheduled for April when British Foreign Minister 
Douglas Hurd visits Brasilia, and the Brazilian foreign minister 
will visit France at the invitation of his counterpart, Alain 
Juppe. Amorim will address the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee then. 
  These bilateral meetings have not been held for some years. 
As just an example of the poor period being experienced by 
Brazilian diplomacy, the French foreign minister's visit to 
Brazil has been postponed four consecutive times during the past 
few years. 
  The positive results of the foreign minister's visit to 
Germany foreshadow a new period. In Bonn on 25 February, the 
Brazilian foreign minister himself announced these two important 
meetings with the British and French foreign ministers to O 
ESTADO DO SAO PAULO. Amorim said: "If Brazil hopes to play a 
leading role in the international arena, it cannot give up these 
talks." The Brazilian foreign minister accused former President 
Fernando Collor of destroying our country's foreign policy and 
not replacing it. 
  The Brazilian foreign minister admitted that recently our 
country has been placing less emphasis than it should on its 
bilateral relations. This explains the new effort toward 
France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, Brazil's three 
principal European partners, which represents a priority in 
Itamaraty's strategy. The effort to further approach these EC 
countries is obviously aimed at attracting technology and 
investments. Amorim emphasized: "To this end, however, it is 
necessary to hold political talks." 
  In the case of Germany, the Brazilian foreign minister 
explained: "The tripartite agreement's ratification was 
essential because diplomacy and development must work together." 
  Concerning specific projects, the minister confirmed the 
German interest in Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System]. 
The Germans are interested in installing the air traffic 
control system in the Amazon region. The French and Americans 
also have expressed interest in this project. The Brazilian 
Government's decision on the submitted proposals must be made by 
late April.

<HEAD>Ecologists Applaud Choice for New Environment Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defenders of nature say the
appointment of Jose Lutzenberger, a noted ecologist, as Brazil's
environment minister could signal an end to wanton destruction of
the Amazon rain forest.
   The choice of Lutzenberger, 63, was seen as a victory for
conservationists, who claim the government has done little to stop
slash-and-burn devastation of the Amazon. He was named by President
Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office March 15.
   By 1988, ranchers and farmers had destroyed about 8 percent of
the rain forest in the 2 million square miles of Amazon wilderness,
said U.S. researcher Philip Fearnside of the National Institute of
Research in the Amazon.
   Carbon dioxide produced by the burning is believed to add to the
``greenhouse effect'' warming the Earth's surface.
   ``Lutzenberger is the right man in the right place; nobody else
has his credibility,'' Johan Dalgas Frisch, head of the Wildlife
Preservation Association in Sao Paulo, said in an interview.
   Antonio Carlos de Oliveira of the ecology group Oikos said: ``He
is superimportant, a legend. We all have the greatest respect and
admiration for him.''
   Lutzenberger seeks radical changes in Brazil's environmental
policy. He favors solar, wind and other natural forms of energy
over the huge hydroelectric complexes of recent decades.
   A Rio newspaper made the wry comment that Lutzenberger was so
radical about protecting nature that he even opposed lawn mowers.
   The new environment minister told The Associated Press: ``We
have to question the fundamental doctrines of modern industrial
society, which is geared to the needs of the powerful. We're not
saying give up technology, but go a different way.''
   In his first week on the job, Lutzenberger spoke out against the
controversial Northern Rim project, which would create army posts
to guard Brazil's vast jungle border.
   He also promised to review a decision that allowed gold miners
to settle on land claimed by the primitive Yanomami Indians.
   Prospectors have invaded Yanomami land in the remote western
Amazon state of Roraima, devastating the forest and bringing
disease and death to the Indians.
   After consulting with Lutzenberger and visiting the area, Collor
ordered the dynamiting of clandestine air strips on tribal land and
said the Northern Rim project would be redirected toward protecting
the environment.
   ``We must remove the prospectors, but we also must give them
decent living conditions,'' Lutzenberger said. ``They are not there
because they're bad or want to destroy.''
   Lutzenberger, a descendant of German immigrants, is an
agronomist with a degree from the University of Louisiana. In the
1970s, he resigned as a chemical company executive to join the
ecology movement and helped found Brazil's first environmental
protection group.
   Later, Lutzenberger established an environmental consulting firm.
   He pushed for tougher laws on pesticide control and for
installation of anti-pollution filters at a cellulose plant in his
native Rio Grande do Sul state, in southern Brazil.
   Lutzenberger was among the first to sound the alarm about the
Amazon.
   ``This problem concerns all of humanity,'' he told reporters
shortly after becoming environment secretary.
   ``It concerns the continuation of life on this planet. This
requires not just plans for preservation, protection or parks. It
requires fundamentally rethinking our economic programs.''
   He appealed for help from industrialized countries.
   ``We must establish now an intensive and continuing dialogue
between the governments of the First World and the Third World on
how we can collaborate to save the last jungles,'' Lutzenberger
told the journalists.
   One way, he said, is to write off part of Brazil's $114 billion
foreign debt against programs to preserve the Amazon.
   Brazil has rejected such ``debt for nature'' swaps on grounds
they violate national sovereignty. Of that, Lutzenberger said:
   ``The idea is to find ways to reduce the debt in exchange for
the preservation of Amazonia by our government. There is not the
slightest intention to `internationalize' the Amazon.''
   A key test of his strength is likely to be a proposed highway
from the western Amazon through Peru to the Pacific.
   Lutzenberger opposes the highway, but Peru and governors of
Brazil's Amazonian states say it is vital to economic development
in the region. Most of the governors supported Collor for president.
   ``The important thing to watch is how much power he has. Let's
see what happens when he conflicts with the highway lobby,''
Fearnside, the U.S. researcher, said in a telephone interview from
Manaus, in the Amazon jungle 3,000 miles northwest of Rio.
   Some fear Lutzenberger's well-known temper and firm convictions
could work against him.
   ``If he's very radical, Collor will be pressured to get rid of
him,'' Frisch said.

  [Text] In a meeting of the Chamber of Deputies joint 
congressional committee for Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South], Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said that Brazil will 
invest nearly $150 million in trade with Argentina, Uruguay, and 
Paraguay this year. 
  Amorim refuted criticism that the implementation of Mercosur 
was being delayed. He added that the member countries are 
merely negotiating schedules with longer adjustment terms for 
the implementation of the common custom fee. 
  The minister told the congressmen that trade among the 
Mercosur member countries has increased from $4.5 billion to $8 
billion in the last three years.

   Here are some facts and figures on Bolivia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Bolivia is landlocked in the heart of South America
and is roughly the size of Texas and Arkansas combined. It is is
divided into three distinct geographical regions: the highlands,
the mountainous valley regions and sub-tropical lowlands. Major
cities such as La Paz, Oruro and Potosi are part of the Andes
mountain range. The lowlands include the vast savannas and
impenetrable jungles of the Beni, Pando and Santa Cruz departments,
which are traversed by thousands of miles of rivers that feed into
the Amazon.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Bolivia's 6.9 population is largely made up of
people of Quechua and Aymara Indian origin. Although Spanish is the
official language, Quechua and Aymara are widely spoken in rural
areas and in major cities. In the tropical regions, Guarani and
other native languages are also spoken. The population is largely
Roman Catholic, although Indian farmers maintain a mixture of
Catholic and Indian beliefs that include worship of a goddess of
the earth. The last two decades have seen a significant migration
of Quechua and Aymara farmers to the lowland regions, including
areas that produce sugar cane, coffee and coca leaf, which is
processed into cocaine.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY _ Aymara and other Indian cultures, which predate by
several centuries the Inca conquest of Bolivia, established an
elaborate system of government and built the city of Tiwanacu with
its vast irrigated fields and elaborate stone and ceramic figures.
The Incas conquered the highlands and some of the lowland regions
of Bolivia in the 13th century. The Spanish conquerors took over in
1538. Bolivia, which is named after its liberator Simon Bolivar,
became independent from Spain in 1825 and separated itself from
Peru. In a series of wars over the next century, Bolivia lost its
Pacific coast to Chile, part of its Amazon to Brazil and some of
its southern territory to Paraguay.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Bolivia has a free market economy that has begun
to see stability. In 1985, tough austerity measures were used to
control hyper-inflation, which had soared to 23,000 percent.
Inflation has plunged to 15 percent and the government estimates
that the economy will grow by 3.5 percent in 1989. Bolivia seeks
foreign investors interested in mining, petroleum exploration and
agriculture. Bolivia is still heavily dependent, however, on
cocaine trafficking, which brings in an estimated $200 million to
$300 million a year and provides a livelihood to 300,000 Bolivians.
Natural gas, which earned $214 million in exports last year, has
supplanted minerals as the main source of export earnings, which
totalled $600.5 million in 1988. Mineral exports amounted to $196
million in 1988.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE CULTURE _ Bolivia has a rich and dynamic culture rooted in
its Indian heritage. Aymara and Quechua Indians make exquisite
weavings and outfits and have elaborate rituals and festivals that
date to pre-Colombian times. The rich cultural diversity is
manifest during carnival in the mining city of Oruro and Gran Poder
in La Paz when thousands of dancers wearing elaborate masks and
outfits pay homage to patron saints. Bolivia also has a rich
musical and visual arts tradition.

  [Text] AGENCIA BRASIL reported that Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim, indirectly referring to the United States, yesterday 
criticized the adoption of unilateral measures by some countries 
"without respect for international law and to the detriment of 
the development of countries such as Brazil and Cuba [no closing 
quotation mark as published]. The foreign minister said Brazil 
refuses "to admit the imposition of other countries' laws" 
within its territory, alluding to the Torricelli Law which 
punishes U.S. companies that do business with Cuba, even though 
they are subsidiaries installed in other countries. 
  Amorim's observations came during a speech at a lunch 
offered 
in honor of Cuba's Vice President Carlos Lage who began a 
two-day visit to Brasilia today. Amorim expressed hope that the 
political changes being implemented in Cuba today will "help to 
facilitate, as we all wish, Cuba's full reinsertion in the 
hemisphere's coexistence." 
  The Brazilian foreign minister said Brazil and Cuba can join 
forces "to overcome our weaknesses," citing as examples the 
benefits that might be derived from the recent bilateral 
agreement for the purchase of medicines in Cuba; exchanges in 
the agroindustrial field, particularly on sugar and alcohol; and 
bilateral scientific and technical cooperation. 
  The Cuban vice president said that during his conversation 
with Amorim the Brazilian foreign minister reiterated Brazil's 
position against the U.S. embargo on Cuba. "The embargo has 
caused our country many difficulties and it is important that it 
is rejected by all Latin American countries," Carlos Lage said.

  [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro's invitation to former 
Brazilian President Fernando Collor to spend a few days in 
Varadero, a Cuban sea resort, has displeased Brazilian President 
Itamar Franco and has taken Itamaraty [Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry] by surprise. It is possible that Franco will eliminate 
from his agenda a meeting with Cuban Vice President [title as 
published] Carlos Lage Davila, who will be officially visiting 
Brazil 2-7 February. 
  Cuban Ambassador to Brazil Jorge Bolanos went to Itamaraty 
on 
21 January and told Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim that 
Castro's invitation to Fernando Collor was strictly personal. 
According to Itamaraty spokesman Luiz Fernando Benedini, the 
meeting between Minister Amorim and the Cuban ambassador had 
been scheduled in advance. Benedini denied that the ambassador 
had been summoned for an explanation. The spokesman refused to 
comment on behalf of the minister on the possible displeasure 
that Castro's invitation to Brazil's former president, found 
guilty of malfeasance in office, may have caused. 
  According to information on hand, the former president was 
supposed to go to Cuba as part of a business delegation together 
with his old friend, businessman Luiz Estevao. Collor was 
reportedly invited to stay at the official guest house in 
Varadero where his former wife Lilibeth Monteiro de Carvalho and 
his children Arnon Affonso and Joaquim Pedro have stayed in the 
past. The trip of the business delegation was postponed because 
the health of Luiz Estevao's father took a turn for the worse, 
but Collor confirmed that he plans to spend a few days in Cuba. 
Fidel Castro -- who still maintains a personal relationship 
with the former Brazilian president -- was unable to withdraw 
his earlier invitation. 
  Vice President Carlos Lage's official visit to Brazil had 
been arranged some time ago. Lage's agenda includes meetings 
with President Franco, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Health Minister Henrique 
Santillo. 
  [Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese on 21 January on 
page A6 carries a 200-word report noting that "on 22 January 
Collor will be boarding a plane for Cuba, the first leg of a 
30-day vacation. Collor, who is traveling with his wife Rosane, 
will visit Cuba, then go to Paris and end up in the Cap Ferrat 
resort in France."]

<HEAD>Church Group Denounces Violence Against Native Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A church group on Wednesday denounced the
slaying of 36 Indians during 1988 and blamed the government of
President Jose Sarney for ``increasing violence against native
populations'' in Brazil.
   At least 28 of the deaths were linked to battles over land, and
in the majority of cases ``authorities took no measures to find or
punish the guilty parties,'' Antonio Brand, executive secretary of
the Indian Missionary Council, said in a press conference.
   Brand said the worst Indian massacre last year was the March 28
slaying of 14 Tikuna Indians in the far northern state of Amazonas
after a dispute over land with a wealthy wood dealer.
   In a press release, the council also mentioned the death of 25
Yanomami Indians through diseases transmitted by white men such as
malaria or poisoning by mercury, which is used by gold prospectors
to refine the precious metal.
   Brand said the government's refusal to remove the thousands of
gold prospectors from Yanomami territory in the Amazon jungle region
``will allow the continued massacre of this people.''
   The Yanomami Indians are Brazil's most primitive tribe and live
almost without contact with the modern world close to Brazil's
northern border with Venezuela.
   Brand said the government was ``responsible for the state of
chronic violence'' that exists in the rain forest, which is rich in
gold, diamonds, iron ore and uranium.
   Currently about 220,000 native Indians and 430 tribes remain out
of a population estimated at 5 million when Brazil was discovered by
the Portuguese.
   About 15 percent of the Amazon has been destroyed by farming,
gold prospecting and mining, according to the U.S.-based Institute
for Policy Studies. An estimated 400,000 gold prospectors are
located throughout the Amazon and, along with farmers and
wood-cutters, often involve themselves in territory disputes with
Indians.

contacts he has been having and of Itamar Franco's visit to 
Portugal. 
  [Begin recording] [Soares] First of all, at the invitation 
of 
Vice President Itamar Franco, we are preparing a major meeting 
to be held in Lisbon and a major meeting of Lusophone countries 
at a head-of-state level. [passage omitted] 
  [Saldanha] You place great importance on the July meeting of 
Lusophone countries, and I know that that is related to the 
importance you give to a greater weight of those countries in 
the UN. Do you think that could help Portugal in matters such 
as Indonesia? 
  [Soares] Of course. They all have come out, and even Brazil 
recently came out very clearly in favor of East Timor and in 
favor of its self-determination. This carries some weight. But 
I am thinking beyond the present. I am thinking of the future. 
  [Saldanha] Are you thinking of the community of Lusophone 
countries the Brazilian ambassador talks of? 
  [Soares] Exactly. I am thinking of a community, a 
Luso-Afro-Brazilian community that could have an important 
specific weight in the 21st century. 
  [Saldanha] And do you think that is viable considering the 
conditions in Mozambique and Angola? 
  [Soares] Precisely, what I want is a joint plan by Portugal 
and Brazil to help our African brothers, who are in a bad 
situation but will be great nations in the future. 
  [Saldanha] Have you invited President Itamar to visit 
Portugal before the end of your mandate? 
  [Soares] Naturally, it has been confirmed that he will visit 
in June. Before the summit of heads of state, he will come on a 
bilateral state visit to Portugal, and I will have the honor of 
receiving him in Lisbon. [end recording]

<HEAD>Brazil's Environment Chief Vows to Develop the Amazon `Humanely'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Brazil's environment czar vowed Tuesday
to curb the destruction of the Amazon rain forest and to develop
the biologically sensitive area in a ``rational, humane and
ecological'' manner.
   ``We can't stop development and growth, but yes, we can make
human occupation compatible with the survival of the planet,'' said
National Environment Secretary Jose Lutzenberger.
   Lutzenberger, 64, outlined a plan for encouraging development
and farming while preserving the unique ecological balance of the
2-million square mile rain forest.
   A world-renown ecologist, he said the government will introduce
a program to revitalize the forest's soil through organic
agricultural methods and to reduce the traditional style of
slash-and-burn farming that has destroyed 200,000 square miles of
the region.
   He said the Collor de Mello administration, which first took
office in March, will also quadruple its fire-fighting efforts.
   ``In this way we will stop small farmers, impoverished by soil
that only gives two or three harvests, from burning other tracts of
the jungle,'' said Lutzenberger. He said the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank had expressed interest in financing
the program but gave no details.
   Slash-and-burn farmers clear large tracts of unused land by
setting fires and then plant crops until the soil is exhausted.
They then move on to fresh land.
   Lutzenberger said the burnings are now monitored by satellites
that can detect even small brush fires. He said forest rangers in
helicopters are used to catch and fine violators.
   He said Brazil will also explore alternative energy sources such
as solar, wind and biomass energy instead of building the huge
hydroelectric dams that were popular in recent decades.
   Environmentalists have opposed the dams saying they flood huge
tracts of Amazon land, killing trees and animals while providing
few benefits for the thousands of Indians and Brazilian farmers
living in the area.
   He specifically singled out the Itaipu dam, built by Brazil and
Paraguay on the Parana River dividing the countries and the Tucurui
project in the Amazon jungle.
   ``Itaipu only produces at 60 percent of its capacity and we
don't even know what to do with so much energy,'' Lutzenberger
said. ``Tucurui generates electricity for large aluminum factories
that export minerals at low cost and the Amazon natives don't see
any benefit.''
   Lutzenberger said Brazil should scrap plans for large dams in
the rain forest and concentrate instead on promoting small
generators and floating river turbines financed and run by local
municipalities and private businessmen.
   The appointment of Lutzenberger, an agronomist educated in the
United States, was seen as a victory for conservationists, who
claim Brazil has traditionally done little to preserve the Amazon.
   ``There are many people who would like to see the jungle
disappear to raise cattle, but they won't do it with my approval,''
he said.

<LEADPARA>  MANY centuries ago, the Yanomami tribe of the northern Amazon said the Earth
was blue and covered by a thin layer. But the "civilized world" didn't believe
it until cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin saw from space that it was true. They also
said there was a hole in the sky.;    So explained Milton Nascimento to a
sell-out crowd at the Mountain View Center for Performing Arts on Sunday. But
this was no wake for our ravaged planet. It was a joyous celebration of life
by Brazil's most successful musical ambassador.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Nascimento, a composer of gorgeous melodies with two voices to match -- a
lush baritone and an irresistible falsetto -- has an abiding faith that the
web of life for which the rain forest is a metaphor will survive. One could
see his great heart reaching to believe it, as he sang the love song to an
endangered people, "Yanomami e Nos" ("Yanomami and Us").;    Perched on a
stool and sporting his trademark floppy white cap, the 49-year-old pop
star-turned-environmental-crusader regaled the house with a nearly seamless
progression of undulating rhythms, soaring lyricism and just the right amount
of social consciousness.;    The singer from the desolate backlands of Minas
Gerais brought with him a powerhouse band of three drummer/percussionists
(Vanderlei, Ronaldo and their father, Robertinho Silva); electric bassist Joao
Baptista and keyboardist Tulio Mourao. With Nascimento strumming an acoustic
guitar -- or conducting with his hands -- the six men produced an amazing
quantity of sound: delicate harmonies, rollicking anthems and explosive
percussion jams.;    Except for the (taped) introduction spoken by River
Phoenix from the current Columbia release, "Txai," there wasn't much English,
but the audience seemed to get the message.;    "They don't need our
language," Phoenix concludes in the narration, "to know we've sold them down
the river -- and franchised our own souls.";    That album was the fruit of an
18-day trip Nascimento and a team of anthropologists, musicologists and
ecologists made up the Jurua River from Cruzeiro do Sul in the Brazilian state
of Acre to the Peruvian border in September 1989. Because of sandbars, they
had to travel the last part of the way by canoe. That trip, the album and the
current tour -- which continues to Berkeley; Vancouver, British Columbia;
Seattle; Austin, Texas; New Orleans; Houston and Chicago -- is part of a
campaign in support of the Alianca dos Povos da Floresta (Alliance for the
People of the Forest).;    We may think of the Amazon as a single river, but
it has 1,000 tributaries, 17 of which are 1,000 miles long. Its 898,000 square
miles are home to 200,000 Indians. More than one-third of the tribes extant in
1900 have vanished.;    "Txai" contains samples of indigenous music from the
Yanomami, Waiapi, Kayapo and Paiter peoples. There wasn't much of that Sunday
night, although Nascimento sang "Nozani Na" in Paiter.;    Txai, a Kaxinawa
word originally expressing a kinship relation, has been adopted by the rubber
tappers, fishermen and other river people of Acre as an expression of respect
for all allies of the forest people. It translates as "companion" or "the
other half of me.";    Nascimento and his cohorts made all within earshot feel
that kinship Sunday night. "Yanomami," he said, "is life."; Milton Nascimento;

<F P=106> [Report by Marco Antonio Moreira] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Jun (AE) -- To offset the setback 
suffered by Brazilian Ambassador to Portugal Jose Aparecido de 
Oliveira over the last-minute cancellation of his trip to 
Lisbon, President Itamar Franco today asked former President 
Jose Sarney (who is a senator for the Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party, Amapa State) to head the Brazilian delegation to 
the Seminar on Economic and Entrepreneurial Cooperation and to 
the signing of the declaration creating the Community of 
Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). 
  Sarney promptly accepted the invitation, which was extended 
personally by Franco. Sarney returned from France on 20 June. 
Today he stayed home recovering from labyrinthitis. At 1700 on 
22 June, Sarney will meet with the members of the Brazilian 
delegation to discuss details of the trip, which is scheduled to 
start on 24 June. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has informed 
the Portuguese Government about the change. 
  Franco said by asking Sarney to head the delegation he was 
paying tribute to the presidents of Portugal, Angola, Cape 
Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe 
because the first meeting aimed at creating the International 
Institute of the Portuguese Language with the attendance of the 
heads of state of these countries was held on 3 November [no 
year given] in Sao Luiz (Maranhao) and was organized by 
Ambassador de Oliveira, who was then culture minister of the 
Sarney government. 
  In a communique released today at Planalto Palace, the 
president states that despite having postponed his trip to 
Portugal, he will visit that country before the end of his term 
to commemorate the creation of the CPLP and to resume bilateral 
talks with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco e Silva. The 
Brazilian delegation will include cabinet ministers, executives 
of state-owned companies, and private businessmen who will pay 
their own travel expenses. 
  Presidential Spokesman Fernando Costa has said Franco's 
decision to postpone the trip was in no way related to the death 
of his nephew and private secretary Ariosto Franco, although the 
cancellation came after his death. "The president was shaken by 
Ariosto's death," Costa said, "but he has chosen to stay in 
Brazil because he considers his presence necessary on the eve of 
the implementation of the real."

  [Text] Representatives from seven Portuguese-speaking 
countries are discussing in Brasilia the formation of an 
international community. They met this morning in Itamaraty. 
  These representatives came from Africa and Europe. They have 
something in common with Brazil, their language -- Portuguese. 
Based on this common feature, the foreign ministers from seven 
countries are discussing the formation of a community of 
Portuguese- speaking countries to exchange technology and 
cooperation in the cultural, social, and economic areas and 
reach political agreements. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim emphasized the 
efforts made by these countries to end racism and the 
significance of the new community: 
  [Begin Amorim recording] We are living in a world of 
variable associations in which it is important to channel common 
elements for more resolute actions in the international arena. 
[end recording] 
  Brazilian Ambassador to Portugal Jose Aparecido de Oliveira, 
one of the architects of the community of Portuguese-speaking 
countries, said it already was time for the idea to materialize 
and used the occasion to ask for the foreigners' support for 
proposing sociologist Herbert de Souza, nicknamed Betinho, as a 
candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
  [Begin Aparecido recording] I believe he is the candidate of 
the nations that speak our language. In this regard, he 
represents the moral and human conscience of 210 million people 
scattered throughout the continents. [end recording] 
  The presidents of these seven Portuguese-speaking countries 
will meet this year in Lisbon to formalize all the documents 
signed at today's meeting. 
  The foreign ministers will visit the Federal Supreme Court 
and Congress this afternoon. They will have dinner with 
President Itamar Franco at the JK Memorial tonight.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ What happened in the American West a century ago
is happening today to the Indians of Brazil's Amazon Basin. It is
called ``ethnocide'' by some, a fight for survival by others.
Ironically, the fate of the Indians may be tied to the fate of the
environment as well.

   To symbolize his mourning, the young
Indian, wearing a suit, smeared a dark paste over his face and
walked up to the microphone facing hundreds of Brazilian
congressmen. He didn't say a word.
   That was last year when Brazil's lawmakers met to write a new
constitution, the country's eighth.
   Now, recalling the moment, Ailton Krenak, 33, explains, ``I
wanted to call attention to the lack of respect for the rights and
how government policy has killed us.''
   Krenak, coordinator of the Indian Nations of Brazil, which
represents 100 tribes, adds, ``It's a race against time because
soon there won't be any Indians left.''
   Anthropologists and Indian rights groups say the government is
committing ``ethnocide'' because violence, disease and land
invasion by mineral and agricultural interests are wiping out the
tribes and their cultures and with them the mighty Amazon forest.
   The Indians want their land preserved. They also want protection
from diseases that are foreign to them.
   The new constitution, inaugurated in October, does guarantee
Brazil's 250,000 native Indians the ``exclusive rights'' to their
land and its resources, which previously belonged to the federal
government.
   Brazil, with the Western world's eighth largest economy, still
grapples with its Indian question 100 years after the United States
and other nations resolved theirs, mostly by violence.
   When Brazil was discovered in 1500 by Portuguese explorers, 5
million Indians occupied the region. Today, only 5 percent of that
number survive. They make up 518 groups with 50 different languages
and 170 dialects. In addition, about 3,000 to 5,000 Indians, some
40 groups, still live isolated in the Amazon rain forest and have
had no contact with civilization.
   Contact often is fatal. Some Indians are killed in violent
encounters with outsiders, but most die because they have no
immunities against common diseases transmitted by whites, such as
malaria, tuberculosis, influenza or even the common cold.
   In the first half of this century alone, 87 Indian groups
disappeared, largely because of viruses. Experts estimate that 45
percent of a given Indian population dies within two years of the
first contact with outsiders.
   In Brazil, everyone agrees Indians can't remain isolated
forever. But ethical, ideological and practical questions arise as
to the best way to incorporate them into society.
   ``Continuing isolation is impossible, but brusque and violent
encounters with modern Brazil kill them,'' says Julio Gaiger, a
lawyer with the Indigenous Missionary Council, an activist group
linked to Brazil's dominant Roman Catholic church.
   Gaiger and Indian protection groups believe that if Indians are
given correct information they can decide for themselves how and to
what extent they want to join the larger society. They argue that
Indians can retain their culture if their lands are protected and
if they have self-determination.
   In all, Indian tribal lands take up 8 percent of Brazil, a
nation larger than the continental United States, and most Indians
live in the Amazon rain forest where minerals, lumber and gold
abound.
   But the government recognizes less than half the tribes' habitat
as Indian reserves. Studies conducted by the National Museum and
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro show 70 percent of land
specifically marked off as belonging to Indians has been invaded by
mineral companies.
   Despite Brazil's potential, its economic woes are enormous. It
has the largest foreign debt in the Third World, 600 percent yearly
inflation, 12 million landless rural families, an estimated 10
million street children and stark poverty, reflected by 70 million
of its 144 million people earning just $65 a month.
   In its haste to grow economically and realize its ancient dream
to populate the Amazon and protect its borders with nine South
American nations, Brazil's policy is to integrate Indians into
``civilization.''
   ``It is our moral duty to give Indians the same privileges that
the overall population has,'' says Deputy Foreign Minister Paulo
Tarso Flecha de Lima. ``It is our responsibility to bring them into
society. We can't leave them in their primitive state. ''
   Anthropologists charge that at the rate Brazil is clearing away
and burning off its Amazon forest for development, thousands of
Indians will die and those who survive will become third-rate
citizens.
   ``They get the worst jobs, lead miserable lives, and become
alcoholics or prostitutes,'' says anthropologist and Indian
activist Ezequias Paulo Heringer.
   Bruce Albert, a French anthropologist who has worked in Brazil
for more than a decade, says, ``Ideally, outside contact should be
avoided altogether, but when it can't be avoided, a strong health
scheme should be mounted and Indians should be vaccinated.''

<HEAD>Indian Chief: Brazilian Miners Invading Amazon Reserves</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of gold prospectors expelled
from Yanomami Indian lands have invaded other Amazon reserves and
spread malaria among the tribes, an Indian chief said Thursday.
   The claims were made as representatives from 12 indigenous
groups of the far-western Amazon state of Roraima came to the
capital in search of medical aid. The Indian chiefs also want the
government to demarcate their lands and expel the miners.
   Makuxi chief Jaci said Thursday that about 8,000 gold miners
were spreading malaria among his 12,000-member tribe. The Makuxis,
mostly farmers, inhabit a large reserve near the Venezuelan border.
   The Indian leader said 154 of 990 Makuxi in four villages had
been infected the last three months. Five of those had died,
including his own wife.
   In addition, he said 122 ranchers had also occupied large tracts
of the Makuxi reserve, taking advantage of the lack of reserve
markings.
   Last January, the government ordered the miners off the reserve
of the Yanomamis, the world's largest primitive tribe. But since
then the prospectors have poured into a region near the Guyana
border in search of gold and diamonds, Jaci said.
   Neither the National Indian Foundation nor the Justice Ministry
would meet with the Indian chiefs on Thursday, Jaci said.
   The government has said it lacks the money needed to demarcate
the tribes' lands and remove the miners by force.
   ``All the medical attention is given to the Yanomamis. The
government has forgotten the rest of us,'' Jaci complained.
   The Yanomamis are also being decimated by diseases from about
40,000 gold prospectors who have flooded into the mineral-rich
region the last three years.
   Brazil's Indian Missionary Council, sponsored by the Roman
Catholic Church, estimates that 1,500 of the remaining 9,000
Yanomamis have died in three years, most from malaria and sexual
diseases brought by miners. Some have died in conflicts with the
miners, the Council says.
   The Indians' medical situation has improved recently, according
to government officials, because of an emergency health campaign
that it says has cut the incidence of malaria in Indian villages
from 90 percent to 18 percent.
   Federal police have also begun ``Operation Free Yanomami
Jungle,'' to force the miners off the Indian lands. About 140
troops are dynamiting 120 clandestine landing strips cut in the
jungle and used to supply mining sites by air.
   Brazil's Indians have steadily dwindled in number since 1987,
when the clandestine rush to the Amazon began after government
studies indicated a wealth of gold, diamonds, tin and bauxite
there.
   Prospectors and landless peasants have leveled rain forests,
chased off fish and game, polluted rivers with mercury used in gold
panning, and spread diseases previously unknown to the tribes.
   There are about 215,000 native Indians left in Brazil, down from
an estimated 5 million when the Portuguese landed here in 1500.

the controversial accord they signed Sunday will create a unified
market for Portuguese-language books and movies.
   The accord simplifies and harmonizes spellings of a wide list of
vocabulary. It also adds three new letters to the alphabet and
removes some accents and letters that are no longer spoken.
   But critics say the accord could muddle the tongue.
   When it takes full effect by the beginning of 1994, some
Portuguese words with very different roots and meaning will be
spelled the same.

FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology: Operation Amazon - Christina Lamb describes
plans to put satellite images of the Brazilian rainforest on computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Name the remotest part of the Amazon rainforest to Diogenes Sales Alves and
with the flick of a few switches on his computer he can tell you how much if
any deforestation the area has suffered, when and how it happened, whether
it contains any Indian settlements, any mining or agricultural activity.
Alves is head of a research project at the Brazilian Aerospace Institute
(INPE) to compile from satellite images the first comprehensive analysis of
the world's largest rainforest. The project, detailing everything down to
the last nut gatherer, is expected to be completed by April. It is planned
to be one of the highlights of the UN Environment Conference, or Earth
Summit as it is known, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro in June.
Not only will the study enable examination of geological, hydrological and
botanical features (and changes caused by human activity) in the 5.2m sq km
of jungle, including areas which have never been penetrated, it will also
provide valuable information for some of today's most controversial
environmental debates such as whether forest burning is more detrimental to
climate change than automobile emissions.
In recognition of its work in using satellites to analyse the effect of
human development of the Amazon, INPE has been chosen to co-ordinate a study
of the world's forests for the Space Agencies Forum. The results will be
presented at the Earth Summit.
Surprisingly, INPE has only been studying the Amazon for three years. 'In
1988 when global warming became a general preoccupation the world started
wanting accurate information about the rate of Amazonian deforestation, so
we were asked by the Brazilian government to do a study,' explains Paulo
Serra, head of terrestrial observations.
Beginning in April 1989 INPE devised a method using computer algorithms to
calculate yearly deforestation from remote sensing satellite images taken by
the American Landsat 5. Since 1984 the satellite has passed over the same
point every 16 days from a 710km high orbit. This means that it always
photographs Brazilian territory in the morning when cloud cover is still
extensive so it is not ideal.
The satellite images are received in Cuiaba in the west of Brazil and
transmitted 1,400km to an INPE station at Cachoeira where they are processed
to generate photos. Landsat captures light reflected from the earth's
surface, producing an image on a scale of 1:250,000 in varying tones of
grey. The photographs are given artificial colours - green for forest,
darkening according to the density, pink for barren areas, grey for smoke
from burnings and blue for rivers and dams.
The best 229 photos in terms of clarity of those produced each year are
selected, each covering 185 sq km. Examination of these photographs was used
in 1989, 1990 and 1991 to calculate the yearly rate of deforestation. But,
says Serra: 'We realised this was an enormous amount of work just to get one
number - so we decided to analyse the photos so that we can say when, where
and how an area was deforested.'
To do this INPE has developed its own geographic information system.
According to Serra: 'It is not very complicated - really just a matter of
common language on what is deforestation - there is a lot of area in the
Amazon which is neither rainforest nor deforestation.'
Now when the satellite photographs are taken to INPE headquarters at Sao
Jose dos Campos to be interpreted, the images are colour coded to represent
deforestation of different years. The resulting maps are fed into the
computer and can then be used not only to evaluate more accurately the rate
of deforestation but also to study its effect on carbon- and hydro-cycles.
Some 334 maps will be created to cover the whole area.
'Rather than simply having photos in archives, we can call up any area on
computer from which we can make 1,000 observations,' Serra explains. 'I can
pick a piece of land near Manaus and say that it suffered X amount of
deforestation in 1988 because of this, nothing in 1989 and Y amount in 1990
because of something else. I can see what was deforested for agriculture,
for hydroelectric dams, for garimpagem (informal mining) or simply
disappeared, each of which has a different impact on the greenhouse effect.'
Other uses for the computerised maps include looking at areas inhabited by
Yanomami Indians and other indigenous tribes to see where their settlements
are and to follow their movements and discover where there have been
encroachments by garimpeiros or even cocaine smugglers building illegal
airstrips. The maps will be used for the zoning of the 9.4m hectares
recently declared a reserve for the Yanomamis.
Serra says the maps will also enable the study of the dynamics of forest
nutrients, in terms of soil, gases and the waterboard. It will look at how
deforestation has affected drainage and where streams have dried up because
of silt produced by mining or reduction of forest protection.
They should also end ambiguities in, for example, how much of the forest has
been destroyed and the efficacy of Brazilian government attempts to outlaw
burnings. The government environment agency claims that burnings were down
last year on the 14,000 sq km deforested in 1989-90, but ecologists say they
are back at 1988-89 levels of 23,800 sq km.
The INPE team does not underestimate the importance of the project. 'Not
only are we creating the first ever Amazonian database which can be used by
the whole world but we may also resolve some long- running debates in
Brazil's favour,' Serra claims.
With a sly smile, he adds: 'Imagine the enormous effect if we could show
through this that Amazon burning has much less impact on the carbon cycle
and thus climate change than burning fossil fuels or running cars?'

<DATELINE>
   THE KARI-OCA INDIAN VILLAGE, RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE grounds of a mental asylum were the bizarre setting yesterday for the
first official event of the UN Conference on Environment and Development,
better known as the Earth Summit.
Aborigines, inuit (eskimos), North American Indians, tribal Africans and
Amazonian Indians in full paint and feathers gathered together in a mock
Indian village in the grounds of Curicica Mental Hospital on the hills
outside Rio de Janeiro for the first ever World Conference of Indigenous
People, much to the amusement of the inmates.
Most had come by aircraft and car, rejecting the grass huts of the Kari-oca
village built by Indians with authentic materials from the Xingu National
Park, in favour of air-conditioned hotels in the city.
Some 500 Indians from five continents will meet all week to discuss topics
such as biodiversity, intellectual property and sustainable development, to
prepare a document to be presented to Mr Maurice Strong, secretary general
of the Earth Summit.
According to Mr Marcos Terena, a Brazilian Indian chief co-ordinating the
conference, the aim is 'to ensure that indigenous people have a voice' in
the official summit which starts next Wednesday, and are not 'just
considered in folkloric terms'.
Specific concerns include recognition of intellectual property rights for
use of medicinal plants from Indian areas, sovereignty rights and deciding
on a position for the 500th anniversary of the European discovery of the
Americas.
Mr Donald Rocas, an Indian from Costa Rica, says: 'This conference is
fundamental because it deals with all our lives - not just those of
indigenous people but also non-indigenous who need to learn from us how to
look after land and resources crucial for the planet's survival.'
Ms Helen Corbett, who is leading an Aborigine delegation from Australia,
says: 'The main issue for us is sovereignty for aborigines to prevent
destruction of our land and death of our people.'
However, there is doubt over how representative the conference delegates
are. Brazilian Indians spoken to in Para and Amazonas over the last month
were completely unaware of the event and expressed interest in visiting Rio.
The Earth Summit will be the first big post-cold-war conference, with around
18 new European countries in attendance. Mr Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's chief
negotiator, describes it as 'the most important non-confrontational
conference since San Francisco in 1945'.
Over the weekend the 10m residents of Rio had their first taste of what is
to come with the testing of security operations, which brought traffic to a
complete standstill and caused some panicked residents to think a military
coup had been launched. Some 6,000 army officers patrolled the streets in
tanks with heavy arms, practising for the summit, at which about 125 heads
of state are expected.
One of the leaders of the Brazilian delegation complained after being tailed
by three riflemen: 'The military seem to be taking things to extremes - are
we really going to open tank fire if any problems emerge ?'
For those concerned about pickpockets, Rio's most famous escaped British
train robber, Ronald Biggs, is giving security hints on a daily radio
programme throughout the conference.

  [Text] The Rio Group, which is an association of Latin 
American countries, today concludes a preparatory meeting for 
the Rio Group presidential summit next September. The group is 
mainly discussing the social-economic development in the region, 
as explained by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] The subjects are democracy, human 
rights, sustained development, and science and technology. This 
meeting obviously cannot exhaust all subjects, because it is 
merely the preparation for a process that will conclude with a 
presidential summit in September. Beside economic and social 
development, as well as poverty -- which are essential subjects 
-- I believe we will also discuss the possibility of a consensus 
on the hemispheric conference. [end recording] 
  The election of the next OAS secretary general is another 
subject to be discussed in this Rio Group meeting.

<HEAD>Brazil to Remove Gold Miners from Amazon Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has announced a $4
million operation to remove tens of thousands of illegal gold
miners from the Amazon jungle lands of the Yanomami Indians, one of
the world's largest primitive tribes.
   The operation is a response to an international outcry to
protect the Yanomamis from disease and violence brought by the
miners, said the National Indian Office in Brasilia, the capital.
   ``We're backed by a presidential decree and humanitarian
reasons. The miners will be removed by force if necessary,'' Col.
Airton Alcantara Gomes, No. 2 at the Indian Office, said in a
telephone interview.
   About 40,000 clandestine miners are believed to have invaded
Yanomami lands in the remote northwestern state of Roraima, near
Brazil's border with Venezuela. Some 9,000 Yanomamis live in the
region, which is rich in gold, tin and diamonds.
   ``Mining is an evil, and not even a necessary evil,'' Gomes
said. ``It pollutes the rivers, destroys the rain forest and
devastates Indian tribes.'' The operation is to start Sunday with
the closing of air strips near Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima.
Only four strips will be kept open for official use, he said.
   ``Small planes are the main means of bringing in food, supplies,
fuel, guns, alcohol, drugs, everything. We'll even seize planes if
necessary,'' Gomes said.
   About 400 federal police, Air Force and Indian Office agents
then will comb the jungle to find and remove prospectors, he said.
   Gomes said government agents expected to face violent resistance
from some miners, instigated by the controllers of the mining sites.
   ``The only ones who profit from gold mining are a half dozen big
controllers and a few airplane owners. The benefit for the country
is zero, because most of the gold is smuggled out,'' he said.
   The removal is expected to take 60 days. Federal police will be
permanently stationed in the region to prevent miners from
returning, Gomes said.
   In a separate operation, five medical teams from the Health
Ministry and the Indian Office began visiting Yanomami villages to
treat a growing outbreak of disease.
   ``Because of the presence of the miners, many Indians have
malaria, tuberculosis and venereal diseases. There also is a lot of
malnutrition, because fish and game have disappeared from some
areas,'' Gomes said.
   Traveling by helicopter and on foot, the medical teams are to
visit every Yanomami village in 45 days and distribute 8,140 pounds
of medicine and supplies, he said.
   Environmental and Indian defense groups in November told the
nation's Congress that 280 Yanomamis had died since 1987. About 70
percent of the tribal land, which originally covered 22 million
acres, has been made into national forests and parks.
   Defenders of the Yanomami cause include British rock star Sting
and Indian chief Davi Kopenawa, winner of a United Nations Global
500 award in 1988 for defense of the environment.
   There are about 220,000 native Indians left in Brazil, down from
an estimated 5 million when the country was discovered by the
Portuguese in 1500.

<F P=106> [Report by Elsy Fors] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 25 Jan (PL) -- Under the banner of 
indispensable unity and continental integration, the fourth 
Latin American and Caribbean meeting got under way with the 
presence of President Fidel Castro and 1,000 delegates from all 
the countries of the region. 
  Indian leaders, politicians, intellectuals, professionals, 
and believers of the most varied religions of all the countries 
of the hemisphere, including the United States and Canada, have 
heeded the summons to this meeting for the solidarity, 
sovereignty, self- determination, and lives of our peoples. 
  The Cuban president, who heads the host delegation, received 
the acclamation of the participants at the meeting, which will 
conclude on Friday, 28 January. 
  Representatives from previous host countries of the forum -- 
Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil -- spoke during the inaugural 
session and concurred in calling for the unity of regional 
progressive forces, the integration of their countries, and 
solidarity with Cuba. 
  Camilo Restrepo of Ecuador referred to the extremely grave 
economic situation of the majority of the Latin American 
population, where poverty is on the increase due to the effects 
of neoliberal economic policies. 
  In turn, Colombian Ivan Foredo said those attending this 
meeting were the genuine heirs of Latin America's struggle for 
liberty, and he called on them to speak out against the inhuman 
U.S. blockade against Cuba, who maintains, he added, the 
socialist program more than ever. 
  Amir Lando, senator for the Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party, stated solidarity stresses the need to be organized. We 
have the capacity and the duty, he stated, to make our 
convictions reach our peoples. 
  The Brazilian legislator compared Cuban health indicators to 
Brazil's, where the life expectancy is 58 years in comparison to 
75 years in Cuba, and where the infant mortality rate is 69 for 
very 1,000 live births as opposed to 9.5 in Cuba. 
  Regarding the Brazilian experience in the implementation of 
neoliberal adjustments, Lando said the privatization process, 
far from replacing state enterprises with a policy of 
development, had exchanged state monopolies for private business 
monopolies that take away the country's wealth. 
  Jose Ramon Balaguer, Politburo member of the Communist Party 
of Cuba and head of the Ideological Department, spoke on behalf 
of Cuba, stressing the complex international panorama in which 
the meeting is being held. 
  He indicated a decade of changes born under an adverse sign 
of unipolar power began not long ago. He noted that within this 
context, Cuba feels capable of making its own alternatives. 
  Referring to the difficult economic situation in the 
country, 
Balaguer said the road to recovery has begun, albeit slowly, 
mostly because of the impact of the U.S. embargo, which has 
lasted more than three decades. 
  The Cuban leader called on the participants to strive for 
unity because there will be no future without unity and 
integration. This afternoon, the forum is expected to begin 
debating in four commissions, namely, political, economic, 
cultural, and organizational commissions. On 27 January, groups 
will contact unions, Indians, women, religious groups, community 
organizations, friendship and solidarity with Cuba associations, 
intellectuals, artists, and legislators. On Friday, the 
participants will return to the plenum where they will report on 
the work done by the committees and close the meeting with a 
party at the Panamerican Villa, east of Havana.

  [Text] The AIDS virus has now stricken 13 million adults 
and a million children worldwide: 2.5 million people have AIDS. 
World Health Organization (WHO) projections indicate that, by 
the end of the 1990's, there will be 43 million infected people 
in the world. Moreover, 10 million children will be left orphans 
of parents who were victims of the disease. "AIDS is one of the 
most serious problems confronted by the human race," declared 
Lair Guerra de Macedo, coordinator of the Health Ministry's 
Program To Fight AIDS, yesterday. She spoke during the course of 
the World Day To Combat AIDS program, in which health ministers 
have participated since 1985, when the program was created. 
  In Brazil, the statistics from 1980 until 30 October of this 
year show an accumulation of 43,964 AIDS cases, revealing that 
41 percent of those infected have already died. There are 
420,000 Brazilians with HIV. It is expected that, during the 
next two years, 87,000 new cases will appear, and that there 
will be 85,000 deaths resulting from the disease. According to 
estimates, within the same period the government will spend $875 
million on patients in an advanced stage alone. Lair claimed 
that the government will attempt to reduce the infection levels 
over the next three years, based on a comprehensive AIDS control 
program financed by the World Bank. The program cost is $250 
million, with $90 million in matching funds from the Brazilian 
Government. 
  According to Lair Guerra, a striking feature in Brazil is 
the 
spread of the disease among various population groups, such as 
women and young people. The expert warned: "The use of 
injectable drugs is playing a preponderant role in the spread of 
the disease among the youth." In 1980, there were 28 cases among 
adolescents; and in 1991, 261 cases were recorded, with 50 
percent infected through drug use. During the government's 
informational campaign disseminated by radio and television, it 
had been planned to air a video instructing the drug user on how 
to disinfect needles and syringes, but the film was banned. Two 
films will be aired promoting the use of condoms, and there will 
be two radio spots providing information on the disease.

<HEAD>Brazilian Army Dynamites Clandestine Airstrips in Amazon Jungle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday began
dynamiting the first of 110 clandestine airstrips cut by gold
miners on Amazon jungle lands inhabited by the Yanomami Indians,
the world's largest primitive tribe.
   More than 250 army soldiers, air force officials and federal
police blew up the first airstrip Wednesday, a 600-yard runway in
the tropical rain forest near the Venezuelan and Guyanan borders.
   The military used 374 pounds of explosives to blast open 40
holes, each 13 feet in diameter and four feet deep, said Federal
Police spokesman Joao Martins.
   The rest of the airstrips will be destroyed before May 18 to
prevent the 40,000 prospectors from returning to Indian lands,
Martins said in a telephone interview.
   He said the work will cost $800,000.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello ordered the destruction of
the airstrips following a visit to the Yanomami reservation soon
after he took office on March 15.
   In addition to evacuating the miners, who first invaded the 1
million acre reserve in 1987, Collor promised to blow up the
illegal landing strips to stop planes from supplying the miners and
transporting gold and diamonds.
   Martins said two airstrips will be left intact for the National
Indian Foundation and the army, which maintains border outposts in
the region to combat drug trafficking and smuggling along Brazil's
4,000-mile northern frontier.
   He said troops seized one small plane loaded with cocaine on the
airstrip just before the dynamiting operation began. Police say
drug traffickers used the clandestine airstrips as transhipment
points between Colombia and Bolivia.
   The rush to Yanomami territory began three years ago after
government studies revealed the presence of gold, diamonds, tin and
bauxite in the region.
   Prospectors flocked to the area, leveling rain forests, chasing
off fish and game, polluting rivers with mercury used in gold
panning and spreading diseases previously unknown to the isolated
tribe.
   Since 1987, the tribe has dwindled from about 9,000 to 7,500,
due to malnutrition, venereal diseases and malaria. Others have
been killed in clashes with miners.
   Under international pressure, the government of former President
Jose Sarney announced a $4 million campaign in early January to
expel the prospectors, by force if necessary.
   There are about 220,000 native Indians left in Brazil, down from
an estimated 5 million when the Portuguese first landed here in
1500.
   The government has been steadily carving up Indian lands,
leaving the Yanomamis 19 scattered reservations totaling 5 million
acres in Brazil's northwest Amazon territory.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos MacArthur: "PF Lacks Money for Monitoring </F>
Amazon Region"] 
  [Text] The Federal Police [PF] need $248 million with which 
to carry out protective actions and stimulate sustainable 
development in the Amazon Region. The program's objectives 
include combating conflicts with Indians, land conflicts, the 
drug traffic, smuggling, and illegal mining. Since repression of 
those crimes is the exclusive duty of the Federal Police, that 
force's leadership is seeking external funds. 
  The Amazon Region is currently a genuine open border, 
according to Superintendent Mauro Sposito, because the PF's 
activity in the region is totally impaired by the lack of a 
surveillance, inspection, and monitoring system. For that 
reason, the superintendent points out, agents are being trained 
to work with experts from the Ministry of Communications in 
operating mobile radio stations that can trace conversations 
taking place in the region's isolated locations between the 
Colombian and Bolivian drug cartels. 
  The Federal Police are aware that the Amazon Region is 
currently the gateway through which drugs enter Brazil. The fact 
is that since the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1990, Brazil has 
become the preferred route for traffickers who once used the 
"Caribbean route." The lack of suitable equipment puts the PF at 
a disadvantage, and seizures do not exceed 5 percent of the 
total volume moving through the country. Sposito points out that 
in a survey by Interpol, it is estimated that the drug 
traffickers have annual revenues of $500 billion just from the 
sale of cocaine all over the world. 
  Because of the high prices generated by cocaine, the product 
has created a real chain of crime all around it, the 
superintendent explains. It is money from drug trafficking that 
finances kidnappings, auto thefts, smuggling, and even bank 
holdups. On that subject, the Federal Police draw a parallel by 
emphasizing that when an operation to repress key points in the 
drug traffic is intensified, the response by the gangs is almost 
immediate in the form of an increased number of bank holdups. 
"All one need do is remember that case in Rio de Janeiro where a 
joint operation was mounted by the PF and the Army. News of 
those operations and two raids by the Army in one of the 
shantytowns harmed the drug traffic, and two banks were held up 
right after that." 
  Federal Police officials say that the PF now has a wealth of 
information and maps concerning the activity of drug traffickers 
in the Amazon Region and even of illegal gold mines and other 
mines. 
<H5>  Tracking Crime </H5>
  Mapping work has made it possible to identify operators of 
illegal mines who join with drug traffickers to invade Indian 
lands. Once the Indians are evicted, both sides profit from the 
mining of minerals and the construction of clandestine landing 
strips. Approximately 90 percent of the gold produced in Brazil 
is smuggled out. 
  Pro-Amazon Region: By implementing the project scheduled for 
the start of 1994, Federal Police hope to reduce those crime 
levels considerably. The project calls for opening 54 police 
stations in the region over the next four years, hiring new 
agents, and providing the units with suitable equipment, as well 
as cooperating with international scientific communities in the 
fields of chemistry, biochemistry, botany, and animal husbandry. 
Beginning in January, the Advanced Training, Study, and Research 
Center in Manaus will receive 160 agents for training. 
  To speed up and debureaucratize its activities, the PF is 
going to divide the Amazon Region into three sections. One of 
the operational centers--in Manaus--will cover the states of 
Amazonas and Roraima. The center in Belem will be responsible 
for the states of Amapa and Maranhao, and the third center, in 
Porto Velho, will take care of Acre, Mato Grosso, and Rondonia. 
The PF's operations will also involve Ibama [Brazilian Institute 
for the Environment], Funai [National Indian Foundation], and 
Incra [National Land Reform and Settlement Institute].

   In a quiet, though dramatic,
reversal of policy, Brazil is now accepting foreign offers of help
to save the Amazon wilderness, the world's largest, from destruction.
   The government, which early this year rebuffed a United Nations
proposal to swap some of its $112-billion foreign debt for
investments in Amazon protection programs, recently told Britain and
West Germany it would work with them to curb damage, mostly by
burning, to the huge rain forest.
   In August, Brazil accepted Italian and Canadian planes for local
authorities to police the jungle. Then it said yes to a project
backed by the United Nations and by private American companies to
establish a 1.1 million-acre protected forest area to produce rubber
and nuts.
   The moves represent a sharp reversal in President Jose Sarney's
Amazon policy, which in the past considered offers by foreigners as
attempts to take control of the rain forest from Brazil.
   ``We cannot accept this form of colonialism which they want to
create here,'' Sarney told reporters in March, after France, the
Netherlands and two U.S. congressional delegations suggested trading
some Brazilian foreign debt, the Third World's largest, for Amazon
preservation.
   But analysts say subtle shifts in political, social and economic
spheres are forcing the government to change its mind.
   ``A bit of the persecution complex that took over the government,
which led to xenophobic and irrational behavior, is being overcome,
opening the road to new initiatives,'' wrote the Brazilian physicist
Jose Goldemberg in the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper recently.
   There is belief here that Sarney, widely discredited for his
inability to check 1,004 percent annual inflation, talked tough in
the past to placate right-wing supporters.
   But with his center-right Brazilian Democratic Movement Party in
splinters and the country's first popular presidential election
since 1960 set for Nov. 15, Sarney might now be resigned to accept
foreign aid, the analysts say.
   ``What you have is a lame-duck government that lacks the
legitimacy to start new initiatives and push them through
Congress,'' Rene Dreifuss, a political scientist at the Fluminense
University in Rio, told The Associated Press. ``It has no choice but
to accept help from abroad.''
   Equally important, the hostility marking the issue has undermined
Brazil's trade links abroad.
   ``It started to become taboo to do business in the Amazon,'' Sen.
Leopoldo Peres, a member of the Democratic Movement and president of
a Senate committee on Amazon deforestation, said in an interview.
``American and European banks and lending organizations started
hesitating on financing industrial projects in the jungle.''
   Environmentalists pressured the European Economic Community to
ban imports of iron ore produced at the Greater Carajas project, a
huge metallurgy project in Para, a state in the Amazon region.
   Recently, trade officials from Belgium, West Germany and Britain
visited the 200 million-acre, $70 billion project, where thousands
of acres of virgin forest southwest of the mouth of the Amazon River
are being burned for the charcoal needed to process ore.
   A Rio de Janeiro city councilman, Alfredo Sirkis of Brazil's
Green Party, contends Sarney first stiffened on the Amazon issue
under a barrage of international news coverage of the shooting death
of the acclaimed union leader and ecologist Francisco ``Chico''
Mendes.
   Mendes, who fought to keep cattle ranchers from cutting down the
forest for pasture, was killed last December outside his modest home
in a backwoods Amazon town.
   ``All of a sudden Chico was all over the front pages, and U.S.
senators were showing up to talk about saving the Amazon,'' Sirkis
said. ``It irritated the military, and Sarney reacted by turning it
into a sovereignty issue.''
   But the British rock star Sting met with Sarney in January and
received permission to begin a worldwide campaign to raise funds for
an Indian reservation.
   In February, Indian tribes of the eastern Amazon Basin organized
the first national tribal conference, with a goal of blocking World
Bank loans for a series of hydroelectric dams planned for the Amazon
region.
   These efforts added to a growing worldwide concern that
uncontrolled tree burning in the 2 million square-mile Amazon forest
_ for farming, ranching, highway building and mining _ was changing
global weather patterns.
   Environmentalists contend deforestation of the Amazon also is
destroying unique plant and animal life, much of it unstudied, and
eliminating a major source of oxygen for the Earth's atmosphere.
   Satellite surveys show that more than 5 percent of Brazil's rain
forest has been cut and burned. Some scientists say this adds carbon
to the atmosphere and helps cause the global warming trend known as
the greenhouse effect.
   By April, the first visible sign of change came when Sarney
announced a multimillion-dollar plan to preserve the rain forest.
   His ``Our Nature'' project extended the suspension of tax
incentives for ranchers and created a special police force to fight
the burning. It also established new forest and Indian reservations
and an Environmental Fund, banned timber exports, and controlled the
sale of mercury, which is indiscriminately dumped into Amazon-area
rivers by freelance gold prospectors.
   ``When the hysteria in the press and the government faded, the
nationalist jingo turned to apolitical dialogue,'' Flavio Feldmann
of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, a vocal ecology defender,
told a reporter.
   On July 5, Foreign Minister Roberto Abreu de Sodre signed a
memorandum of understanding with Britain to tackle ``urban and
industrial environmental problems, control of marine pollution, and
forestry management.''
   ``This cooperation does not affect the sovereign right of states
to administer their natural heritage,'' said Abreu de Sodre.
   In August, Brazil accepted $65.5 million in grants and loans from
West Germany for conservation projects in the Amazon over three
years.
   After this, the Inter-American Development Bank said it would
study the creation of a new fund for environmental projects in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
   Many Brazilian politicians now say the country will open up more
to foreign technological and financial help, although some seemingly
remain wary of the so-called ``sovereignty issue.''
   But Christopher Patten, Britain's minister of overseas
development, a recent visitor to Brazil, said, ``Environmental
problems are ... the world's problem, which has to be solved by
cooperation and not throwing bricks at each other.''

  [Text] The Venezuelan National Guard crossed into 
Brazilian territory in Roraima and arrested 32 miners working 
illegally in the Ianomami Indian reserve. 
  The majority of the miners were arrested on the 
Brazilian-Colombian border, near the Army battalion in Cucui. 
  Jose Altino Machado, director of the Legal Amazon Region 
Miners Union Association, said: The Brazilian miners were 
illegally arrested and taken to Puerto Ayacucho [Venezuela]. 
  The undefined markers on the Brazilian-Venezuelan border, 
manifested in the massacre of 16 Ianomami Indians in the Haximu 
area in August 1993, facilitated the invasion of Brazilian 
territory. 
  Jose Altino Machado said: The Venezuelan National Guard 
arrests the miners to steal their gold. 
  The miners were arrested last week and held in Puerto 
Ayacucho, located 400 km from the border, until 16 February.

  According to Senator Jose Richa, the idea is to wait and 
allow the government to reedit on 29 March the provisional 
measure with changes clarifying the date for salary conversions 
into URV. This will thus put a final end to the political 
crisis among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

  [Text] In the Venezuelan city of La Guaira, the presidents 
of Brazil and Venezuela released a joint communique this 
afternoon, confirming the two countries' goal of giving new 
impetus to their economic and political relations. 
  [Begin journalist Antonio Carlos Silva recording] At the 
official residence of La Guzmania here in La Guaira, 30 km from 
Caracas, the presidents of Brazil and Venezuela, Itamar Franco 
and Rafael Caldera respectively, released a joint communique 
this afternoon, confirming the two countries' political 
willingness to give new impetus 4o their bilateral relations. 
As part of this effort, they decided to form a bilateral 
commission, chaired by the foreign ministers of the two 
countries, to raise common issues. This commission will form 
work groups to design projects in the electrical, highway, 
hydrographical, mining, iron and steel, and environmental fields. 
  The presidents of Brazil and Venezuela proposed that the 
ministers involved in the commercial area speed up the 
preparations for signing an economic accord. 
  They discussed the Brazilian proposal to create a free trade 
zone, without excluding other current regional integration 
mechanisms, and decided to continue their talks on this issue. 
  The two presidents also proposed discussing ways to increase 
Brazilian purchases of Venezuelan oil. They agreed to promote 
efforts to develop the border areas, especially the Indian 
communities. 
  The joint communique was released at 1230 today after a 
two-hour meeting between the two presidents. 
  Presidents Itamar Franco and Rafael Caldera had lunch 
together and President Itamar Franco then had a free afternoon. 
He is scheduled to return to Brasilia on 5 March. [end 
recording] 
  President Itamar Franco confirmed that by converting wages 
into URV's [Real Value Units], they will not lose their value. 
Therefore, he believes that the mechanism proposed by Congress 
for adjusting wages against inflation is unnecessary. 
  Following the release of the joint communique, President 
Itamar Franco held a news conference during which he criticized 
the activities of oligopolies in Brazil and expressed hope that 
Congress will improve the provisional measure as far as 
oligopolies are concerned. Concerning wage policies, he asked 
that the negotiations be conducted at the ministries and the 
respective business sectors [camaras setoriais]. 
  President Itamar Franco said the government has nothing to 
hide. Therefore, there is no reason for the workers to strike 
when the authorities are open to dialogue. The president added 
that if the workers demonstrate that the wages are actually 
losing their value, the government will obviously take this fact 
into account. 
  Itmar Franco noted that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso's departure from the government, if it occurs, will not 
hurt the management of the economic program that interests the 
entire country, not just the government.

<F P=106> [Article by Kristina Michaelles] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo -- With a single pen stroke Brazil may be 
throwing away the equivalent of $18 million which had been 
earmarked for the demarcation of indigenous reservations, and 
wasting three and a half years of difficult negotiations, as the 
funds have already been approved by the German Government. 
According to Environment Ministry figures for February, the 
Brazilian Government has already spent $84,000 on technical 
missions for negotiating this project. 
  The request for the exclusion of the indigenous reservations 
project is contained in a letter sent by the Foreign Ministry to 
the German Government on 23 February. In the letter, the 
Foreign Ministry suggests modifications in the memorandum about 
bilateral participation within the framework of the Pilot 
Program for the Preservation of Brazilian Tropical Forests, 
which totals 68 million German marks ($40 million). The 
Indigenous Reservations Demarcation project had already been 
approved by an interministerial commission to which the Foreign 
Ministry also belongs. 
<H5>  Protest </H5>
  The fax sent to the Germans has elicited a strong protest 
from Dinarte Nobre de Medeiros, president of Funai [National 
Indian Foundation], who defined the Foreign Ministry decision as 
"inappropriate and untimely." In a fax sent on 3 March to the 
Environment Ministry, which is responsible for negotiating the 
overall Pilot Program, Medeiros said: "We would be entirely 
paralyzed as far as the regularization of indigenous territories 
is concerned." 
  The Brazilian Government's refusal to accept money from 
abroad for the demarcation of indigenous lands has taken place 
only a few days before the 20 March meeting to be held in 
Brussels. The main donors of funds for the Pilot Program (the 
World Bank, the Group of Seven wealthy countries, and the 
European Union) will participate in the Brussels meeting. This 
refusal could irreversibly affect other projects in the program. 
  Roberto Smeraldi, who coordinates Amazon region matters for 
the organization Friends of the Earth, said: "This is a serious 
matter, because the Germans are the main financial backers of 
the Pilot Program for the Amazon Region, and this attitude could 
end up damaging Brazil in the eyes of the other donors." In his 
opinion the consequences of this attitude regarding the Pilot 
Program could be "unthinkable." 
  The Indigenous Rights Nucleus, Friends of the Earth, and the 
Amazon Region Work Group have already sent a joint letter to 
German and Brazilian authorities warning them about the unusual 
unilateral decision made by the Foreign Ministry. 
<H5>  Battle </H5>
  The Foreign Ministry fax reveals that there is a hard battle 
going on inside government between the sector opposing the use 
of foreign resources for the demarcation of Indian lands, in the 
name of national sovereignty, and those who did their best to 
obtain foreign help to compensate for the budget cutbacks 
conducted a few weeks ago, which have practically eliminated the 
resources earmarked for the demarcation of indigenous lands. Of 
the $39 million requested by Funai, only $1.8 million (5 percent 
of the overall amount requested) was approved by the Federal 
Government Budget Department. 
  This is one more chapter preceding the political-juridical 
battle over the constitutional revision process. There are 
already 232 proposals and amendments related to Indians' rights. 
Some of them even seek to prevent the demarcation of indigenous 
lands on the border strip, where nearly 200 reservations are 
located.

possibility of a coup in Brazil. There is no risk of 
Fujimorization in Brazil, the minister said, noting that 
President Itamar Franco has already said everything that had to 
be said on the subject. 
  The military ministers had thought about releasing a note 
denying the statements by Justice Minister Mauricio Correa. The 
ministers, however, preferred not to promote greater controversy
