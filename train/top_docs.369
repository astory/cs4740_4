<LEADPARA>  The Canadian government and leaders of Eskimos in the central and eastern
Arctic reached agreement Monday on a massive land claim settlement that would
divide the Northwest Territories and create a sprawling new territory called
Nunavut whose size would exceed that of California and Alaska combined.;  
Under the agreement, the 17,000 Eskimos in the region would be granted
self-government rights over part of the new territory and would become the
biggest landowners in North America. The Eskimos also would retain hunting,
fishing and other rights elsewhere in Nunavut, a 772,000-square-mile expanse
partly administered by federal authorities that would represent a fifth of
Canada's total land mass.  </LEADPARA>

SETTLEMENT WILL SPLIT NORTHWEST TERRITORIES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The accord is subject to approval by the Canadian Parliament and a
plebiscite among all 52,000 people living in the Northwest Territories.;  
Under the redrawing of the Canadian map, the Eskimos would take legal title to
136,000 square miles of disputed land stretching from the Manitoba border to
the North Pole. They also would receive nearly $1 billion over 14 years,
including interest payments.;   In return, the Eskimos would relinquish title
claims to about 80 percent of their ancestral land, including areas believed
to contain lucrative oil and gas fields. But they would retain some governing
rights in that area.;   The region covered by the agreement consists mostly of
frozen tundra and wilderness islands of the Arctic archipelago. Eighty percent
of the population is Eskimo. The land claim settlement, the biggest in
Canada's history, was announced in Ottawa by Native Affairs Minister Thomas
Siddon and leaders of the Tengavik Federation of Nunavut, the political
organization of Arctic Eskimos, also known as Inuit.;   The two sides agreed
to negotiate a formal political accord creating the territory of Nunavut and
establishing the terms of its financing. Nunavut -- "Land of the People" in
the Inuit language -- would join the Yukon and the Northwest Territories as
the third of Canada's nominally self-governing territories without provincial
status.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The likely creation of a huge new Arctic territory for Eskimos marks a
watershed in Canada's efforts to address the many longstanding grievances of
its native peoples.;   But the prospect of the new realm has pitted Canada's
various aboriginal peoples against each other, as they argue over how best to
achieve their ultimate goal: self-government.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CANADA'S NATIVES DIVIDED ON PLAN FOR NEW TERRITORY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Stephen Hazell, executive director of the Canadian Arctic Resources
Committee, called the agreement a "shining star," and said Tuesday that it was
"one of the better achievements of the federal government.";   But A.J. Felix,
head of the Prince Albert Tribal Council, an Indian group, called it "a very
black day," and worried that "the government of Canada could unilaterally deny
the rights of one group of people by claiming to recognize the rights of
another group of people." He said the Tribal Council planned to go to court
before Christmas to block the deal for the Eskimos.;   The prospect of new
lands for the Inuit, as Canadian Eskimos prefer to be called, loomed large
this week, when the Canadian government and an Inuit negotiating team
announced Monday that they had reached a huge land-claims settlement after 16
years of talks.;   If all goes as planned, Canada will split its existing
Northwest Territories in two, and create an Inuit territory called Nunavut,
which means "Our Land" in Inuktitut, the language of the eastern Arctic.;  
Nunavut would be enormous -- 772,000 square miles -- bigger than Alaska and
California combined, covering a fifth of Canada's total landmass. The 17,000
Inuit who live in its frozen, barren wastes would eventually govern
themselves.;   The settlement calls for the Inuit to own 136,000 square miles
of Nunavut outright, and to extinguish their claims to the rest of the land,
while retaining fishing and hunting rights throughout the territory. They
would also receive nearly $1 billion over 14 years, including more than $10
million in training funds, so they will be able to administer their own
territorial government.;   But Nunavut is not a done deal. "There's still
quite a lot of uncertainty" surrounding the accord, said Jim Bell, a writer
with the Nunatsiaq News, the newspaper in Iqaluit, a town of 3,200 at the
southern tip of Baffin Island that would probably become the territorial
capital if Nunavut becomes a reality.;   A major stumbling point is the
objection of Indians in the Western Arctic to Nunavut's proposed boundaries.
The Indians and Inuit have hunted and trapped across overlapping regions of
Northern Canada for millenniums; Indians say some lands designated for Nunavut
are theirs.;   The Inuit and the Indians will be able to vote on the
boundaries in a Northwest Territories plebiscite scheduled for March 16.
Observers say the vote could be close.;   "I think it will be a rough ride,
because the Dene and the Metis don't agree with the boundaries that are being
imposed," said Jack Anawak, Canada's only Eskimo member of Parliament. The
Dene nation is made up of half a dozen Indian tribes in the Western Arctic and
sub-Arctic; Metis are peoples of mixed Indian and white lineage.;   "If the
plebiscite on the boundary fails," Bell said, "then the whole thing could fall
apart."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Soviet Eskimos Take Part in Arctic Gathering for First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arctic Eskimos from Alaska in the
west to Siberia in the east met in Greenland on Monday to discuss
common cultural and ecological problems.
   It was the first time a Soviet delegation attended a general
assembly of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, a non-governmental
umbrella organization for Inuit, or Eskimos, from Alaska, Canada,
Greenland and Soviet Union.
   About 450 Inuit were expected take part in the west Greenland
township of Sisimuit.
   A 10-man delegation, which is attending as an observer, says it
represents native Siberians known as Yuit.
   ``Even though President Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika has
reached areas of the Soviet Union where the 1,600 Yuit live, there
are many problems we would like to discuss with the ICC,''
delegation leader Nadesjda Utke said during a stopover in
Copenhagen.
   ``We want to exchange experiences in maintaining traditional
hunting and implements, educational materials and greater
participation by the local people in decision-making,'' she said.
   The fifth general assembly was being held under the motto ``A
Celebration of Inuit Unity,'' to mark the first Soviet
participation. It was opened by the current Conference President,
Mary Simon of Canada.
   Topics for discussion during the five-day gathering included
environment and renewable resources, promotion of Inuit rights
internationally and transboundry pollution of the Arctic.
   A series of workshops were set up to study and report back on
such specialized topics as Arctic peace and security, whaling, the
``anti-harvesting'' conservation movement's impact on traditional
hunting, Inuit culture, land use and costal zone management.
   About 40,000 Inuit live in Greenland, 28,000 in Alaska and
11,000 in Canada. The Soviet Inuits comprise a small part of the
150,000 natives of the Siberian north.
   Greenland, the world's biggest island and a former colony of
Denmark, this summer celebrates its tenth year with homerule-style
local government.

   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government agreed to recognize
native ownership of a vast tract of northern land extending
to the North Pole.
   The new jurisdiction, to be called Nunavut (Land of the
People), is the eastern region of what is now the Northwest
Territories.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government said legislation will be introduced next
year to give the natives title to about 136,000 square miles
of land. The new region's 17,500 Inuit (Eskimos) account for
about 80% of its total population.
   The agreement would provide the Inuit with mineral rights
to about 14,000 square miles. The area is thought to have
considerable oil and natural gas and mineral potential.
   Inuit president Louis Pilakapsi called it a "fair
settlement."
   The Canadian government will maintain a regulatory role
over portions of the new territory. An Inuit board will be
established to ensure Inuit participation in regulating the
land. "We welcome industry to come in and do business with
us," an Inuit spokesman said.
   As part of the land claim settlement, the government also
agreed to give the area's inhabitants 580 million Canadian
dollars (US$507.5 million) over 14 years. In return, the
Inuit agreed to give up their claims to any other land in the
Northwest Territories.
   Negotiations are to begin soon on what powers the new
government will have. A final agreement is expected to be
reached in April. Elections are to be held later.

   Eskimos from four nations, guarding a
tradition of hunting and fur trading, criticized animal
conservationists for threatening the culture of Arctic people.
   Rosemarie Kuptana, vice president of the Inuit Circumpolar
Conference, urged delegates to force environmentalists and animal
conservationists ``to answer our arguments,'' the Greenland
newspaper Information reported Friday.
   ``Our opponents are much weeker when it is we who set the
agenda,'' Ms. Kuptana, a Canadian, told the 500 Inuit delegates at
a conference's meeting in Sisimuit, West Greenland.
   It was the first time a Soviet delegation attended a general
assembly of the conference, a non-governmental organization for
Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Soviet Union.
   Anger is growing among Arctic natives toward conservationist
groups such as Greenpeace, whose campaigns the Eskimos say have
damaged hunting and the fur trade.
   ``It never ceases to amaze me how people can react so strongly
against traditional hunting on the part of a little group of
indigenous people _ people who during thousands of years of hunting
never have threatened a single animal species _ while at the same
time industrialized society has polluted the planet to such a
degree that there is no way back,'' Ms. Kuptana said.
   Greenpeace's Kirsten Sander, who attended the conference as an
observer, admitted that the group's campaign against seal skins in
recent years had done unintended harm to Inuit hunters.
   To counter future anti-harvesting campaigns, the conference
unveiled a far-reaching Inuit conservation strategy.
   This policy, largely the initiative of conference members from
Canada and Greenland, embraces all aspects of environmental concern
in the Arctic.
   Peter Jull, a former Inuit adviser to the Canadian government,
said the document calls for detailed research on the environment
and wildlife, including all species that Inuits depend on for food
and clothing.
   He said the plan was partly ``an expression that the environment
is our interest and not just for the benefit of companies down
south somewhere.''
   The conference also compiled a guide of policy principles on
issues including nuclear power, education and self-government for
use at the regional and local levels.
   ``What we're basically saying is that we live in the Arctic and
we know what happens when you mess it up,'' Jull said.
   About 40,000 Inuit live in Greenland, 28,000 in Alaska and
11,000 in Canada. The Soviet Inuit comprise a small part of the
150,000 natives of the Siberian north.

   When Simon Tookoome began selling his drawings in the late 1960s, he was lucky to command $5 or $10 each. 
Today, the 55-year-old Canadian Eskimo routinely sells each drawing through his local cooperative at Baker Lake, in Canada's Arctic, for $300 or more. 

   Many Canadian Eskimos (or Inuit, as they call themselves) once earned a living mainly by hunting and trapping. 
Today, they are thriving as artists, some earning in excess of $100,000 annually. 

   A whalebone drummer by Inuk David Atchealak fetched over $37,000 at a recent art auction at Waddington's in Toronto, the highest price reportedly ever paid for an Inuit work. 
Corporations such as Toronto Dominion Bank and Rothman's Inc. boast large Inuit art collections. 
And Amway Corp.'s Japanese subsidiary recently put up $1 million to sponsor an exhibit by Inuit artists that opened in New York in June. 

   The Inuit artists are prospering because they are using modern business methods to solve their core problem: the producing and marketing of art in the far-flung Arctic. 
They own and operate small co-op businesses that collect their work and sell it to "southern" dealers and buyers in North America and abroad. 

   As such, the Inuit experience may serve as a guide to other groups trying to profit from ethnic arts and crafts. 
Indeed, American Indian groups seem to have enjoyed their biggest commercial success when they went the co-op route. 
And the success stories have begun attracting investors, most notably big Japanese financial houses, including Daiwa Securities Corp. 

   It is the all-encompassing nature of the 1980s-style cooperatives that has made them effective. 
They don't just peddle art. 
They stockpile raw material for the artists for the cold winter months when the region is impassable. 
They collect key data on prices and market trends and act as auditors and bookkeepers. 
Regularly, they organize workshops to help artists with new design ideas and new media. 
And, in the beginning, by regulating production and the quality of prints, they also helped maintain a high level of prices. 

   But success also has hurt the Inuit co-ops. 
Many of the top artists they helped establish have defected, choosing to deal directly with galleries and potential buyers. 
"Why do I need to sell to the co-op when I can get a better deal from the south?" asks Bart Hanna, a Inuk sculptor from Igloolik in Canada's Northwest Territories. 

   Some see so much commercial exploitation that the purity of the art form has been tarnished. 
Still others decry the growing layers of bureaucracy. 
Says Alma Houston, who helped start Cape Dorset -- one of the first co-ops -- on Canada's Baffin Island in 1961: "Some of them have gotten too pedestrian, they lack imagination." 
If the co-ops are going to successfully fend off competitors, the artists will have to once again be involved in the co-op and new marketing ideas will have to be found. 
If the co-ops want to continue as leaders in promoting and selling Inuit art, she says, "they will have to smarten up." 

   Still, "without the co-ops, Inuit art wouldn't be as well-known as it is today," says Gunther Abrahamson in Ottawa, a retired government official who helped develop the first Arctic co-ops. 

   Nor, possibly, would there be thriving art industries in other native American cultures. 
Today, cooperative businesses owned and operated by artists are playing a pivotal role in marketing the art of tribal artists all across North America. 

   "Cooperatives not only have facilitated the sale of works of art by native Americans, they also have created a forum where the traditions and styles of native American art can be handed down from generation to generation," says Halsey North, a New York art-group consultant. 

   In Cherokee, N.C., for example, Qualla Arts &amp; Crafts Mutual Inc., sells the work of nearly 300 Eastern Cherokee artists and craftsmen through a retail store and a mail-order catalog. 
And in addition to buying $15,000 to $20,000 of work from many artists, it also mails to each artist two dividend checks each year, amounting to about 5% of their total sales. 

   Qualla, which began operating in 1946, earns most of its revenue from its store in Cherokee, selling items like arrowhead ash trays that cost $4 and sculpture priced at $900. 
The items are also marketed through a mail-order catalog: 30,000 or so were mailed in the past three years. 
In addition, the co-op sells the art work at state fairs and exhibitions and represents artists in dealing with commercial buyers. 
For the Cherokee, most of whom prefer a rural, isolated existence, "the art couldn't have been sold without the co-op," George Holt of the North Carolina Arts Council says. 

   In Alaska, artists' co-ops have successfully bridged the problem of distance and fragmented markets, adds Jean Flanagan Carlo of the Institute of Alaska Native Arts, Fairbanks, Alaska. 
Two or three times a year, the co-ops sweep through the state providing raw materials, such as stone and fabric, and buying work to sell to buyers in the cities. 
Says Ms. Carlo, "None of the artists have the resources to do this on their own." 
Nowhere did artists need co-ops more than in the Arctic. 
The Inuit live in scattered settlements, days of travel away from each other and far from their markets. 
And in the early days, there was no market to speak of. 
Says Mr. Tookoome: "I had to sell to anyone and take any price they would give me." 

   The promotion of Inuit handicrafts began when the Canadian Handicrafts Guild sent Ms. Houston, a teacher, and her husband, Jim Houston, an art collector, to the north to encourage development of local industries among the Eskimos. 
The two established Cape Dorset's co-op with the help of the government and local Inuit artists. 

   Among the first accomplishments of co-ops like Cape Dorset was to develop a system for producing and selling art. 
Traditionally, each artist would sail up to the quarries and bring back, at most, two or three stones for carving. 
If the weather was bad or the rivers froze, they wouldn't travel at all. 
To remedy the problem, the co-op rented large 40-foot boats and brought back enough stones for a season. 
As for buying work, the co-ops were open year-round, a sharp contrast to the days when a potential buyer would appear maybe once a year. 
"We created a stable market," says Ms. Houston. 

   By the mid 1960s, the 30-or-so Arctic co-ops asked the Canadian government for help in organizing a central marketing system. 
In response, the government established Canadian Arctic Producers and financed its early operations. 
But it wasn't until the 1970s that the marketing group began to have an impact. 
By that time, notes Bill Lyall, a senior marketing official, "we had established a regular channel of distribution and a group of dealers aggressively promoting Inuit art."

<TEXT>
   The two whales that captured the world's attention
off Alaska should have been eaten instead of freed from the ice, an
Eskimo activist says.
   ``In my mind, there's something wrong to save these two whales
while you are destroying the life of the human beings of the
North,'' Aqqaluk Lynge, of the Greenland office of the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference, said Friday at a news conference that
concluded a three-day meeting on arctic cooperation.
   ``To my mind it's a degradation of human values,'' he said.
   The native peoples of the Arctic region generally prefer the term
Inuit to Eskimo.
   The California gray whales, stranded in arctic ice for nearly
three weeks, apparently swam to freedom Friday, ending a
million-dollar rescue effort that involved Soviet icebreakers,
American scientists and Eskimo volunteers who cut holes in the ice
with chain saws.
   Lynge noted the enormous resources devoted to freeing the whales
and said, ``It's better to eat them.''
   The activist said environmentalists' campaigns against
fur-trapping and seal hunting in the arctic have devastated
traditional cultures in the region.
   The conference, sponsored by the government-affiliated Canadian
Institute for International Peace and Security and the
Toronto-based, private Science for Peace, brought together native
activists as well as scientists and academics on arctic issues.
   Organizers of the International Conference on Arctic Cooperation
said the participation among all arctic nations, including the
Soviet Union, was remarkable.
   Arkady Cherkasov, a specialist in arctic economics from the
Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of the USA and Canada, said
the campaign to save the two whales may have helped because of the
attention focused on the region's problems.
   ``It's a good thing,'' he said. ``But still there are many other
problems to solve in the north.''
   Cherkasov also said the Yuit people of the Soviet Arctic might be
able to join the Inuit Interpolar Conference. A representative of
the Yuits, who have traveled only rarely outside the Soviet Union,
was in Toronto for the conference.
   The interpolar conference claims to represent the 120,000 Inuit
people from Alaska, Canada and Greenland.
   But Cherkasov said Soviet participation in such a group could be
difficult because more than 25 different native groups live in the
Soviet Arctic.
   The 70 participants were from eight arctic countries, including
Canada, the Soviet Union, the United States, Denmark (Greenland),
Iceland, Sweden, Finland and Norway.
   Although they failed to agree on a final resolution, organizer
Franklyn Griffiths of the University of Toronto said the conference
produced thinking ``about what you can do up there together. Action
comes later.''
   Among the topics discussed were public health problems in the
arctic region, the results of industrialization, the environment and
the greenhouse effect, militarization and science.
   ``Each polar state now faces broadly similar problems preserving
the cultures and way of life of its indigenous peoples,'' the
conference's preliminary statement said.
   ``While the need for international civil cooperation on Arctic
environmental, scientific, social and other matters of common
concern has grown, it is constrained by military-strategic
conflict.''

   U.S. military authorities restricted
the movements of a Soviet delegation taking part in an Eskimo
conference, participants were told Tuesday.
   The U.S. military told the 18 Soviet delegates to remain in
their hotel during a Sunday night stop at Soendre Stroemfjord, a
U.S. base in Greenland, said the Soviets and the conference
president. Delegates from Alaska and Canada were allowed to move
around the base.
   Canadian Mary Simon, president of the Inuit Circumpolar
Conference, said the incident was unfortunate.
   ``The Soviets are equal participants in our congress and should
have been treated that way. ''
   The Soviets are attending the conference for the first time. The
other delegates are from Canada, Alaska and Greenland. The 500
participants represent the world's more than 100,000 Arctic natives.
   Tuesday was the second day of the weeklong conference, being
held in Sisimiut, a town of 5,000 people on Greenland's east coast.
   Ms. Simon, an Inuit from Quebec, told the conference that
self-government remains a vitally important question for the Inuit
_ or Eskimo _ people.
   Greenland has enjoyed home rule since 1979. But in Canada, the
issue is one of acute concern, and negotiations with the Canadian
government are proceeding slowly, Ms. Simon said.
   In Alaska, the Native Land Claims Settlement of 1971 did nothing
to address the issue of self-government, she said.

Trio Holdings, David Hagan's money-broking outfit, is hardly a household
name so only an alert merchant banker would have spotted the new competition
on the block. A bunch of Canadian Inuits is helping underwrite Trio's Pounds
6.5m rights issue.
Don't laugh - Hagan could be on to something. Inuvialuit Investments (II),
which is co-underwriting the issue, helps invest the loot of Canada's Inuit
people. The Inuit have come into tons of money in recent years thanks to
payments from the federal government to settle long-standing land claims.
The Inuit in the eastern half of the Northwest Territories, for example, won
a land-claims settlement last year that will net them almost CDollars 1.2bn
over 14 years. Royalties from mines and oil and gas wells in the Northwest
Territories are likely to swell their coffers still further.
Trio's newfound underwriter is based high above the Arctic Circle and is the

<LEADPARA>  The Canadian government in Ottawa has tentatively awarded the Inuit people of
northern Canada with rights to an area of land five times the size of
California, a minister said today. The settlement divides in two Canada's
Northwest Territories and ends 15 years of talks on the Inuit's claim to vast
portions of the land they have lived in for thousands of years. The government
recognizes their right to the land in principal, but will give up only some of
it.;   Under the weekend agreement, the Inuit will receive $580 million ($522
million U.S.) over 14 years, along with the right to hunt, fish and trap
anywhere in a new territory to be known as Nunavut, an area of 740,000 square
miles, and title to 135,000 square miles of that land. Nunavut -- which will
be cut off from the eastern half of the Northwest Territories -- is about the
size of Newfoundland and Labrador, and about five times the size of California.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>
     this remote outpost,
Bezal and Terry Jesudason sometimes worry when their guests
leave their snug little tourist home to go on excursions.
   Lately they have been making radio contact with a guest who checked out early last month for a 600-mile walk across the Arctic ice to Greenland. 
By satellite they keep in touch with other customers who are trekking by snowmobile and motorcycle to the North Pole, 1,050 miles away. 

   "The people that finally come this far north are very special, and we can't help but worry about them as individuals," Terry Jesudason says. 
Her "most fearful moment" was in 1982 when a chartered plane sank through the ice and left a group of shivering tourists stranded near the pole. 
Luckily the weather was good, and a backup plane rescued the group within a few hours. 

   Bezal Jesudason (pronounced BAY-z'l jay-zoo-DAH-s'n) is a small, dark, enthusiastic immigrant from steamy south India, but he can build an igloo, skin a seal and speak the language of the Inuit, Canada's Eskimos. 
While his wife looks after their six-room International Explorer's Home, he leads packaged adventure tours across the ice to such unlikely destinations as the north magnetic pole. 

   "I'd be more afraid to be run over or mugged in New York than to walk around in the Arctic," Mr. Jesudason says, but he disapproves when guests like Japanese hiker Mitsuro Oba insist on traveling alone. 

   "Oba-san, many dangers!" 
Mr. Jesudason warns, pantomiming an angry bear for his Greenland-bound customer, who doesn't speak much English. 
Mr. Jesudason says that Mr. Oba's supply of seal meat will lure polar bears from a dozen miles away, possibly when he is asleep. 
But Mr. Oba, who once floated down the Amazon on a homemade raft, seems to think bear trouble will help his career as a professional adventurer. 
"Nice pictures," he replies, clicking an imaginary camera at his host's imaginary bear. 

   Resolute is one of the harshest places on earth. 
Winter temperatures reach 60 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. 
Snow falls in August. 
The only civilian settlement on the continent that is farther north is a little Inuit village on Ellesmere Island named Grise Fiord. 
That is where Bezal, now 46, met Terry, now 38. 

   Mr. Jesudason, a mechanical engineer, had recently immigrated to Canada when he signed up in 1969 for a federal job maintaining electric-power plants in the Arctic. 
"I didn't even know that there weren't any trees up here," he recalls. 
He hunted seal and caribou with his Inuit neighbors and grew to love the life. 

   Mrs. Jesudason was adventurous in a different way. 
A Canadian, she was working as a secretary in her native British Columbia when neighbors returned from a geologic assignment in the Arctic. 
They told her about the difficulties that Inuit-speaking children faced in English-language schools when they entered the first grade. 
So she paid her own way to Grise Fiord and used her savings to set up its first kindergarten. 

   The couple soon met, and they married in 1971. 
Most residents of the high Arctic rent their homes from the government, but the Jesudasons built the first private house in Grise Fiord. 
There was no hotel there then, so the community's few visitors took to staying with the gregarious young couple. 
One frequent guest was Japanese adventurer Naomi Uemura, who in 1978 revived world-wide interest in polar travel by making the first one-man expedition to the North Pole. 

   Not long after that, when Mr. Jesudason was showing home movies of outdoor life with the Inuit, several tourists told him Americans would pay to go on such wilderness adventures. 
He soon quit his government job and formed High Arctic International Explorer Services Ltd. to run snowmobile and camping expeditions out of Resolute, the northernmost point in Canada with regular jet service-four flights a week. 
He and his wife bought two abandoned village houses here and nailed them together into a modest home with several extra bedrooms. 

   "We thought we'd just do our own trips and accommodate our own guests," Mrs. Jesudason says, "but because this is the transport center of the Arctic we started getting scientists and media people and independent expeditions." 
Soon the territorial government insisted the Jesudasons get a tourist-home license. 

   The license was an early sign of what the Jesudasons see as the baleful descent of big-city bureaucracy on one of the world's last frontiers. 
"You couldn't afford to stay here," Mrs. Jesudason says, if she and her husband provided, and heated, the minimum amount of living space that regulations require for each guest. 
She won't put an "exit" sign on her kitchen door, either. 
Not homey enough. 

   The Jesudasons charge about $74 a day for room and board. 
"From February to September we make a profit and we live off our fat for the rest of the year," Mr. Jesudason says. 
When 24-hour darkness covers Resolute in midwinter, the Jesudasons go on a long vacation someplace warmer. 
They have been several times to Mr. Jesudason's sweltering hometown of Madras. 
"Such a beautiful climate," says his wife. 

   Before the sun returns to Resolute, in February, Mr. Jesudason begins building sleds and recruiting Inuit guides for the season's visitors. 
His wife starts making her grocery list; she will have about 12,000 pounds of canned goods, soap and sundries on the annual ship that calls here in late summer. 
It costs about 59 cents a pound to fly in anything she forgets, or fresh lettuce for a salad. 
She pays more than $2 a quart for milk, about $2.60 for a dozen eggs. 

   Food from Mrs. Jesudason's cheerful white-and-yellow kitchen runs toward hearty beef and potatoes, occasionally enlivened with her musk-ox stew or Mr. Jesudason's Indian curry. 
Guests sometimes have to share their rooms with strangers, and there are no private baths. 
Three expeditions to the North Pole are booked into the guest house this season. 

   The guests can be fascinating. 
Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, has stayed here. 
So has Sir Edmund Hillary, conqueror of Mount Everest. 
Mrs. Jesudason corresponds with former guests in 40 countries. 
With friends in every time zone, she has to take the telephone off the hook at night to get some sleep. 

   Mr. Jesudason doesn't take his own tour groups as far as the North Pole, but he provides equipment, hot showers and the benefit of his long experience to adventurers who are headed there. 
"Any of the expeditions going up there use him as logistics master," says Richard Hamburg, a tourism official with the territorial government and a 20-year Arctic veteran. 
"If he doesn't know about it, nobody does." 

   Need an Eskimo guide, a hunting rifle or a heated workshop for repairing a dog sled? 
Mr. Jesudason has all that. 
How about a knapsack-sized satellite navigation beacon that reports your precise location to his personal computer, by way of a U.S. weather satellite and a scientific agency in France? 
Most polar expeditions rent one from Mr. Jesudason, then call him every day by radio to find out where they are on the featureless Arctic Ocean. 

   "If you combine 20th-century technology and Inuit culture," Mr. Jesudason says of the boom in North Pole expeditions, "you can bring any kind of dream to life." 

   But he sees more bureaucratic snakes in his frozen Eden. 
There is a campaign afoot to change local place names from English to Inuit, so that Resolute could become Qausuittuq or maybe Kaujuitoq. 
And the federal and territorial governments plan to establish the world's northernmost national park on Ellesmere Island, where Mr. Jesudason runs expensive camping trips. 

   "The government doesn't understand that the kind of people who come here want to feel they are walking where nobody stepped before," Mr. Jesudason complains. 
"They won't come if they see footpaths and a sign saying 'Welcome to Our National Park.'" 

   And Qausuittuq? 
"I'll fight it all the way," he says. 
"Nobody will come to a place they can't spell or pronounce."

<TEXT>
   Most of its 870,240 square miles is covered with ice 2{ miles
thick, but the ice-free area is still half the size of Texas.
   The southern coasts are snowless and verdant in summer, and it
was here that the Scandinavian Vikings landed 1,000 years ago and
gave the country its somewhat misleading name.
   Eric the Red, a hero of Icelandic sagas, established tiny
colonies that eked out a living for 500 years before mysteriously
dying out.
   Nuuk sits on a long strip of land between two fiords, with
mountains rising on either side like sentinels. Long rows of
publicly built five-story apartment blocks give the city an air of
drabness.
   Today four out of five inhabitants are native Inuits, who are
related by language and custom to the Eskimos of Alaska, Canada and
Siberia.
   But 60 percent of the country's administration is run by Danes.
   Jonathan Motzfeldt, who has been prime minister since autonomy
was granted, says the goal is for Greenlanders to take over
entirely. In its first autonomous decade, he says, ``Greenland
already has undergone a silent revolution,'' and he wants it to
become more self-reliant.
   Motzfeldt has announced deep cuts in social benefits, especially
to the unemployed. From now on, he says, welfare clients who refuse
a job offer in the summer will not be eligible for cash benefits.
   The Greenland government also has taken its first international
loan of about $166 million, in German marks and Japanese yen.
   Denmark's rule over Greenland dates to 1776, when it set up a
trade monopoly and established missionary stations along the coast.
   The Americans came during World War II, when Greenland was a
midway staging area and refueling stop for troop transports and
equipment on the way to the European theater.
   U.S. forces also supplied the Greenlanders with food and
essentials after the Nazis occupied Denmark, which old-timers still
remember.
   In the early 1950s the U.S. military built defense installations
across Canada, Greenland, Iceland and Scotland known as the Distant
Early Warning System, or DEW Line.
   The philosophy then was that the shortest distance between two
superpowers, as the bomber or ballistic missile flies, is over the
arctic. But the stations have become outdated and are coming down.
   The U.S. pullout from Sondre Stromfjord also is exacerbating
tensions with Greenland over the Thule radar base, an important
link for U.S. defenses in its ballistic missile warning system.
   Thule was once a tiny Inuit hunting and trapping village. Under
the U.S.-Danish Defense Agreement of 1951, the U.S. military
relocated the native people and built a big phased-array radar.
   It has been a bone of contention between the United States and
the Soviet Union, which claims the modernization of Thule in recent
years was a breach of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty.
   Though it is a source of income for Greenland, it is a political
embarrassment for Motzfeldt, who is under pressure from leftists
who want to get rid of the base. Motzfeldt grumbles about Thule as
``that stupid radar.''
   Denmark, mindful of its commitments to NATO, supports the U.S.
position that Thule is ``non-offensive,'' and the Greenland
administration has little choice but to fall in line.
   Motzfeldt has intimated that the Americans won't be welcome in
Thule unless they agree to continue paying for Sondre Stromfjord's
civilian airport.
   ``We are not going to pay money to have the American bases
here,'' Motzfeldt says. ``On the contrary, we insist that civilian
people have the advantage of the Americans' presence.''
   Despite all of its problems, the latest news of the gold find
should help make the future brighter. For the first Christmas in a
long time, the world can truly say, ``Yes, Greenland, there is a
Santa Claus.''

<HEAD>Natives to Take on Anti-Fur Movement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL SPENCER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Native people of the north are
preparing to take on the anti-fur movement _ not on the tundra, but
in the marketplace.
   Two native groups in Alaska and Canada plan to seek out small
markets to sell native-trapped and-sewn fur clothing. But animal
rights activists contend the embryonic plans are doomed, and
promise to oppose the products as much as they do furs from
non-native trappers and marketers.
   ``We have no problems with native subsistence wildlife killing
as long as its done as humanely as possible,'' said Michael
O'Sullivan, spokesman for the World Society for the Protection of
Animals in Toronto.
   ``But we cannot accept commercial fur sales. It's not who
carries out the activity, but the activity itself,'' he said.
   Alaska's Athabascan Indians and the Inuit Eskimos of Canada
retort that the animal protectionists appear to care little about
the human suffering caused by native unemployment, or about the
survival of native cultures.
   And anti-fur activists, they say, would open the door to other
forms of development that would be far more threatening to the
environment and animals.
   Their anger at the anti-fur forces has simmered for years, but
it was just three years ago that they formed Indigenous Survival
International, a militant native group that spans Alaska, Canada
and Greenland.
   The marketing strategy was the group's idea.
   If all goes according to plan, Alaska Athabascans, through their
Yukon Flats Fur Cooperative, soon will seek markets in the United
States and Europe for furs labeled ``Authentic Native Design.''
   They hope to sell through small stores, preferably owned by
natives. They envision consumers who will buy their coats, hats,
boots and other articles more for their native artistry than for
reasons of fashion.
   The plan was forged after the cooperative sold just $150,000
worth of furs in the past two years. That small return has
endangered the cooperative because banks refuse to loan it money,
said Clarence Alexander, the Athabascan chief for the village of
Fort Yukon.
   Alexander, an Indigenous Survival International member, said his
people hoped to generate the modest amounts of cash they need to
supplement a subsistence economy based mostly on hunting, trapping,
fishing and gathering.
   ``Subsistence societies like the Athabascans and the Inuit need
a little cash to buy gas for boats, to heat with oil, to buy
ammunition,'' said Robert Higgins, a spokesman for the Canadian
Inuit's umbrella organization, Inuit Tapirisat in Ottawa.
   Fur sales are their only ready source of cash, he said.
   The organization wants to revive the harvest of adult ringed
seals as a way of returning Canada's 28,000 Inuit to a subsistence
economy, Higgins said.
   Their sealing-based culture was devastated by a powerful
anti-sealing movement that caught on in 1983. The impetus was
photographs _ grisly pictures of non-native sealers clubbing Harp
seal pups to death off Newfoundland.
   Higgins said his group primarily wants to replace the Inuits'
store-bought food and clothing with seal meat and fur. But the
Inuit also will sell native-made fur clothing to raise cash, he
said.
   Anti-fur advocates accept native people's need to trap and shoot
animals for their own needs, said Pat Ragan, the program director
of wildlife for the Humane Society of the United States in
Washington, D.C.
   But ``to kill animals to market skins is another thing
altogether,'' she said. ``The only hope for these people is to get
away from marketing furs. We acknowledge that there are problems
with that, but I don't think selling furs is the way to solve
them.''
   Her group offers no alternatives to the native fur trade. ``Of
course we don't have an official position on that,'' she said.
``Our job is protecting animals.''
   Tom Morse, an Anchorage anti-fur activist, said natives wouldn't
need cash if they would return completely to the old ways. ``They
were heating their homes before the white man brought oil,'' and
snaring animals before white trappers introduced the steel leghold
trap, he said.
   ``They have the freedom to follow their own lifestyle. But when
they start combining cultures, the results have been disastrous,''
said Morse, a physics instructor at the University of Alaska in
Anchorage.
   Alexander reacted angrily to that logic.
   ``Some of us would like to return completely to the old ways,''
but the presence of non-natives and their competition for resources
makes that impossible, the Athabascan leader said.
   ``We have always been and still are a non-cash society, but we
are forced now to need some cash,'' Alexander said. Northern
natives, he said, could reject Western tools such as outboard
engines, guns and heating oil only if Morse and the non-native
populations left.
   In destroying the native fur trade, native leaders say, the
anti-fur movement is laying the groundwork for destruction of
animal habitat.
   They point to the Pribilof Islands, where the Aleuts hunted
seals for centuries. Then Congress ended the harvest in 1985,
limiting the killings to those used for food, and the federal
government withdrew subsidies for the Aleuts.
   ``Literally overnight, we had human suffering, suicides, more
than 100 documented attempted suicides, massive anxiety, and a
200-percent increase in the cost of groceries from the loss of the
subsidies,'' said Larry Merculieff, a leader of the Aleut islanders
and commissioner of the state Department of Commerce and Economic
Development.
   The state stepped in and poured millions of dollars into
development of a major port at Saint Paul Island, one of two in the
Pribilofs, for the thriving Bering Sea fishery, Merculieff noted.
   But that could have other consequences.
   ``Saint Paul soon will be opening its fishing port,'' he said.
``We will then have 2,000 transients on an island that is five
miles wide, 12 miles long, with a million seals, three million
birds and 700 Aleuts. The people being brought in are not sensitive
to village life or wildlife. The disruption won't be confined to
the environment, but to our social and cultural structure as well.''
   The state commerce chief is not optimistic about the native
marketing plan:
   ``It might work for five years or so, but in the long run, the
fur markets of the world are going to be completely destroyed by
the animal rights movement.''
   The effect on native cultures ``to me,'' Merculieff said, ``is
tantamount to genocide. But nobody seems to be listening.''

INTRODUCING YOUNGSTERS TO 'PEOPLE OF THE SNOW' RIGHT IN AN IRVINE PARK

<P>
If the kids have been clamoring for a little kilaujatut, load 'em up in the 
family komatik and head for "Igloos of Fun," the Irvine Fine Arts Center ninth 
annual Youth Art Day. But you had better leave the aiverk at home. 
</P>
<P>
If by chance you don't speak Inutitut, the language of the Inuit Eskimo, those 
exotic-sounding words mean, respectively, drum dancing, sled and walrus -- not 
exactly part of the average county schoolchild's vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, the Inuit come to Irvine. Well, sort of. From 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m., children ages 3 to 10 can sample the lighter side of life among these 
hardy "people of the snow" in a day of art workshops, entertainment and games 
on the center's grounds in Heritage Park. 
</P>
<P>
The children's festival coincides with four Eskimo-themed exhibits on display 
at the center through April 28. They are "Inuit Games: Traditional Sport and 
Play of the Eskimo," a collection of stone-cut prints and soapstone sculpture 
by Eskimo artists that depict games of skill and endurance; artifacts of the 
Bering Sea Eskimos from Bowers Museum's permanent collection, and "The 
Grandparents of My Gloves," a retrospective by Berkeley dancer Patricia Bulitt, 
which features costumes, recordings and mixed-media remembrances of Bulitt's 
10-year cultural exchange with Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
Bulitt recently shared her experiences with teachers from the Irvine Unified 
School District. District teachers passed on the lesson to their students, who 
interpreted their studies in a series of drawings, poetry and clay sculptures 
displayed at the center's gallery. (A drawing by Culverdale School student Mike 
Jazayeri sums up the children's cross-cultural experience with a decidedly 
California flair: The Alaskan god of summer, a six-armed figure, wears 
sunglasses and clutches a hot dog, an ice cream cone and a Beach Boys album.) 
</P>
<P>
Docent tours of the exhibits will be offered through the day. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's festivities center on seven, hourlong art workshops and several 
Eskimo games that will introduce children to the culture, said Jill Stute, the 
center's special events coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"The Inuit used games as a means of developing strength and manual dexterity," 
Stute said. "Theirs was a harsh way of life, and some of their games were very 
physically taxing. The kids can see those tougher games in the exhibit, and on 
the day of the festival they'll get hands-on experience with games like Eskimo 
yo-yos and bean-bag juggling." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stute said, Dori Kirk Fitzgerald, the center's curator of 
exhibitions, will lead children in an authentic Eskimo hunting dance taught to 
her by Bullitt, and storytellers will share traditional tales of the Eskimo. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's balmy weather is a far cry from the Eskimo's chilly climate, so a snow 
machine will provide a frosting of real snow on the center's lawn. The snow 
will fall at 11 a.m. Depending on the weather, it should last about an hour, 
Stute said. 
</P>
<P>
Art workshops will begin at 10 a.m. In "Magical Masks," children 6 and older 
will create masks based on Arctic animals. "Snow Prints" introduces youngsters 
to a variation on Eskimo-style block printing. In "Charms and Spells," children 
will learn how good-luck charms and magic spells helped the Eskimo succeed in 
the hunt, then create their own charms in clay. 
</P>
<P>
"Arctic Antics" is a collaborative project in which small groups will create 
clay scenes of Eskimo life, which will be fired and later displayed in the 
center's gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Go Fish" will be geared for children ages 3 to 5. In it, children will learn 
about fish as a staple in the Eskimo diet, then design and decorate their own 
fish from a grab bag of art materials. In the "Drawing and Painting 
Expedition," children will hear tales of the Eskimo hunt, then depict their 
impressions in mixed media. "It's Snowing" will let young artists create snow 
by drawing Arctic scenes, then applying a solution of epsom salts that form 
snowlike crystals on the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Two drop-in workshops -- "Arctic Mural," in which youngsters will contrast 
their life style with the Eskimo's on two large murals, and "Build Your Own 
Igloo," a construction project of fair-weather igloos of cardboard and paint -- 
will be offered throughout the day. Face-painting will also be available for a 
small fee. 
</P>
<P>
In the center's courtyard, such local entertainers as the Lori Hansen Dancers, 
the Rainbow Singers and Sky Badger, an American Indian who tells folk stories, 
will be presented. Food will be sold from 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth Art day will be Saturday at the Irvine Fine Arts Center, 14321 Yale Ave. 
in Irvine's Heritage Park. Attendance is open to the entire family. Children 
under 6 must be accompanied by an adult. Walk-in registration will begin at 9 
a.m. Registration fee is $9 per child and includes two 1-hour workshops, both 
drop-in workshops and all entertainment and games. Adults are free.

<DATELINE>ILULISSAT, Greenland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A constant parade of Titanic-sized
icebergs slowly drifts with the currents of Disko Bay in sight of
this west coast fishing port.
   Spawned by the Northern Hemisphere's most productive glacier 25
miles to the south, these mountains of ice break off with a
thunderous roar and begin their silent arctic voyage.
   The barking of sled dogs, which outnumber the 4,000 people of
the town, mixes with the chugging of cutters and shrimp boats and
the hum of the fish factories in the tiny harbor.
   Against the darkened sky, the Northern Lights unfurl in wavy
sheets of red and green across the horizon.
   Ilulissat, which means icebergs in the native language, is
inhabited by Inuits who are culturally and linguistically related
to the Eskimos of Alaska and others in Canada and Siberia.
   Nearly everyone in the town, 180 miles north of the Arctic
Circle, make their living from the sea.
   Its economy is totally dependent on shrimp and halibut catches,
which the local fishermen deliver directly to the two big state-run
fish factories, employing 350 people in the peak season.
   Ilulissat, Greenland's third-largest town, also is known by its
Danish name, Jacobshavn. Denmark, which ruled Greenland for 200
years, made it an autonomous territory under the Danish crown 10
years ago.
   About 50 fishing boats, ranging from factory trawlers to one-man
cutters, operate during the summer from Ilulissat's natural harbor.
   In the winters of 24-hour darkness, many fishermen such as
Soeren Madsen go ``longlining'' on the Icefjord, a frozen fiord at
the foot of the glacier.
   ``We drive 35 miles overland across rough terrain in dogsleds to
the fishing grounds, and the temperature can fall to minus 22
degrees Fahrenheit out on the ice,'' Madsen says.
   Long lines strung with up to 100 hooks are sunk through holes
cut in the ice and then hauled up by hand from the depths.
   ``You have to return with a catch of at least 400 pounds to make
it pay,'' Madsen says.
   A typical fishing tour on the ice lasts 48 hours, during which
time the men live in low, conical tents with a Primus stove to keep
warm.
   The dog teams of 10 to 12 huskies sleep huddled together out in
the open. They are capable of running 12 hours non-stop.
   Some of the fishermen make a little extra money on the side
driving sleds for winter tourists who come to see the natural
wonders of the Disko Bay area.
   In Ilulissat, it's an unwritten law that dog sleds have the
right of way.
   Ilulissat municipality includes four small outlying settlements
of 80 to 100 inhabitants each. Beyond those tiny villages lie
nothing but the glacial ice pack, 2{ miles thick, of Greenland's
interior.
   No roads link the town with its satellite settlements. Travel is
by boat, sled or helicopter.
   The Greenlandic dog, a special breed protected by a ban on
imports of other races, is not tame, and visitors are advised not
to pet them.
   Practically every dwelling in the town has a dog team in the
yard where fish for their fodder is hung up in racks to dry.
   The dogs must be kept chained, their fangs cut. Stray dogs are
shot on orders from the authorities.
   Many hunters are embittered over an anti-sealing campaign waged
by conservationists that ruined the once-lucrative skin trade.
   In the early 1980s, environmental groups such as Greenpeace,
spurred on by French actress and self-styled animal friend Brigitte
Bardot, launched highly publicized protests against the Canadian
practice of bludgeoning seal pups to death for their prized white
pelts.
   Gruesome pictures of the Canadian seal hunt became associated in
the public mind with the Greenlanders' traditional hunt, which does
not include pups.
   Seal pups are born on the ice floes off northern Canada and are
rarely seen in Greenlandic waters.
   Prices for Greenlandic skins plunged in Europe, and the United
States, a major market, banned the import of seal skins.
   ``Greenpeace eventually apologized to Greenland, but they should
have admitted their mistake to the consumers as well,'' said Adolf
Jensen, a hunter who comes from a tiny settlement 62 miles north of
Ilulissat.

LIVING ARCTIC: Hunters of the Canadian North by Hugh Brody (University of 
Washington Press: $14.95, illustrated). Brody's thoughtful essays on the 
history, culture and languages of the Arctic and sub-Arctic peoples of Canada 
contrast the let's-rub-noses stereotypes with the true nature of these caring, 
anti-authoritarian cultures.

The respectful relationship that the Inuit maintained with their seemingly 
hostile environment ensured the survival of the people and the animals that 
supplied their food. (Recent studies have shown that their exclusive diet of 
meat and fat supplied all the nutrients necessary for human health: Diabetes 
and other metabolic diseases were unknown among the Inuit until "Southerners" 
introduced them to flour, sugar and alcohol.) The concluding discussion of 
politics documents the growing movement among the Native Peoples to preserve 
their traditional values, despite the increasing commercial exploitation of the 
Arctic and its mineral resources. Charles Solomon

   Gulf Canada Ends
   Plan for Test Well
   In Arctic Ocean

   OTTAWA -- Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. said it canceled
plans to drill a 60 million Canadian dollar (US$51.9 million)
exploratory oil well in the western Arctic Ocean because of a
lack of industry support for the project.
   The decision means that no new wells will be drilled this
year in Canada's Beaufort Sea region, which leads into the
Arctic Ocean. Gulf Canada, an energy concern, is a unit of
Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which is
controlled by the Reichmann family. It had proposed to drill
as many as four wells in the region over the next three
years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Frank Mitton, manager of Gulf Canada's northern
operations, said the company will decide in the next few
months whether to carry out its plans to drill the remaining
wells. Mr. Mitton said Gulf's decision to cancel the well was
unrelated to an earlier ruling by a Canadian environmental
panel. The panel had recommended that the Canadian government
reject Gulf's plans because the company was unprepared to
deal with a major oil spill. "We cannot drill the well
because we don't have sufficient industry support for it,"
Mr. Mitton said.
   The well was to have been located about 18 miles east of
Gulf Canada's big Amauligak oil field. Several oil and gas
finds have been made in the Beaufort Sea but none of the
discoveries has been brought into production.
   Gulf is the second company that has canceled an Arctic
exploration program this year. Amoco Canada Petroleum Co., a
unit of Chicago-based Amoco Corp., recently canceled plans to
drill two wells in the Beaufort Sea, because of insufficient
interest from its partners. Amoco plans to carry out some
seismic work this summer.
   Ed Zederayko, an oil industry analyst, said low energy
prices and reduced federal government exploration incentives
are causing more companies to defer their offshore drilling
plans.
   But a spokesman for Chevron Canada Resources Ltd., which
was to have held about 22% interest in Gulf's proposed well,
said Chevron was committed to going ahead with the plan.
Chevron Canada, a unit of San Francisco-based Chevron Corp.,
"has an ongoing interest in the North," he said.
   The Canadian Environmental Impact Review Board had
recommended earlier this month that government regulators
reject Gulf Canada's Arctic drilling plan because of the
potentially devastating effects of an oil spill on the area's
environmentally sensitive coastline. The board, which is made
up of representatives from the federal government, the
governments of the Yukon and Northwest Territories and the
Western Arctic Inuit natives, criticized Gulf Canada and the
government for their "startling lack of preparedness" for
dealing with a major oil well blowout.
   Canada Oil and Gas Lands Administration, the government
regulators, had yet to issue its decision on whether it would
accept the environmental board's ruling.
   Gulf Canada officials estimated that a hypothetical
worst-case well blowout could release 40,000 barrels of oil a
day for 66 days, or 10 times more oil than was released when
Exxon Corp.'s Valdez tanker ran aground in Alaska last year.
They said the cleanup of such a spill could be beyond Gulf
Canada's financial capabilities.

<HEAD>Team Plans Icewalk to Dramatize Arctic's Environmental Hazards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international expedition plans to walk 483 miles
across the ice to the North Pole in an effort to dramatize the
hazards they believe are threatening the arctic.
   The team, which includes members from Canada, the United States,
the Soviet Union, Britain, Japan, Australia and West Germany, hopes
to set out on the 65-day trip around March 10-15 from Cape Columbia,
Canada's northernmost point of land on the Arctic Ocean.
   The American in the group is Darryl Roberts of the Bronx, N.Y.
   ``Everyone has to understand that this is no walk in the park,''
said Peter Baird, the Canadian liaison for the Icewalk expedition.
``This is a life-threatening project.''
   The expedition is led by Robert Swan, the British explorer who
walked to the South Pole with two other men in 1986. A successful
completion of the northern trip would make him the first on record
to walk to both poles.
   Baird is an administrator and will not be among the eight-member
team that walks to the North Pole. His Ottawa company, the Conexus
Research Group, served as the managers for the Canadian-Soviet ski
expedition that crossed the arctic ice cap last year to widespread
acclaim.
   Baird had no easy explanation for why adventurers seem to keep
trying to come up with new projects and goals in the arctic.
   ``Who knows what motivates them?'' he said. ``It's an athletic
thing, clearly, in some ways. It's the right to say you're first. .
.. And some sort of declaration that the human spirit is still alive
and kicking.''
   At around the time the Icewalk begins, another expedition will
have already started, if all goes on schedule, on a dog-sled trek
across the frozen Bering Strait separating Alaska and Soviet
Siberia. The purpose of the trek by a U.S.-Soviet team of 10 men and
two women is to call attention to the common cultural heritage of
the indigenous people living on both sides of the strait. The
two-month expedition is scheduled to depart from Anadyr, Siberia, on
March 1.
   The $4 million Icewalk to the North Pole has lined up Amway, the
Michigan-based marketing company, as its major corporate sponsor.
   The Icewalk is different from other similar ventures in that it
will use only human power. Supplies will be brought along in sledges
that require tremendous energy to haul their 250-300 pound cargoes.
The group will use skis, but there will be no dogsleds or
skimobiles. The team will be flown back after reaching its goal.
   It also hopes to attract attention by bringing an international
group of about 30 teen-age students to a base camp at Eureka on
Ellesmere Island to help with radio monitoring and to promote the
anti-pollution message.
   Team members will gather snow and atmospheric samples to record
pollution levels in the region. They will be testing for mercury _
said to be the first such tests in the region _ as well as tracking
sulphates, nitrates, chlorides and graphite particles. They also
will collect pollen samples to help find the origin of pollutants.
   Canadian research over the past four years has turned up dozens
of toxic substances in the region's fragile ecosystem, many of them
entering the food chain. Attention also has focused on the thinning
of the world's ozone layer, most notably at the world's poles, and
on acid rain.
   Baird said the team will spend about a month training at a base
camp before venturing out on the ice from Cape Columbia on the
65-day trip.
   ``There's only a certain window when you can do this,'' he added.
   Waiting warmer weather means too much open sea and drifting ice;
taking off too soon means too much harsh weather and temperatures
that are too cold.
   ``They can count on rough, rough ice _ sea ice _ for the first
100 kilometers (62 miles),'' Baird said. ``It's a maze; it's like a
giant jigsaw puzzle.''
   The temperatures could be as low as 70 degrees below zero
(Fahrenheit) at the outset, while winds could be as strong as about
55 miles an hour. The plans call for daily consumption of more than
6,000 calories by each member of the team to keep up energy.
   The Canadian on the team is Angus Clarence ``Kaanerk'' Cockney,
who is an Inuit, as Eskimos are called in Canada. He was born and
reared in Canada's Northwest Territories.

   Gulf Canada Plan
   For Ocean Drilling

   OTTAWA -- A Canadian environmental panel recommended that
the federal government reject plans by Gulf Canada Resources
Ltd. to drill in the western Arctic Ocean, citing the
potentially devastating effects of a spill.
   The recommendation, if accepted by the federal government,
would result in a suspension of operations in Canada's
Beaufort Sea region, which leads into the Arctic Ocean. Gulf
Canada, a unit of Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York Developments
Ltd., which is controlled by the Reichmann family, is the
only company that planned to drill there this year.

   The Environmental Impact Review Board said Gulf Canada, an
energy concern, and federal regulators had demonstrated
"complacency" toward environmental protection and wildlife
preservation. The regulators, the Canada Oil and Gas Lands
Administration, will rule on Gulf Canada's drilling plans.
   Gulf Canada had proposed to drill four wells in the
Beaufort Sea in the next three years.
   The environmental board, made up of representatives from
the federal government, the governments of the Yukon and
Northwest Territories, and Western Arctic Inuit natives, said
Gulf Canada hadn't been able to estimate the effects of an
oil spill on the area's coastline or to give details of how
the company would carry out cleanup operations in the event
of a spill. It said Gulf Canada didn't provide adequate
evidence at a public hearing last month to enable the board
to estimate the cost of cleaning up a hypothetical worst-case
oil spill.
   Gulf Canada officials estimated that a worst-case well
blowout could release 40,000 barrels of oil a day for 66
days, or 10 times more oil than that released when Exxon
Corp.'s Valdez tanker ran aground in Alaska last year. The
board said such a spill could have "devastating impacts on
sensitive shorelines and on wildlife that could last for
decades."
   Frank Mitton, manager of Gulf Canada's northern
operations, said the board's comments were even "harsher than
anticipated." Gulf Canada has "all the plans and precautions
to make sure we don't have an environmental disaster," he
said.
   The review board said it blamed the lack of preparedness
for dealing with oil spills on "a complacency" on the part of
Gulf Canada and the government, which is "driven by an
ultimate belief that a blowout is so unlikely to occur that
preparing to meet it is largely an academic exercise."
   It added: "This is the kind of complacency that has been
blamed for the confused response to the Exxon Valdez oil
spill."
   Maurice Taschereau, administrator of the Canada Oil and
Gas Lands Administration, said he was "shaken and puzzled" by
the board's criticism. He said the agency has "lots of
contingency plans" in place to deal with environmental
disasters. Mr. Taschereau declined to indicate how his agency
will respond to the board's recommendations. It has 30 days
to reach a decision.
   Stephen Hazell, executive director of the Canadian Arctic
Resources Committee, an environmental group, said the federal
regulator can't reject the board's advice without calling
into question the government's own environmental review
process.
   No wells are being drilled in the Beaufort Sea now. Amoco
Canada Petroleum Co., a unit of Chicago-based Amoco Corp.,
recently canceled its plans to drill two wells in the
Beaufort Sea, because of insufficient interest from its
partners to proceed with the project. An Amoco spokesman said
the company now intends to carry out some seismic work this
summer.

IN THE FAR NORTH, CANADA'S NATIVE PEOPLES HAVE GROWN DISILLUSIONED WITH THE 
'BLACKROBES.' BUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS MAKING NEW EFFORTS WITH CLERGY FROM

FT. SIMPSON, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 years ago, the "Francis Xavier of the frigid zone," Father Henri 
Grollier, paddled down the Mackenzie River and beached here, kitted out with a 
long black cassock, a bronze crucifix and the Oblate order's motto of grueling 
devotion, "Usque ad extremum terrae" -- "Even unto the ends of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
He evidently made a compelling sight: Within days, he had blessed five 
marriages, baptized 34 children and heard 11 adults ask to be received into the 
Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
"My trip to Ft. Simpson was a triumphal march," he reported to his faraway 
bishop. 
</P>
<P>
All of that belonged to the glory days of Roman Catholicism in the Canadian 
North, a time when the "Blackrobes," along with the rough-hewn fur traders of 
the Hudson's Bay Co. and a few scattered Mounties, made up what there was of a 
Canadian "government" presence in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
Single-minded young priests traveled by dog sled in winter and canoe in the 
summer, with bundled vestments and skins filled with holy water and wine. They 
slept on spruce boughs in hide tents, hunted, trapped and fished for their food 
and everywhere sought the nomadic native peoples they hoped to convert, who in 
turn sought the migrating caribou. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the Catholic Church in the hard, cold North presents a far less 
invigorating picture. The native peoples of northern Canada -- the Dene Nation, 
the Cree and the Inuit, or Eskimos -- have grown deeply disillusioned about 
white outsiders trying to uplift and "improve" them. Many have turned to their 
traditional legends and beliefs, and in doing so, have rejected the church. 
</P>
<P>
And now, too, there is the sheer scarcity of priests. The earliest Blackrobes 
streamed to the Canadian northwest from France, Belgium and Quebec, bringing 
with them a heartening supposition that as the church took root and flourished 
in the Arctic, a native clergy would rise to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
But not only have Dene and Inuit men proved uninterested in the priesthood; 
these days, even the white Europeans who used to serve in the North are 
unwilling to accept the rigors of celibacy, loneliness, Arctic weather and an 
evermore unreceptive flock. 
</P>
<P>
"I have quite a problem on my hands with recruiting," admits Bishop Denis 
Croteau, sitting in his simply furnished office in Yellowknife, capital of the 
Northwest Territories. Indeed, when Bishop Croteau came here from Quebec as a 
young priest in 1960, there were 62 priests to shrive men's souls in the vast 
775,000-square-mile Mackenzie-Ft. Smith diocese. Now there are only 19. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these are in their 60s and even older. Until recently, a glum reality 
hung over them: When they died, they knew the church in the North was likely to 
die with them. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is a light at the end of the tunnel," the bishop adds. That light is 
being shed by Poland, a country where, in sharp contrast to Canada and the 
United States, Catholic seminaries are full, the church enjoys widespread 
credibility and young men come to holy orders with a zeal to share what they 
have with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a delegation of anxious Oblates from northwestern Canada visited 
Poland, to beg their brethren to send a few good men north of the 60th 
parallel. The appeal worked. By 1995, Poland is expected to have dispatched a 
dozen young priests to take up the work of the aging Blackrobes in the North. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland seems willing to supply us," says Bishop Croteau, whose manpower 
worries were such that he dropped courageous, if futile, hints in the wake of a 
papal visit here that perhaps priests ought to be free to marry. 
</P>
<P>
But in attracting young Polish Oblates to northern Canada, the church is also 
attracting controversy. For northern Canada is marginalized and poor -- a 
little bit of the Third World in North America, people say -- and the 
Blackrobes of yesteryear who grew to understand the region blazed a trail here 
toward the social gospel. 
</P>
<P>
Much in the mold of the liberation theologists of Latin America, priests 
ministering in the Arctic and sub-Arctic have witnessed native misery and 
concluded that if the church were to have meaning in northern lives, it would 
have to get involved in northern, secular struggles. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it was missionary priests who set up the first cooperatives in northern 
Canada and who organized the first native-language radio broadcasts in the 
Arctic. It was priests who devised new alphabets for the indigenous northern 
languages, and priests who were the first to train scholarly eyes on 
traditional spiritual beliefs and practices. 
</P>
<P>
One aging northern Oblate, Father Camille Piche, achieved local fame for saying 
Mass in Slavey, an Indian language, even though some of his congregants were 
unilingual whites. Lately, he has been fighting a proposed pulp mill that 
threatens to pollute traditional fishing waters of the Mackenzie River basin. 
</P>
<P>
Another noted activist priest, the French-born Father Rene Fumoleau, wrote a 
path-breaking study of northern Indian treaties, and thereby sparked 20 years 
of tough land-tenure negotiations with the federal government. Militant Dene in 
the region regard Father Rene, who lives in a two-room cabin in Yellowknife 
with no running water, as one of but a handful of whites they can trust. 
</P>
<P>
"We western missionaries felt we had more to teach than to learn," Father Rene 
says of his early years in Canada, when he was given five dogs, a sled and 
instructions to ride a 2,000-mile priestly circuit every winter. "It was the 
colonial system. The situation changed, so I changed, too -- no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Can the young priests of Poland build on such a legacy? The Polish clergy, 
after all, has encountered problems of a greatly different nature: not neglect 
by Indian-affairs bureaucrats or mindless resource exploitation by huge outside 
concerns, but half a century of totalitarian opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Their thinking, as an unsurprising consequence, tends to the traditional and 
the conservative -- not to say the reactionary. Liberation theology goes down 
poorly with the Poles; leftist biblical exegesis smacks all too much of the 
Marxist dogma that they and their village pastors struggled so long to 
overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when the Canadian delegation set out for Warsaw, skeptics worried. Would 
transplanted Polish priests ever fit in? 
</P>
<P>
One answer may eventually be found in the fortunes of 29-year-old Father 
Andrezej Stendzina, now of Ft. Simpson. Father Andrezej is the first of the new 
Polish priests to arrive in the Mackenzie-Ft. Smith diocese, and today is by 
far the youngest priest serving the faithful for thousands of square miles. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to Ft. Simpson, I told the people, I have come to learn, not to 
teach," he says in accented English. As yet, no one in Ft. Simpson, aside from 
a few local Canadians of Polish ancestry, has mastered the pronunciation of his 
Polish name. To everyone, he is simply Father Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of his priest-compatriots, Father Andrew is an unstinting 
traditionalist. He has little truck with a married priesthood and believes that 
politics and religion mix at the peril of the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Liberation theology? He shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hear that in some countries (church) people want to bring communism, I 
can't believe it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Father Andrew is the very picture of open-mindedness when it 
comes to the folkways of Ft. Simpson, a traditional Dene meeting place that 
grew apace with the Hudson's Bay trading post here. Already, he shuffles 
rhythmically in traditional Dene drum dances, down by the sacred confluence of 
the Liard and Mackenzie rivers. He has been teaching the young to play soccer. 
He hopes that in a few more months, he'll be fluent enough to say Mass in 
Slavey. 
</P>
<P>
Father Andrew may have his quarrel with a politically engaged priesthood, but 
the faith he has brought to northern Canada was shaped in no small part by a 
worldly wise, and militant, Polish church. 
</P>
<P>
"The government was telling us stupid things, but people could learn the real 
facts at church," he says, negotiating his pickup truck along the long, empty 
gravel roads that link the villages of his vast parish, stopping here and there 
to smoke a cigarette or read his daily office from an Oblate breviary. "The 
church was the moral support for everybody who wanted to change things." 
</P>
<P>
Father Andrew was still a seminarian, preparing for the work of the church in 
Africa, when the Canadian recruiters reached his hometown of Lubliniec, in 
southern Poland, looking for missionaries for the far north of another 
continent. He thought things through and concluded that the need in Canada was 
the more pressing. 
</P>
<P>
"In Africa, they can get young priests any time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he arrived in Toronto, all his earthly possessions in two suitcases. 
He learned English, was ordained in Ft. Simpson, and said his first Mass in 
Edmonton, Alberta, at a nursing home for elderly missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
"You could almost feel their excitement when they saw that finally someone 
young had come to continue their work," he says. "They had sacrificed their 
health, their life, their energy, and they knew that when they had to leave, 
well. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
There are eight villages in Father Andrew's parish, some, but not all, 
connected by gravel roads. The biggest is Ft. Simpson, population 1,000 or so. 
It harbors a rectory roomy enough for the half a dozen priests who used to live 
here; there is also a nuns' residence and a wooden church, painted green and 
white. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, the nuns are gone, and the priestly population is down to just 
two: Father Andrew and a 49-year-old colleague, Father George LaGrange, who 
until the Pole's arrival was the youngest priest in the diocese. Gone, too, are 
the dog sleds of years gone by. Father George, a pilot, flies a light plane to 
the roadless villages, while Father Andrew serves the rest in his pickup. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Father Andrew's parishioners haven't seen a resident priest in years. 
When he arrives on 40-below winter evenings, he must chip away the ice from the 
doorways, find fuel, scare up a place to sleep, hear confessions and say Mass. 
Some villages have eager beavers who want to help with the liturgy. But others 
have problems that come as quite a shock to him, after Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Father Andrew had never even heard of child molestation before he left his 
homeland; here, he finds it a spreading concern. 
</P>
<P>
He cannot help but notice the drunkards who dodge him in the streets of Ft. 
Simpson. He has received tearful alcoholics who say they want to dry out -- and 
who leave the rectory and head straight for a bar. He has learned, on pastoral 
visits, to step nonchalantly over heaps of garbage on people's living-room 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible sometimes," he says. "It's really hard." 
</P>
<P>
Still, in every household he visits, the people sooner or later ask him to pray 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who pin a large measure of responsibility for the North's 
rampant social problems on the Catholic Church itself. Angry native Canadians, 
baptized as children, say that in its efforts to "tame" them, the church 
undermined their culture and left them without a sense of who they are. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, these natives blame Canada's so-called residential schools, set 
up by the federal government to assimilate native children, and run by the 
Catholic Church. All across Canada, from 1920 to 1970, native children were 
taken out of their remote hunting villages and compulsorily packed off to the 
residential schools, where nuns cut off their braids, dressed them in uniforms, 
demanded that they speak French and English and made them attend Mass every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Critics now say that at the very least, the institutionalized children were 
robbed of their ability to live normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of family problems now (among native Canadians), because 
people don't know how to parent," says Alice Hill, a social worker in 
Yellowknife who grew up in a residential school. She herself is divorced, and 
adds that she cannot talk to her own Slavey-speaking mother any more, because 
the nuns forced her to speak English and forget Slavey. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, some native adults now charge that they were beaten, malnourished 
and sexually abused in the schools. At one notorious residential school in 
Saskatchewan, the Thunderchild Boarding School, former students allege that one 
boy died after a severe beating, which police and the church deny. 
</P>
<P>
What no one contests is an investigation that revealed 45 deaths out of 605 
children between 1903 and 1948, when four desperate students torched the 
buildings, forcing the school's closure. The deaths were from a variety of 
causes but the main ones were tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough and 
similar diseases. Critics of the residential schools say the children would not 
have contracted these diseases if they had been left in their villages. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, other native Catholics are still stirred by the religious 
discipline and traditions that a priest like Father Andrew represents. One of 
these is Joe Mercredi, the mixed-blood editor of Ft. Simpson's local newspaper, 
the Mackenzie Times. 
</P>
<P>
Mercredi writes provocative native-rights editorials under the pen name 
"Ramjoe;" last summer, he even took up arms against the Canadian army over a 
land dispute in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all that, he also keeps a picture of Pope John Paul II on his office 
wall, and ridicules fellow natives who trace their woes back to the arrival of 
the Catholic missionaries. He insists that residential schools like 
Thunderchild were the exception, not the norm. He worries that the social 
gospel will divide his people, and he admires tough, traditional priests. He 
was thrilled when he heard that the church was sending someone from Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, the children are going to have a shield, and that is Father 
Andrew," he says. "He will be like the priests when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, Mercredi turned up at the mission house door, asking Father 
Andrew to say Mass, not in English, not in Slavey, but in Latin. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the old-timers prefer the Mass in Latin," he explains. "Latin had a 
flair to it. By comparison, English seems dead." 
</P>
<P>
Later that afternoon, a surprised Father Andrew complied. 
</P>
<P>
How to sort out the traditional and the modern, the European and the 
indigenous, the political and the personal? That will be Father Andrew's 
biggest mission in the North. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a lot to learn," he says. "I'll probably be learning for the rest 
of my life." 
</P>

About 27,000 voters in Canada's Northwest Territories have narrowly approved
the setting up from 1999 of the region of Nunavut, a vast area including
most of the eastern Arctic, Robert Gribbens reports from Montreal. It is
seen as the first step toward creating a homeland for the Inuit.
Most of the inhabited Arctic islands are included in Nunavut, but the
Beaufort Sea remains in the western NWT.
Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, is returning to the constitutional
negotiating table with a four-day visit to western Canada and direct talks
with the four western premiers.
He wants to put a federal constitutional offer before Quebec voters this
autumn, rather than hold a referendum on Quebec's sovereignty.
He is now trying to ensure the offer will be at least as generous to Quebec
as Ottawa's Meech Lake proposals, which failed to get unanimous provincial
consent in 1990.

Greenland, a former Danish colony 10 years into home rule, is a forbidding
land of immense ice packs, serious social problems and chronic unemployment.
It has the world's highest suicide rate. But now this bad luck island may
have received a pre-Christmas present no one expected: GOLD.    ___</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Just when things were looking bleakest in
this ice-bound island of 53,000 people and 1,800 oxen, nature came
to the rescue.
   Until a few months ago, this is how things looked:
   The U.S. Air Force was closing Greenland's only international
airport and the four radar stations it supplied.
   A Canadian-owned lead and zinc mine was closing, and off-shore
oil exploration so far has proved fruitless.
   There was chronic unemployment _ except when the fish are
running. Alcoholism and venereal disease were rampant and every
year 50 Greenlanders kill themselves. It's the world's highest
suicide rate, 129 per 100,000, more than double No. 2 Hungary's 45
per 100,000.
   All of those things still stand, but in November Danish and
Canadian geologists announced they had found gold, a
1.6-square-mile patch on the country's east coast, comparable in
size to South African gold reserves.
   A Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, reported that mining could
begin in 5 years and could yield 12 tons of gold a year, which at
current prices comes to something like $150 million.
   That should come as good news to Denmark, which last year
provided semi-autonomous Greenland with $347 million, or 86 percent
of the island's budget.
   It would also pay the $30 million a year it takes to keep open
the Sondre Stromfjord airfield where a sign proclaims ``United
States Air Force Space Command.''
   There's nothing Space Age about the primeval-looking musk oxen
roaming the nearby arctic hinterland. But, provided by the
Americans, they are the only thing that flourishes around here.
   The oxen, today 1,800 strong, are the offspring of a few hundred
shaggy beasts flown here in U.S. transport planes four years ago
and set loose as a gesture of good will.
   The airfield, nestled between a jade-green fiord and the foot of
a glacier, is Greenland's only international airport, a hub of
civilian flights.
   This year the former Danish colony celebrates 10 years of
semi-independence under a home-rule system, with its own parliament
and two legislators sitting in the Danish parliament in Copenhagen.
   Some income is generated by 300 U.S. servicemen and about 2,000
Danish civilians, who pay income tax, working at the controversial
Thule radar base in the far north.
   The U.S. military has volunteered other aid besides running the
airport, which services Nuuk, Greenland's capital, 198 miles to the
south. Recently the Army Corps of Engineers offered to help with
public works projects in remote settlements.
   The gold find, which the Greenlanders will split 50-50 with
Denmark, will augment the few exploitable resources of the world's
largest island, notably fish and shrimp. There are other problems
just as formidable, such as the suicides.
   ``Alcohol is always involved, along with problems with the
girlfriend,'' says Rene Christensen, the chief physician for the
Nuuk district.
   Women had a total of 870 abortions last year, against 1,100
births.
   ``Venereal disease is 100 times higher than in Denmark,''
Christensen says.
   The economy is drained by the expensive social welfare programs
inherited from Denmark. The city of Nuuk, Greenland's largest with
13,000 people, pays $14 million a year for benefits such as
subsidized housing, kindergartens and day care centers and
unemployment. Free health service is provided by the Danes.
   The job situation, never good, was worsened by the international
campaign against seal and whale hunting, one of the main sources of
income for the Inuit people, whose life is centered on hunting and
fishing.
   ``It became shameful to be seen in a sealskin coat,'' complains
Adolf Jensen, a hunter from a small village 250 miles north of the
Arctic Circle.
   ``Today Greenlanders can't live by hunting alone, though hunter
families can supplement their incomes by using skins for clothing
and eating the meat.''
   The end of professional seal hunting has led to an uncontrolled
growth in seal herds, which has been blamed by some experts for the
sudden depletion of cod stocks several years ago.
   Greenland is a glacial land of primitive and permanent white
beauty, where dogsleds, coastal steamers and helicopters are the
main means of travel outside the towns.
   Ninety percent of Greenlanders live on the west coast of the
island, which is three-fourths the size of Australia.

<LEADPARA>  I'LL never forget my first "Kabloona.";    It was more than 20 years ago, the
day I arrived on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, that a close friend
pressed a been-around copy of that curiously titled book into my dubious hands
and simply said, "Read this." He knew, as I was soon to find out, how
superfluous it would have been to say more about this delightful story, so
unique in its sensibility and so refreshing in its point of view.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A KABLOONA FINDS PEACE AMONG THE ESKIMOS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Books  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     First published in 1941, "Kabloona" describes the 15-month, 20,000-mile
journey that its author, Frenchman Gontran de Poncins, made to the Eskimo
lands near the North Pole. A vicomte and descendant of French essayist Michel
Eyquem de Montaigne, Poncins had become disenchanted with "the selfishness of
our world, the ungenerosity of man to man," and had taken to wandering in
places like China, India and the South Seas to see if he could discover any
alternative, according to notes that collaborator Lewis Galantiere wrote for
the Book-of-the-Month Club edition.;    Search for contentment;  "Surely of
all things in the world the rarest is a civilized man at peace with himself,"
de Poncins writes with typical candor in the preface to "Kabloona," and his
trip to the far north was an attempt to see if that barren area could in some
way provide the contentment he sought.;    Certainly de Poncins' odyssey
didn't begin as he'd envisioned; he found the first Eskimos he met to be
"actually sordid, physically repugnant, and possessed by a nature in which I
could see none of the generous hospitality of primitive peoples elsewhere." So
while the book is nominally about an arduous physical journey, it's really
about an even more strenuous psychological and spiritual one, about how this
cultivated Frenchman came to see that it was not the Eskimo but he himself who
was the uncultured savage.;    Nowhere is de Poncins' change of heart and mind
more evident than in the drolly self-deprecating title he chose for the book.
For "Kabloona" is the Eskimo term for white man, and it is not what you'd call
a complimentary one. To the Eskimo mind, to be a Kabloona is to be the
sorriest fool the Earth has ever seen, a figure of fun, not to say contempt.; 
  If the Kabloona was at the bottom of the human scale, the Eskimo, who called
himself Inuit, "a man, preeminently," was at the top, and de Poncins
increasingly comes to share that people's perception of itself. Astonished at
their expertise at hunting, tracking, trekking, igloo building and overall
survival, he is even more taken with their gentle disposition in this, the
harshest of lands:;    "These Eskimos afford me decisive proof that happiness
is a disposition of the spirit. Here was a people living in the most rigorous
climate in the world, in the most depressing surroundings imaginable, haunted
by famine in a gray and somber landscape sullen with the absence of life. . .
. They ought to have been melancholy men, men despondent and suicidal;
instead, they were a cheerful people, always laughing, never weary of
laughter. A man is happy, in sum, when he is leading the life that suits
him.";    Though de Poncins has his share of memorable adventures, including
nearly dying in a blizzard, his most exciting accomplishment is his
penetration of the Eskimo mind, the way he is able to make a completely alien
system of thought comprehensible both to himself and to us.;    Most basically
of all, de Poncins develops an understanding of the Eskimos' communal way of
life, which turns out to be the reason they immediately helped themselves to
all his provisions, an act that he had initially assumed, in typical Kabloona
fashion, was motivated by pure greed.;    "The important thing was
hospitality, ownership was nothing," he realized. "Human life in the Arctic
would vanish without this solidarity among men. It is the community that
remains alive here, not the men.";    Brotherhood a commonplace;  Finally,
then, it is the kind of person de Poncins shows himself to be that makes
"Kabloona" a unique adventure. Almost majestic in his ability to see himself
as truly the fool, de Poncins wrote a wise book that is both disarming and
enchanting in its humorous insights and poetic honesty. His search for
tranquillity, he knew, had not been in vain: "In this Arctic have I found my
peace, the peace I was never able to find outside. . . . Outside it wanted war
and flood to give man this sense of brotherhood: Here it was a commonplace of
life.";    To read this memoir (available in paperback from Carroll &amp; Graf) is
to at once envy the Eskimo their encounter with this singular Kabloona and to
be grateful that at the very least he left this record, fresh as the instant
he wrote it, for us to savor and pass on.  </TEXT>

   THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY REVOKED a 1975 "Zionism-is-racism"
resolution.
   The U.N. vote to rescind condemnation of Zionism, the
Jewish national movement that led to the birth of Israel in
1948, was 111-25, with 13 abstentions. The vote marked only
the second time in U.N. history that the assembly overturned
one of its own resolutions. The repeal resolution was
spearheaded by the U.S. and co-sponsored by 85 countries.
Among them were a number that voted for the original
anti-Zionism draft, including the Soviet Union.

<P>
There will be few Father's Day weekends as memorable for Gary and Tony 
Aliengena as the one they spent on this small North Atlantic island nation. 
</P>
<P>
The father-son team from San Juan Capistrano, piloting around the world in an 
attempt to establish Tony as the youngest aviator ever to circumnavigate the 
globe, spent Saturday on the ground, fishing, after 12 days in the air crossing 
the United States, Canada and Greenland on the way to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
After a nine-hour flight Friday across the North Atlantic, the 11-year-old 
aviator was determined to try his luck fishing, and he announced his intentions 
to do so at breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
So Tony, his father and Tony's Soviet pen pal, 10-year-old Roman Tcheremnykh, 
unpacked their fishing rods and set out on Saturday afternoon to test the water 
on a nearby lake. They returned empty-handed. "We just froze," said Gary 
Aliengena, a certified pilot who has accompanied Tony in a one-engine Cessna 
Centurion. "We didn't even get a bite." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their lack of luck at the lake, the stopover in Iceland was anything 
but dull. 
</P>
<P>
It was National Day in Iceland, a day of feast and celebration commemorating 
the nation's independence from Denmark on June 18, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Icelanders, decked out in colorful Nordic dress, jammed 
the parks and streets of this small capital, kicking up their heels to polka 
music, cheering on outdoor wrestling matches and providing a spectacle for 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The Icelandic capital seems a long way from Boston, where Tony began the second 
week of his around-the-world flight Tuesday. More precisely, it was 3,000 
miles, about the same distance he traveled in crossing the United States in the 
first week after leaving John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian crossing was the best so far of the trip, as the entourage flew 
over vast lakes and forests, rich in caribou, bear and moose. 
</P>
<P>
Departing Boston on Tuesday, Tony encountered a large storm system with light 
ice at higher altitudes. The storm system persisted through Maine to the 
Canadian border, where the clouds broke up and the weather was clear all the 
way to Moncton, where Tony and his entourage from one chase plane spent the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
With time dwindling rapidly for the Atlantic crossing, the entourage did not 
get a chance to visit two of Moncton's natural attractions: the Magnetic Hill, 
where cars appear to roll uphill, and the Tidal Bore, where a tidal surge 
occurs twice daily on the Peditcodiac River.

Tony's father and Gunter Hagen, a National Aeronautic Assn. observer aboard 
Tony's plane, spent hours poring over aeronautical charts to prepare for the 
crossing. They also checked out survival gear required by Canadian law for 
transoceanic flights, including life rafts and preservers, wet suits and 
flares. In addition, pilots of each plane brought enough candy to sustain each 
passenger for five days. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Gary Aliengena underwent questioning and an inspection of 
his Cessna by a Canadian aviation representative to obtain clearance to cross 
the Atlantic. The clearance is required in Canada only of single-engine planes. 
</P>
<P>
In a coffee shop at Moncton Airport, Transport Canada inspector Bob Lavers 
asked the 39-year-old Aliengena such questions as how many people he could hold 
on his lifeboat and the types of emergency radios he had on board. Afterward, 
Lavers nodded his approval at Aliengena's preparation.

"Just be sure to keep a close eye on weather," Lavers said. "It's a very 
hostile environment up north, and there's a lot of water. If you go down in the 
water (without wet suits and lifeboats), your chances of survival are nil." 
</P>
<P>
Tony's group eventually arrived in Iqaluit, a village with a population of 
3,000, on the shores of an inlet that plunges between the low rock hills of 
southern Baffin Island. 
</P>
<P>
In Iqaluit, formerly known as Frobisher Bay, the weary travelers were 
enthralled to find a world of Inuits, polar bears and 24-hour sun. 
</P>
<P>
During April, Indian natives are drawn from the surrounding High Arctic islands 
for Iqaluit's Toonik Tyme carnival. The carnival, which celebrates the arrival 
of spring, features skinning, igloo building, ice sculpturing and a toboggan 
race. The highlight is the choosing of a Mr. Toonik and a queen. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting at airport at Iqaluit was a delegation of Canadian dignitaries, who 
presented Tony with a polar bear flag and a certificate naming him and his crew 
members to the polar bear chapter of the Charter of Arctic Adventurers. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Tony got a chance to meet some Inuit youngsters about his own age. 
After introducing himself and answering questions from about 50 students of 
Nakasuk Elementary School, Tony then took turns asking questions, inquiring how 
many of the children had dog sleds and how sealskin tents and igloos are made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close Call 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Tony and Roman participated in a school track meet. But the most fun 
for Tony almost resulted in a serious mishap. Tony and some other youngsters on 
the trip had all been invited to drive around on a Hoverjet, which uses a 
cushion of air to glide on a frozen bay. 
</P>
<P>
Tony drove the craft, as did his sister, but when Roman and another boy climbed 
on, they crashed into a ditch. The steering wheel of the Hoverjet was broken in 
the accident, but none of the youngsters were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Greenland, where he stopped for refueling, Tony could not escape the 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the terminal at Sondrestrom, a U.S. Air Force base wedged at the head of 
a fiord, the clerks and workers bursted with excitement at Tony's two-hour 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear about the boy on radio," said Asprid Jensen, 24, a postal clerk. "Many 
of the clerks here asked yesterday, 'Where's that boy? Where's that boy?' " 
</P>
<P>
Tony seemed to barely notice the attention, however. Fatigued from his 
four-hour flight from Iqaluit to Sondrestrom, he checked into a hotel room at 
the airport and napped before setting out on his next 860 miles to Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
In Reykjavik on Saturday night, Tony and his father finally acquiesced to a 
little sightseeing. They dined at the Reykjavik Cafe and afterward toured the 
Hofdi House, a government building where former President Reagan and Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev met three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
There was no time to take in any of Iceland's spectacular geologic attractions, 
which include volcanoes, glaciers and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Oslo, Tony is scheduled to rest another day before setting 
out Tuesday on a relatively short 250-mile flight to Stockholm. Later in the 
week, he will visit Helsinki, Finland, before entering the Soviet Union on 
Friday at Leningrad.

<HEAD>Finale of Canada's Indian Standoff Does Not Mean End to Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 78-day standoff between Mohawks and
authorities in Quebec left ill feelings that may not quickly fade,
but one positive offshoot was that it focused attention on the
plight of Canada's native tribes, experts said Thursday.
   After the surrender of the last Mohawk holdouts on Wednesday,
federal and provincial governments were congratulating themselves
for avoiding major violence, and creating a new program designed to
be more sensitive to Indians.
   Meanwhile, Indians and other observers warn it won't take much
for similar situations to erupt again.
   ``The Indians are starting to say that we've come down to the
wire and we are going to hold the white man to his word,'' said
Bruce Clark, a London, Ontario, lawyer who has studied historical
documents relating to Indian relations with the government.
   ``The white man talks about the rule of law as his great gift,
let's see if we can hold him to it,'' he said.
   Georges Erasmus, grand chief of the Assembly of First Nations,
the national grouping of Canadian Indian bands, said ``there is a
tremendous onus now on the Canadian government and the Quebec
government.''
   About 50 Mohawks, including women and children, surrendered
Wednesday after being camped for nearly a month inside a drug and
alcohol treatment center in Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal. They
were taken to a nearby military base.
   The withdrawal ended a conflict that began July 11 over plans by
Oka officials to expand a golf course onto land claimed by Indians.
Dozens of people were injured and one Quebec police office was
killed in clashes.
   The golf course issue was settled early on when the federal
government bought the disputed land and said it would turn it over
to the Mohawks. But blockades set up at Oka and Kanawake, south of
Montreal, were joined by sympathy blockades by Indian bands across
the country.
   Most observers feel it was the public pressure and the
continuing negative image of Canadian officials that finally pushed
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Tuesday to announce his new
program for dealing with natives.
   He said the program would cover four points: ``land claims; the
economic and social conditions on reserves; the relationship
between aboriginal peoples and governments, and concerns of
Canada's aboriginal peoples in contemporary Canadian life.''
   ``Canada's aboriginal peoples deserve a special place in this
country as our first citizens, based on the aboriginal and treaty
rights recognized in the constitution,'' the prime minister said.
   But he added: ``I will be very clear on this point: native
self-government does not now and cannot ever mean sovereign
independence. Mohawk lands are a part of Canadian territory, and
Canadian law must and does apply.''
   That issue of law and jurisdiction are major issues between the
government and many of the country's native bands.
   ``The situation is, we do not have ordinary Canadians here,''
Erasmus said, referring to the Oka crisis. ``We have Mohawk people
that have been here for tens of thousands of years. They have not
ever voluntarily entered into a treaty that has extinguished their
rights.
   ``What is necessary is an understanding of how aboriginal
rights, treaty rights, mesh with the civilian code in Quebec and
with Canadian law.''
   There are about 450,000 ``status,'' or registered, Indians in
Canada and 33,000 Inuit, often called Eskimos. These native people
make up 593 bands on 2,234 reserves covering 6.4 million acres.
   For many reserve Indians, life is a continuous struggle against
poverty, alcoholism, poor health services. They also face lack of
plumbing, sewage disposal and drinking water. Death by injury or
poisoning is quadruple that for the rest of Canada; life expectancy
is nine years less than for a white Canadian.
   Natives in general have a deep well of sympathy among white
Canadians, but the Indian struggles take place mostly in obscure
camps and reserves far from the general population.
   Taking up arms ``can't help but come up again,'' said attorney
Clark.
   ``There are two solutions. One is the rule of law. The other is
self-help. We are at the point now where Indians are tired of
talking. Will violence happen again? It's almost a certainty that
it will.''
   Clark quotes from a royal proclamation of 1763 that guarantees
the right of Indians to self-government. He says that was
reaffirmed in the 1982 constitution.
   ``Canadian history from that point took a very different road
from that of the United States. From that point, the Indians in
Canada laid down their arms. There was no Indian warfare.
   ``Either Canada will honor its own constitutional law, or it
will have to change its constitutional law.''
   The natives say they have taken the government at its word, that
it will enter into serious negotiations with the Indians now that
the Mohawks at Oka have laid down their arms.
   ``The end of the standoff is just the first step,'' said Ethel
Blondin, an Indian member of the House of Commons. ``The government
must cough up what it appeared to promise.
   ``The only way that's going to work ... is to move quickly.''

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake struck the Ungava Peninsula
of northern Quebec, Baffin Island and the eastern part of the
Northwest Territories on Christmas morning, but no damage or
injuries were reported.
   The quake, which occurred at 9:24 a.m. EST, measured 6.2 on the
Richter scale, said seismologist Robert North of the Ottawa office
of the Geological Survey of Canada.
   ``An earthquake over 6 points is a serious earthquake and can
cause severe damage in a populated area,'' North said.
   ``But fortunately the quake ... took place in a sparsely
populated area which has no large buildings, so the effects should
not cause any personal damage,'' he said.
   North said his office received a telephone call from the Inuit
village of Igloolik to report the quake. Iqaluit, on Frobisher Bay
in Baffin Island, also felt the temblor.
   Father Paul-Emile Tremblay, director of the Seismological
Observatory at Montreal's Jean de Brebeuf College, said the
epicenter was in the eastern part of the Northwest Territories and
the quake was felt within a 620-mile radius.
   ``We have been noticing low-level tremors in that area for some
time, so we were not surprised by the strong earthquake which
occurred on Christmas morning,'' he said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.

<LEADPARA>  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney proposed changes to the constitution today that
would recognize Quebec as a "distinct society," provide for an elected Senate
and allow Indians and Inuit self-government.;   The purpose of the
constitutional overhaul is "to build a stronger, more prosperous Canada where
all Canadians can feel at home," the Conservative prime minister told the
House of Commons.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  'DISTINCT SOCIETY' IN QUEBEC CALLED FOR IN CANADA
PLAN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "These changes add up to a renewal that is long overdue. And renewal is
what Canadians everywhere seek for our country -- not confrontation, not
division, not rupture.";   The "distinct society" proposal is likely to be the
most controversial. A similar idea is what sank an effort at constitutional
reform 15 months ago. That package, known as the Meech Lake accords, failed to
win the necessary unanimous ratification of all 10 Canadian provinces.;  
Quebec viewed the failure of Meech Lake as a rejection by English Canada and
the provincial government went ahead with measures calling for a referendum on
sovereignty by October 1992 if a new deal isn't forthcoming.;   Mulroney's
proposal includes a distinct society provision in both the Charter of Rights
and Freedoms, Canada's Bill of Rights, and a new "Canada clause" to the
constitution which defines what makes Canada what it is.;   "I am sure
Quebecers will see in today's proposal the possibility of achieving the
fundamental reform that Quebec needs to evolve as a distinct society within
Canada," Mulroney said.;   French-speaking Quebec, home to nearly 7 million of
Canada's 26 million people, long has felt under linguistic and cultural siege
by the English Canadians on all sides.;   Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe
Clark has said that "distinct society" only recognizes constitutionally what
has been the reality since before confederation in 1867.;   The Quebec
provincial government of Premier Robert Bourassa has said it would have no
immediate reaction to the proposals.;   Liberal Leader Jean Chretien, in his
speech to the Commons, welcomed the principles for reform outlined by
Mulroney, but stopped short of endorsing the package. "Indeed, our first
impression is that the proposals of the government need a great deal of work,"
Chretien said.;   Outside the House chamber, Chretien said the Liberals "will
study the proposition. We will make some suggestions.";   Audrey McLaughlin,
leader of the New Democratic Party, was distressed that the proposals "made no
mention of the need to entrench social rights" in the constitution.;   The
Mulroney government has asked opposition parties to give the measures a chance
and not reject them immediately.;   The package of proposals will be turned
over to a joint committee of the House of Commons and Senate which will tour
the country seeking public comment. Its report is due by Feb. 28.;   The
measures are expected to change the 1982 constitution, which Quebec never
signed but is bound by.;   The proposals provide for an elected Senate, which
is now appointed by the government. Provincial representation would be decided
later. The elected Senate would have a limited veto power over legislation.;  
Mulroney said there is a new commitment to Canada's 500,000 Indians and Inuit
-- or Eskimos -- to give them self-government within 10 years.;   Ottawa is
seeking more power in the proposals to tear down barriers to interprovincial
trade.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Prime Minister Signs Historic Pact To Give Indians Arctic Tract</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar figures U.S.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   RAE-EDZO, Northwest Territories (AP) _ Two native groups in the
Arctic will become the largest non-government landholders in North
America under a historic agreement signed by Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney.
   The long-delayed agreement, signed in this tiny community 200
miles south of the Arctic Circle on the shores of Great Slave Lake,
will give the Denes and Metis Indian nations nearly 4,000 square
miles of land and special rights to an area the size of Oklahoma.
   Mulroney said the signing marked a ``day of justice'' and
heralds ``new economic and political development'' for the north.
But native leaders say many specifics must be negotiated before a
final pact is signed in two years.
   Monday's agreement gives about 15,000 natives of the Dene and
Metis Indian nations ownership and oil and mineral rights to about
3,850 square miles of the rocky bush land bordering the Arctic
Ocean.
   It would also give them special rights and interests _ including
a voice in wildlife, forestry and land management _ for a nearly
70,000 square miles area.
   The agreement, which followed 15 years of negotiations, includes
a $405 million cash settlement that would be paid out over 20 years
beginning in 1990 _ the year negotiators hope to have a final
settlement.
   ``This agreement of principle, when carried forward to its final
form, will establish a new, stronger and healthier relationship
between the people of this area and the governments which serve
them,'' said Mulroney, who was welcomed with the beat of drums and
a ceremonial prayer chant.
   He added that the agreement marks ``real progress'' in the Dene
quest for self-determination.
   But the chief of the Dene nation warned that Ottawa and native
leaders must still negotiate issues such as aboriginal title and
self-government.
   ``We will be seeking changes before we reach the final
agreement,'' Bill Erasmus told about 1,000 Dogrib Indians on the
steps of the village's Roman Catholic church.
   The Dogribs are the largest of seven groups making up the Dene
nation.
   Ottawa said the Dene handed over their aboriginal rights when
they signed 1899 and 1921 treaties.
   But the Dene contend they never gave up their aboriginal rights
and, under Monday's agreement, are handing over some of their land
in return for financial compensation and the guarantee of hunting
and fishing rights.
   Mike Paulette, president of the Northwest Territories Metis
Association, said he was sure ``we can now negotiate a satisfactory
deal within the next two years.''
   Mulroney's visit to Rae-Edzo, 65 miles northwest of the
territorial capital of Yellowknife, marked his first trip to the
Northwest Territories since his Conservatives gained power four
years ago.

<TEXT>
   In a landmark decision
Tuesday, a judge found four Eskimos innocent of charges of public
mischief arising from protests of low-level NATO flights over their
traditional hunting grounds.
   ``I am satisfied that the four believe their ancestors predate
any Canadian claims to ancestry on this land,'' Judge James
Igloliorte told a makeshift courtroom set up in the community hall
of this Labrador village.
   ``Through their knowledge of ancestry and kinship, they have
shown that none of their people ever gave away rights to the land
to Canada.''
   Daniel Ashini, chief of the local Innu band of Eskimos; Ben
Michel, a band council member; Elizabeth Penashue; and her son,
Peter Penashue _ were accused of entering the runway area at the
Goose Bay air base in September to protest the flights by Canada,
West Germany, Britain and the Netherlands.
   The provincial court judge, himself an Innu, accepted defense
arguments that the four held an ``honest belief'' that the land on
which the airbase is located belongs to the Eskimos, and therefore
they committed no wrong.
   The judge urged a political settlement to the dispute between
the Ottawa government and the Eskimos over the NATO flights and
simulated bombing runs the natives say have made a battleground of
the territory they claim as a homeland.
   Igloliorte said the government ``must negotiate answers to their
problems since the court is unable to answer these problems for
them.''
   Native leaders hailed the ruling as a victory. The government
gave no indication on whether it would appeal the decision.
   After the verdict, the four accused jumped to their feet and
clapped, as did the 150 Eskimo men, women and children who attended
the three-day trial earlier this month.
   The ruling ``calls on Canada to enter into a new era of
relations with the Innu (Eskimo)'' said a beaming Ashini. ``The era
of extinction of rights through an unjust land claims process is
over.''
   James O'Reilly, a native affairs lawyer, termed the judgment a
significant victory for the native people of Canada.
   ``The fact that (the judge) would recognize traditional rights
as being sufficient to override arguments of national defense is
certainly a first, as far as I can see,'' he said in an interview
from Montreal.

<HEAD>Northwest Indians Reject Record Offer of Land, Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAY RIVER RESERVE, Northwest Territories (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of
15,000 native Indians in Canada's Northwest Territories have
rejected a land claim offer from the federal government.
   All but four of the 300 delegates to a special joint assembly
voted Sunday to reject the offer of $500 million ($415 million
U.S.) in cash and the use of 72,000 square miles of land in the
Mackenzie River region.
   Leaders of the Dene Indians and the northern Metis _ who are
half-descended from French fur traders _ called for more
negotiations with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, setting a two-year
deadline for agreement.
   About 1,000 Indians gathered for a week at Hay River Indian
reservation for the heated debate over whether to accept a
tentative agreement reached in May after protracted negotiations.
   Some bands wanted to sign the agreement because of the toll
taken by poverty, alcoholism and other chronic problems on Indian
settlements.
   But other groups demanded a broader agreement including
provisions for self-government and clear title to their ancestral
land. In the end, there were only three dissenting votes and one
abstention.
   Georges Erasmus, president of the Assembly of First Nations
which represents all Canadian Indians, urged Dene leaders not to
``nail themselves to the cross'' of the federal offer. Anyone too
tired to continue fighting for their rights should step down, he
said.
   The assembly called for a meeting with Mulroney and Indian
Affairs Minister Bill McKnight to renegotiate areas such as
self-government, aboriginal title, taxation and water rights.
   In a letter to the Dene and Metis last week, McKnight termed the
deal the government's last offer and demanded a decision by July
15. He warned that Ottawa may not be willing to reopen negotiations.
   The Snare Lakes Indian band leader, Alexis Arrowmaker, said he
is willing to take that chance. ``We are powerful, we're strong
enough to talk to any government.''
   The Dene live below the timber line in a wintry region rich in
fish, game and mineral resources. Many follow a traditional way of
life by trapping for furs and hunting caribou.
   The original Dene and Meti negotiators of the land claim said
ownership of 72,000 square miles _ an area larger than North Dakota
_ would have made their people the largest private landholders in
North America.
   The government would have retained oil and mineral rights
underneath most of it, but the Indians were offered subsurface
rights for 3,200 square miles.
   In addition, the government promised continued hunting, trapping
and fishing rights on another 480,000 square miles of Crown land,
stretching from the borders of Alberta and Saskatchewan to above
the Arctic Circle.

A joint U.S. and Soviet national park and wilderness preserve is being planned 
for the land on both sides of the Bering Straits, where Siberia and Alaska are 
only 80 miles apart. It has already been dubbed the "Glasnost and Glaciers" 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Ecologists and park officials in both countries have agreed that the region is 
best treated as an ecological whole, and that joint management of the area is 
the best way to protect the wildlife and the wilderness and to guard against 
pollution, including oil spills, in this fragile environment, where winter ends 
in early May and resumes at the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
This human attempt to see the region as a whole echoes the geological past, 
when the Asian and American continents were joined by a land bridge across the 
Bering Straits, across which America's first human inhabitants are believed to 
have migrated. 
</P>
<P>
Although the boundaries for the park have yet to be drawn up, and plans for 
tourist access and management rules are in the early stages, enthusiastic 
scientists from both countries are planning joint research programs into 
migration patterns and breeding zones. 
</P>
<P>
The only access to this region is by dog sled, boat, four-wheel drive, 
helicopter or float plane. But in spite of the remoteness, reminders of the 
modern world are near enough, in the U.S. military base and radar station at 
Nome, and in the matching array of Soviet security installations in Magadan 
Province. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Single Ecosystem' 
</P>
<P>
"The Bering Sea happens to be divided by a political boundary, but it should be 
recognized and managed as a single ecosystem," said Curtis Bohlen, a vice 
president of the World Wildlife Fund, and one of the promoters of the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contribution to the venture is expected to be a large part of the Nome 
Peninsula known as the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. The Soviet Union 
has a series of ecologically protected zones, rather than a formal national 
park service, but Soviet ecologists have lately been examining the U.S. and the 
British national park systems to see which best suits their conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent spur to this cooperation on the roof of the world was the 
Alaska oil spill disaster, when a purpose-built oil-skimming Russian ship was 
sent to help clear up the 11 million gallons of crude oil that gushed from the 
Exxon Valdez supertanker. 
</P>
<P>
With further oil exploration already going on off Alaska's Barrow Peninsula, 
and with the Soviets starting to drill in their own Arctic coastal zones, 
concern about more oil pollution has intensified the contacts between U.S. and 
Soviet ecologists. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea of an Arctic park was first raised in the 1960s, U.S.-Soviet 
cooperation in this neighborly Arctic region has progressed with remarkable 
speed since the coming of glasnost. Earlier this year, U.S. and Soviet 
officials agreed that the Inuit natives of both sides would be allowed to come 
and go without bothering with the tedious formalities of bureaucratic 
civilization such as visas. An Alaskan airline now flies a regular service back 
and forth to the Siberian town of Providenya. 
</P>
<P>
And in this Alaska territory, which was a province of the Czar's Empire until 
it was sold for hard cash in the 1860s, Soviet architectural historians have 
begun helping with the restoration of old Russian Orthodox churches.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Arts: Controller takes the hot seat - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRUE democrat, Michael Green, Controller of Radio 4, submitted himself on
Sunday to half an hour's telephoned comment on his network. The lines had
already been open for two hours, so no doubt the comments we heard were only
a few of those made. How else account for a mere two criticisms of the
morning-timed Woman's Hour? One of them complained simply of inability to
hear it at its new time, or even at the evening repeat at 7.20 pm to be
tried for six months. The other reckoned that the programme had begun to
deal with women's general, ie feminist, rather than domestic, interests.
The most important complaint made was surely the inability to receive FM
signals in some areas. Things would be better during the 1990s, Mr Green
promised. Or perhaps we must wait half a decade for DAB, or digital audio
broadcasting. Most of the other complaints were matters of taste. Reporters'
voices in the news bulletins were too 'magazine-y', there were too many old
comedy items like quizzes, there was too much nostalgia, there should be
more listener-involvement (like phone-ins), there was too much background
music in the plays, there were too many repeats, too much obsession with
politics.
The Controller kept his end up well enough and promised to take notes of
what was raised. Hardly had he ended than a violin began the background
music for the repeat of Planche's play The Garrick Fever, a delightful
comedy about an ambitious young Irishman playing Hamlet in place of the
absent star (there was no more music, though). Then followed the first of a
political series, The Power and the Glory, in which James Naughtie examines
American leadership. Two excellent programmes.
Nostalgia followed almost at once, in a series on the Gulf fighting, The
Desert War, and in Concerto, a reminiscent interview with Moura Lympany; but
I doubt if the objection was meant to include all such memories. For serious
nostalgia we had to wait for the first programme in Never the Same Again on
Tuesday (a repeat), and the second programme on Thursday morning. The series
deals with 'critical periods in family life', and the general sentiment is
self-pity. I find this an unattractive sentiment, however accountable,
especially when flaunted as a sort of entertainment.
With respect to Mr Green, I find the best drama on Radio 3 as a rule, but
this week they repeated two plays about which I have already written fairly
lately. On Sunday we had the interesting Much Ado about Nothing directed by
Clive Brill, with its cultural range of voices - Afro-Caribbean sounds for
the Fairies and RADA sounds for the Greeks, well worth its second hearing.
On Tuesday came a repeat of Anthony Burgess's A Meeting in Valladolid, a
fantasy about a meeting between Shakespeare and Cervantes, which has already
been broadcast all over Europe in 13 languages, and I would have thought
that enough.
By way of total contrast, Radio 4 gave us Chris Galer's Manikudlak and the
Bear on Thursday, part of the channel's current Northern Lights Festival.
Set in Greenland, this was about an Inuit (Meredith Edwards) and his young
nephew (Marc Heatley), who go hunting together. Manikudlak hears voices, of
the Sea-mother who lives at the bottom of the sea waiting for men to come
and comb her hair, and of the days of his youth. The boy is not interested
in such old stories and goes home on his own after a bear has been sighted
but Manikudlak has jammed his rifle. The bear is in fact a revival of the
bear that Manikudlak and his brother had killed years before, and in whose
gutted body he had sheltered from an ice-storm. Now the brothers are
reunited. The play mixes fact and folk-tale throughout in this pleasant if
not always expert way. The director was Jane Dauncey.
There were more Inuits elsewhere in the week, with more to come, dealing
with the cultures of the peoples living on the Arctic rim - all pretty new
to most of us, I suspect.

   The Supreme Court today rejected a challenge
to the rates being charged for transporting oil through the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
   The justices, without comment, left intact a rate agreement
between Alaska and the pipeline's eight owners.
   The rates were challenged by the Arctic Slope Regional Corp.,
established under Alaska law to protect the rights of Inupiat
Eskimos.
   Lawyers for Arctic said the pipeline rate agreement, which
extends through the year 2011, ``will have a critical effect on the
development and cost of oil from the Alaska North Slope, an energy
resource vital to our nation's economy and security.''
   After large reserves of oil were discovered on Alaska's North
Slope in 1969, eight oil companies constructed an 800-mile pipeline
to the all-weather port of Valdez on the state's Pacific coast.
   The pipeline was completed in 1977, at a cost of some $9 billion.
   The Alaska law, aimed at promoting oil production, extinguished
the land claims of native Alaskans by compensating them with money.
   Arctic is one of 13 regional corporations given ownership of
lands formerly held by natives. Arctic leases much of its 4.5
million acres for the benefit of its Inupiat Eskimo shareholders.
   Oil from Arctic's lands likely will start being shipped through
the pipeline sometime in the 1990s, and the oil's value to Arctic
will be reduced dollar-for-dollar by charges levied for
transporting it.
   After nine years of administrative proceedings, Alaska and the
pipeline's eight owners reached a rate agreement in 1986.
   Arctic attempted to challenge the agreement, contending that the
per-barrel rates it yielded are too high.
   But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the
agreement as uncontested after ruling that Arctic was not
``particularly aggrieved'' by the pipeline rates.
   A federal appeals court here upheld the commission ruling last
Oct. 27 after noting that the rate agreement is not binding on
Arctic, and that Arctic is free to challenge the rates once oil
from its lands begin to pass through the pipeline.
   ``Arctic can properly be left out in the cold for the moment,''
the appeals court ruled, adding, ``The commission acted within its
lawful authority and discretion in closing a long and wearisome
chapter in the saga of (Trans-Alaska Pipeline) rate regulation.''
   The pipeline's owners are Amerada Hess, Arco, BP, Exxon, Mobil,
Phillips, Sohio and Unocal.
   The case is Arctic Slope Regional Corp. vs. FERC, 87-1869.

<TEXT>
   ``Despite ANCSA and its millions, native people who had little
money before 1971 have little money today,'' said Thomas Berger, a
former British Columbia Supreme Court judge who spent two years
interviewing villagers across Alaska for the Inuit Circumpolar
Conference.
   Unemployment remains high in Alaska's villages. Alcoholism is
widespread, as liquor fuels the depression of a younger generation
skilled in neither the old subsistence traditions nor the modern
ways of a technological society. Alaska's young native men, aged 14
to 24, kill themselves at a rate four times the national average, a
recent study found.
   Disappointment in the corporate experiment turned to outrage
when it became obvious it could eventually lead to the loss of
native lands. ANCSA banned the sale of stock to non-natives until
1991, but natives realized their corporations would be diluted and
their land could slip from their grasp after that.
   The Yupiit Nation was born in this atmosphere of fear. In the
summer of 1984, Kasayulie and about 40 other native leaders drew up
a declaration of independence from outside forces.
   ``Our people have been in control for so many thousands of
years, determining their own destiny. With the advance of Western
society, the rules changed,'' he said.
   Native sovereignty is a way to change the rules back again, he
said.
   For example, Akiachak's panel of elders may confiscate a man's
riverboat if they find him guilty of disturbing the peace. If he
needs it for fishing to feed his family, they're likely to return
it, Kasayulie said.
   Tribal council meetings are conducted in Yupik, the language of
choice for most villagers, and great deference is paid to the
elders, Kasayulie said.
   Akiachak's brightest teen-agers can stay in the village these
days, attending a modern high school that features both computer
labs and lessons on building dog sleds.
   But Akiachak's tribal government is still underground as far as
state officials are concerned. The state won't budge on most tribal
issues, partly because sovereignty would discriminate against
whites living in predominantly native villages, said Douglas Mertz,
an assistant state attorney general.
   ``Non-natives would not have the right to participate in the
government,'' he said. ``They wouldn't have effective recourse if
their civil rights were violated. In fact, they could be booted out
of the community, even if they owned property and had lived there
all their lives.''
   State officials also worry that if each of Alaska's 200 native
villages sets up a separate jurisdiction, the result would be a
jumble of tax, environmental, and hunting and fishing regulations.
   Mertz is juggling a half-dozen cases involving tribal
sovereignty, and he expects to see more.
   That's because the courts have inherited the question from
Congress, which last winter amended the Claims Settlement Act. The
amendments continued the restrictions on stock ownership
indefinitely, relieving some of the natives' concerns, but
lawmakers rejected pleas to include language bolstering sovereignty
claims.
   So far, the courts have sent mixed signals concerning
sovereignty.
   Tribal advocates applauded the federal district court's 1986
decision upholding Tyonek's immunity.
   But the sovereignty movement was dealt a blow in May, when the
Alaska Supreme Court said Tyonek was an exception because it
occupied a reservation, later dissolved, in the 1930s. The court
said other Alaska villages are ineligible to claim sovereign
immunity because Congress never treated them as reservations or
tribes.
   Mertz said it would take more than one court case to untangle
the legal thicket surrounding native sovereignty. ``The one thing
about Indian law is that there are no certainties, and Indian law
in Alaska is even more that way,'' he said.
   Akiachak is not waiting for final word from the courts. Perhaps
the best argument for tribal sovereignty, Kasayulie said, is that
it works.
   ``If there's to be any dispute from the state or federal
government, let them prove that our tribal governments aren't
functioning,'' he said.
   ``I think they should make a comparison between tribal
government and city government to find out who is more responsible
to the villagers. I think they'd find the tribal government is
operating better than the city, even though we're operating with
less money.''

Angeles Times, grew up in Montreal.

<P>
Leaning on a cane, Canadian firebrand Mordecai Richler hobbled into the lobby 
of Montreal's posh Ritz-Carlton Hotel. The 59-year-old writer had taken a spill 
on the ice outside of his country home on Lac Memphremagog, a resort lake 
straddling the U.S. border in Quebec's Eastern Townships. 
</P>
<P>
"These winters are punishing," acknowledged the bruised but otherwise 
unflappable Montreal native, whose first novel in a decade, "Solomon Gursky Was 
Here," was greeted last year by critics in his country as the most significant 
event in recent Canadian publishing. 
</P>
<P>
By late February, the Canadian edition, published by Penguin Books of Canada, 
had sold 38,000 copies of a 40,000 print run. The novel was also offered as a 
Canadian Book of the Month Club selection, requiring the printing of an 
additional 20,000 copies. In a country of 25 million, a quarter of whom speak 
French, this was an impressive showing. 
</P>
<P>
"Solomon Gursky" also spent a couple of months on the Toronto Globe and Mail 
best-seller list, earning Richler a cover review in the prestigious magazine 
Books in Canada, and frequent citations in the Canadian newsmagazine Macleans, 
in Saturday Night and in other premium Canadian periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
Richler's books have rarely done this well, proportionately, in the United 
States. But they have always been well received critically. 
</P>
<P>
Released this month in the United States by Knopf, "Solomon Gursky" is a 
556-page family saga, replete with the usual Richler satire and savagery, about 
a boozy writer's lifelong obsession with the doings of a larger-than-life 
Jewish-Canadian patriarch and his offspring. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects the protagonist is a Richler stand-in. And the family is a 
fictional model of the formerly bootlegging, now-legitimate Bronfman clan of 
Montreal, whose doings Canadians regard with almost the same fascination 
Americans have for Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Descendants of a prosperous Russian-Jewish immigrant, the Bronfman family owns 
and controls an enormous and diversified financial empire. In the United 
States, they are best known as the owners of Joseph E. Seagram and Sons. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bronfmans were certainly the trigger," Richler acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"Solomon Gurksy" ranges from Victorian London to the Canadian Arctic, from the 
Depression years on the Canadian Prairie to present-day New York. For Richler, 
who has been particular about setting his best books in the Quebec of his youth 
and, occasionally, in London, this has been a change. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the plot's many little tricks, Richler depicts the fictionalized 
patriarch, Ephraim Gursky, as an escaped British convict who survives one of 
history's most inane attempts to locate the elusive Northwest Passage. Gursky 
subsequently converts the native Inuit to his own lusty brand of Orthodox 
Judaism. The more literal-minded of his adherents, however, are almost driven 
to extinction while trying to comply with the Jewish prohibition against eating 
or drinking until the sun goes down on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. In the 
Arctic, it takes the sun takes half a year to set. 
</P>
<P>
"Solomon Gursky Was Here" has had the added effect of thrusting the acerbic 
Richler himself back into the literary limelight just as critics had begun to 
suspect -- or in some cases hope -- that he might have mellowed. 
</P>
<P>
Bronwyn Drainie, a columnist for the Toronto Globe and Mail, recently noted 
that for Canada's normally genteel literary community, this truly was "the 
winter of public discontent." Few could recall the eruption of so many flaps, 
spats and hissing matches. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do so many of these controversies seem to center on Richler, especially 
when he doesn't go looking for them?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
On his permafrost-ridden home turf, the prickly Richler is a caustic social 
critic who makes Southern California's curmudgeon, Harlan Ellison, seem like 
Mr. Rogers. If Richler inspires equal degrees of loathing in some circles, 
suggests Canadian chronicler John Robert Colombo, perhaps the country's ranking 
anthologist, it may be because he is too worldly, too openly Jewish, too urban 
and too outspoken to suit some super-patriots in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"Although very much engaged in Canadian life and politics," observed Colombo, 
"Richler has always been a thorn in the sides of nationalists in both English 
and French Canada. He is particularly adept at showing the world how absurdly 
both camps can behave." 
</P>
<P>
Richler is, in fact, more outspokenly Canadian in outlook today than ever. But 
he maintains a distinctly Jewish ambivalence toward excessive patriotism -- 
even toward Israeli nationalism -- which he regards as narrow, insular and 
never terribly healthy for minorities. In a country such as Canada, which took 
98 years to settle on a flag of its own, overt displays of nationalism are, 
Richler has observed, even slightly ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
If he wished to, Richler could spare himself the grueling Quebec winters by 
joining the million or so other snowbirds and Canadian expatriates in the 
Southern California sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
During a 20-year self-imposed exile in London (with sojourns in France, Spain 
and Hollywood and frequent visits home), Richler had achieved a certain degree 
of success as a screenwriter and novelist. His screenplay for "Life at the 
Top," which starred Jean Simmons and the late Lawrence Harvey, was well 
received. He also worked on "Room at the Top." The script he adapted from his 
seminal novel, "The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz" a few years after 
returning to Montreal in 1972, was nominated for an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Richler learned about the Oscar nomination while visiting Yellowknife, in the 
Northwest Territories. In Yellowknife, the temperature outdoors was 42 below 
zero. But the reception awaiting him at his first Hollywood party was, he would 
discover, no less chilly. 
</P>
<P>
"To mention the Arctic, where I had just come from," he recounted in "Home 
Sweet Home," a collection of essays published five years ago by Knopf, "was to 
watch eyes glaze over in boredom, until I finally learned to say not that I had 
just come down from Yellowknife, but that I had returned from location in 
Yellowknife." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oh really? What are they shooting there?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Caribou.' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite his cheek, Richler was later called back to work on the film "Fun With 
Dick and Jane," a prospect he greeted with ambivalence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a day like this, lots of snow, and I said, 'OK, I'll come down. But I 
don't want to meet with any producers, I won't take meetings, and I want a 
first-class ticket for my wife.' They didn't balk at any of my requests, but 
they thought the last one was the funniest thing they ever heard -- this 
strange Canadian backwoodsman actually wanted his wife to come with him." 
</P>
<P>
Richler returned permanently to his homeland in 1972 because he feared his 
literary vision could not survive the separation from his Canadian roots any 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't write novels set in England because I wasn't brought up there," 
said Richler. "I, like (Trinidad-born novelist V. S.) Naipaul, don't know what 
an Englishman does when he goes home at night. I saw writers I knew and 
respected, like Doris Lessing and Dan Jacobson, setting novels in biblical and 
far-future times. I figured I'd better go home before that happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
England's and Hollywood's loss has become Canada's gain. John Fraser, the 
editor of Saturday Night, Canada's preeminent magazine of politics, art and 
culture and a frequent publisher of Richler's journalism, has characterized 
"Solomon Gursky" as "vintage, mature Richler." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Richler's previous novels have been rooted in the people and places of 
the Montreal Jewish ghetto of his youth. Richler was the child of Jewish 
immigrants from Russia who quickly steeled themselves against the frigid north 
winds as well as the equally frosty regard in which they were held by the 
province's French-speaking Catholic majority and its almost equally 
disapproving Anglophone minority. 
</P>
<P>
Richler grew up in the St. Urbain Street Jewish ghetto warmly evoked in his 
novels, an impoverished, insular world that was not, however, without charm. 
Many of the places Richler popularized in his book -- the Bagel Factory, for 
instance, and the late Moe Wilensky's corner sandwich store, where a quarter 
once bought a "special" and a Cherry Coke -- have, because of Richler, become 
Montreal icons. 
</P>
<P>
In books like "The Street," "St. Urbain's Horseman," "Joshua Then And Now" and 
"Duddy Kravitz," Richler has kept the period of his youth -- from the start of 
World War II through the early 1950s -- vibrantly alive. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my time, my place," Richler has said, "and I have elected myself to 
get it right." According to one critic, he has brought "his native city of 
Montreal to life as no writer has been able to do before." 
</P>
<P>
He has done so, however, often to the intense discomfort of his fellow Jews, 
who do not always appreciate being reminded -- or having Richler remind others 
-- of their humble origins. Indeed, Richler's relationship with other Montreal 
Jews has been prickliest of all. Many think Mordecai Richler's books and 
pronouncements inspire anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
Richler's readiness to expound irreverently on matters of grave national 
portent have won him few friends in government, federal or provincial. His 
slightest quips tend to make national headlines. Residents of Edmonton, 
Alberta, may never forgive him for saying theirs was a great town if they ever 
decided to uncrate it. 
</P>
<P>
In "Solomon Gursky," a character describes Canada as "a holding tank filled 
with the disgruntled progeny of defeated peoples." 
</P>
<P>
Passages like this, acknowledges Richler, get cited in the Canadian press and 
have earned him most of his notoriety. But Richler's most deadly venom is saved 
for his native Quebec. He is particularly bitter over what he sees as the 
emasculation by Quebec of the province's English-speaking minority, which 
Richler characterizes -- Jew and Gentile alike -- as "gutless." 
</P>
<P>
"For God's sake, they have grown men in the provincial bureaucracy running 
around with tape measures, trying to determine whether the few English-language 
signs permitted in public places use letters that are smaller than those in 
French. 
</P>
<P>
"Future generations," Richler says, "will laugh at our obsessions. We are not 
living through tragedy but farce. If this country flies apart from such 
matters, at least foreigners will find some comic relief in Canada's plight." 
</P>
<P>
Richler believes such comments have earned him the enduring enmity of Quebec 
premier Robert Bourassa, although Bourassa does not speak publicly about 
Richler. Richler has not only held Bourassa up to ridicule within Canada, but 
also has made his government a laughingstock in such prominent American forums 
as the New Yorker, Harper's and the Atlantic Monthly, for which Richler writes 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, these positions have not earned Richler the love of English 
Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys hate Richler," said Colombo, "because he championed the free trade 
deal with the U.S., which most Canadians now regard as a blatant sellout of our 
sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the United States permits, for the first time in Canadian 
history, the relatively free flow of goods and services. Many Canadians believe 
that the protectionism had held Canada, despite its intense regional 
divisiveness, together as a national entity. Without it, Canadians fear the 
commercial and cultural tug of the American behemoth will prove greater than 
the bond among the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Richler has traditionally disparaged Canada's cultural and economic 
protectionism as "tiresome." 
</P>
<P>
"No heritage is worth preserving," he has written, "unless it can survive the 
sun, the mixed marriage, or the foreign periodical." 
</P>
<P>
This position may have been behind Canadian novelist Farley Mowat's savaging of 
Richler in a Toronto weekly this year in a manner some have characterized as 
anti-Semitic. A self-described "chauvinist-nationalist" (who achieved notoriety 
in the United States in 1985 after U.S. customs officials refused him entry 
because of his conservationist activities), Mowat called Richler a 
"non-Canadian" with a Jewish and neighborhood identity but "no sense of 
Canadian identity at all." By attacking Richler's alleged "cosmopolitanism," as 
one critic characterized the quality Mowat objects to, Mowat, wittingly or 
otherwise, used the historical language of anti-Semitism, propagating the 
canard of an innate Jewish incompatibility with patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
But John Fraser, who once spent three weeks in the bush with the author of 
"Never Cry Wolf," does not believe Mowat was intentionally anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
Mowat, notes Fraser, "is a merely another small-town Protestant, who probably 
holds the usual small-town Protestant view of Jews." He is also, according to 
Colombo, a pastoralist who celebrates the virtues of the Canadian wilderness 
and has fantasized in his writing about staging a heroic last stand of loyal 
Canadians against encroaching American imperialists at James Bay. Richler, an 
avowed city slicker and alleged Yank-lover, had populated Mowat's beloved 
Arctic with talisman-sporting, Yiddish-singing Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
The acclaim given Richler's new book was also apparently too much for the three 
judges of Canada's prestigious Governor-General's Award for Literature. Despite 
its ample critical and commercial success, "Solomon Gursky" not only didn't 
win; it wasn't even nominated. 
</P>
<P>
"That it didn't even make the list," said Fraser, "has more to do with politics 
and the motivations of the judges than it does with Richler or his book. I've 
had a look at the competitors, and to me this was madness." 
</P>
<P>
Richler has declined to comment publicly either about the Mowat flap or the 
snubbing of his book. He is at work on another volume of essays and will soon 
begin a new novel. Mostly, though, he says he is content to sit by his fire on 
the frozen shores of Lac Memphremagog, reading quietly and talking with his 
wife, Florence. Montreal, a city he recognizes as sadly diminished in recent 
years as much of the money and talent fled west and south, is a place he now 
visits for a day each week.

<HEAD>Free Trade Agreement Renews Debate Over Exporting Water To The
U.S.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

   The proposals are Gargantuan: a 400-mile Grand
Canal from the icy rivers of northern Canada to the Great Lakes, or
an irrigation trench through the Rocky Mountains to the parched
American West.
   Could the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, now in the process
of ratification, make such massive diversions of fresh water a
reality?
   The subject was debated Thursday when two Canadian experts
disclosed that the trade agreement treats water like newsprint,
computers and other ``goods'' now subject to tariffs.
   The treaty will eliminate those tariffs and offer the United
States ``national treatment'' when it comes to Canadian water, said
former trade negotiator Mel Clark and Don Gamble of the Rawson
Academy of Aquatic Science in Ottawa.
   The discovery, they said, contradicts claims by the Conservative
government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that water was not part
of the trade deal.
   When questioned in Parliament, Trade Minister John Crosbie
indirectly confirmed that water exports are possible under the
treaty.
   But Crosbie told opponents that Canada cannot be forced to sell
water or any other natural resource.
   ``We are not obliged to sell one thimbleful of (water) to the
United States,'' he said, citing a federal announcement last
November that large-scale water diversions will not be contemplated.
   Frank Quinn of the government's Inland Waters Directorate told
The Associated Press that Canada wanted water exempted from the
trade deal but abandoned the demand in final compromises with U.S.
negotiators.
   ``In the 11th hour, we didn't get all the changes we wanted,''
he said.
   Quinn said the world General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
which both countries recognize, allows a member to ban exports of
natural resources on grounds of conservation and environmental
protection.
   On that basis, he said, Canada will not permit diversions of
fresh water.
   Quinn said Canada's pledge under the Free Trade Agreement to
share energy resources in times of crisis only covers items
currently exported, such as gas and oil.
   ``We're not now exporting water, only dribs and drabs,'' he said.
   Border towns in Alberta, Manitoba and New Brunswick export small
quantities to local water systems in Montana, North Dakota and
Maine, and there are proposals to export water by tanker from
British Columbia and Quebec.
   In any case, Quinn said, even the thirstiest U.S. states are no
longer considering long-distance diversions because of the cost.
Instead, they are focusing on a transition from agricultural to
municipal use of local water.
   Should the United States run dry, Canada does seem a handy
solution.
   With 7 percent of the world's land area, Canada has 9 percent of
its renewable fresh water supply and only 1 percent of its
population. Eight percent of the country is covered by lakes.
   The problem is that 60 percent of the water flows north toward
the Arctic and is inaccessible to most Canadians, who live huddled
near the U.S. border.
   Thus the grand schemes.
   Newfoundland engineer Tom Kierans has spent 30 years promoting
his dream of turning Arizona desert into lush farmland with water
diverted from the rivers of northern Quebec and Ontario, now
flowing north into James Bay.
   Pumping stations would propel the water into a Grand Canal
across the Canadian Shield to the Ottawa River and on to Lake
Huron. From the Great Lakes, it would be pumped to the prairies and
desert. The estimated cost of construction alone: $100 billion.
   The same pricetag was put on a 1964 idea proposed by Ralph M.
Parsons Ltd., California engineers, to divert the Yukon and
McKenzie rivers through the Rocky Mountain Trench of western Canada
into the United States.
   A comprehensive Canadian study in 1985 advised a ``cautious
approach'' to such projects but called it ``imprudent to reject all
exports out of hand.''
   The author of that report, Professor Peter Pearse of the
University of British Columbia, told the AP the Grand Canal was
``not in anybody's interest on ecological or economic grounds.''
   He said it would cost $2,000 per thousand cubic meters simply to
get the water to the U.S. Southwest.
   Environmentalists oppose transferring water from one basin to
another because of the ecological impact and disruption to Indians
and Inuit dependent on fishing and hunting.
   ``It's always been a fear that this is on somebody's agenda,''
said Julia Langer, Canadian director of the Friends of the Earth.
``We haven't paid enough attention to real water conservation to be
even considering these kinds of megaprojects.''

Question: I inherited a large coin collection along with some dollar bills 
about five years ago. The collection involves probably 30,000 coins including 
some junk silver, a lot of rolls of uncirculated pennies from the '60s and many 
fairly rare pieces, including American and foreign gold and silver dollars. The 
collection is much too large and valuable to just load up and take to a dealer 
for evaluation. I am wondering how one would go about liquidating such a 
collection. It is located in a small community in the Midwest. Frankly, I am 
worried about getting ripped off, as I have no idea who can be trusted. -- T.B. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The first rule in a situation such as yours is: Trust no one. The 
second rule is: Learn as much about coins and coin pricing as you can. Simply 
stated, coins are priced on the basis of rarity and condition. Rarity is 
determined by the date, mint mark and denomination of a coin. Condition is 
determined subjectively, with experts often finding themselves in honest 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, your hoard has some value. To determine a fair market price, you 
should separate the gold from the silver and then sort the coins by 
denomination and date. Prepare an inventory. Do the same with the bills and the 
foreign pieces, separating them by country. After you have a pretty good idea 
of what you own, use some standard pricing guides to get a very rough idea as 
to what they might be worth. 
</P>
<P>
Then, check with some dealers. You might want to show them a sampling of your 
coins. Dealers will travel anywhere if they think it's worthwhile. Have an idea 
as to what you want for your coins and be prepared to sell if the dealer comes 
close to your estimate. 
</P>
<P>
One of the coins could well be worth more than the rest of the 30,000 in your 
collection. But there's only one way to find out. If you do your homework, 
you'll be able to trust your better judgment.

<TEXT>
   Eye-stinging spruce smoke cloaked
dimly lit figures huddled against sub-zero cold at the end of their
first long day of learning the tricks of arctic survival.
   ``Nothin' but a bunch of Boy Scouts with bad language,'' someone
quipped.
   He was partly right. The only scouts were a half-dozen Eskimo
Scouts who teach the military how to stay alive when it gets so cold
that people from the Lower 48 states can't comprehend it.
   The Scouts' weeklong course 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle
is short on lectures and long on cold. At least four full days and
nights are spent in the wilderness 500 miles northeast of Anchorage.
   Now in its third winter, the Alaska Army National Guard school
has trained about 150 people to cope with temperatures that
consistently range in the neighborhood of 40 degrees below zero. It
hit 45 below on the last two nights of January's class, and a couple
days after the students left, Alaska's great cold wave struck with
temperatures down to 50 and 60 below zero.
   Students run the gamut from Army Special Forces troops to raw
National Guard recruits, and Alaska Adjutant General John Schaeffer
says it is not just non-Alaskans and non-natives that need the
training.
   ``The type of Eskimo we're enlisting today doesn't have the
survival skills of the older Eskimos,'' says Schaeffer, a
participant in the January class. He estimates about half of the
Guard is Eskimo or Indian.
   Because of cultural changes, natives no longer have to rely on
the skills handed down for generations, says Schaeffer, an Eskimo
from Kotzebue. ``We've got a bunch of Eskimos and Indians around
here who would have as much trouble (surviving the cold) as anyone
else.''
   Schaeffer, an experienced arctic outdoorsman, says he attended
the class to lend it some credibility and assure its permanency and
funding.
   ``We're doing what we should have been doing for years _ taking
the skills we've learned from centuries of living here and passing
them on,'' the two-star general says.
   The school was started in response to requests from National
Guard flight crews, who wanted training similar to that offered at
the Air Force's ``Cool School'' at Eielson Air Force Base near
Fairbanks.
   Maj. Jerry Finney, the U.S. Army adviser to the 5th Scout
Battalion of the 297th Infantry, got together with an Arctic Village
hunting buddy, Timothy Sam.
   Sam recruited other instructors from the nearby Gwich'in Indian
villages of Venetie and Fort Yukon, and they began showing students
what it takes to survive.
   The practical experiences of the natives are backed by scientific
data from Finney about human physiology and thermodynamics.
   Finney says one of the most difficult survival obstacles is to
overcome the macho approach to the cold. Too often, soldiers are
afraid to admit they are freezing, he says.
   At 40 below zero, severe frostbite can occur within two to four
hours as the result of a series of minor errors or less than an hour
from one serious mistake, Finney says.
   The worst injury in the six previous classes at Arctic Village
involved a Special Forces sergeant who suffered serious frostbite to
nine toes. Part of the cause was an experimental boot, but much of
it was a stubborn unwillingness to acknowledge the cold, Finney says.
   ``Nobody knows better than you if you're cold,'' Finney preaches.
``If you're cold, do something about it. Deal with it.''
   Shelter construction is one of the areas of major emphasis at the
school. Types of shelters depend on the materials at hand, and the
foothills of the Brooks Range near Arctic Village have plentiful
supplies of stunted black spruce.
   Boughs are used for ground insulation and to thatch the sides and
roofs of lean-tos. Limbless trunks become the framework for the
shelters. Wood is gathered for all-night fires.
   Instructors show students how to snare hares and catch fish to
supplement their diet. But this part of Alaska doesn't support a
bunny population large enough to feed two dozen hungry troops.
Ice-fishing is somewhat more productive.
   Ideally, a caribou would be killed, and instructors detail the
many uses for the meat, hide and entrails. The Gwich'in have
survived on caribou for centuries.
   But this January, the nearest caribou were 80 miles away.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The once barren wastes of northern Quebec,
untamed and pristine, have been transformed by the construction of
the largest hydroelectric project on earth. The government of
Quebec Province says only good will result; the natives think
otherwise and are prepared to try to hold back further building.

<TEXT>
   The $62 billion James Bay project is the
largest hydroelectric development on the planet, cutting roads,
building dams, diverting rivers and changing the face of the earth
in an area as big as France.
   For officials of the Hydro Quebec power company, owned by the
government of the Province of Quebec, taming the wild rivers of
this frigid and practically unpopulated sub-Arctic region is the
cleanest, most economic and socially acceptable way of meeting the
province's growing energy needs into the next century.
   For the 10,000 Cree Indians whose ancestors lived in the
northern Quebec forest here for centuries and who make up one of
the earth's last remaining hunter-trapper societies, the
15-year-old project is disrupting nature, poisoning the fish,
ruining traplines and threatening their traditional way of life.
   And for many environmentalists, the development of the James Bay
region is not only destructive to the fauna and flora, it has been
ill-studied, never subject to public review and may not even be
needed.
   ``If they don't let us develop hydroelectric power, that means
nuclear power at a much higher price, both in money and in
insecurity,'' rejoins Andre Mercier, an engineer and Hydro Quebec's
vice president for system planning in Montreal.
   ``To us, this land is sacred,'' said Matthew Coon-Come, grand
chief of the Crees of Quebec. ``It's the only thing we have left.
It is still our main economic base, hunting and fishing. We are
concerned about the kind of land and environment we leave behind
for our children.''
   Radisson is the end of the road north. After Radisson, you go by
air, by water or you walk. From here to the northern tip of Quebec
Province is 650 miles of trackless taiga and tundra. Until now it
has been the domain of the Cree, a few Inuit Indians and the
occasional hardy white hunter or fisherman.
   Seen from Radisson, a company town of about 2,500 inhabitants
650 miles north of Montreal, the James Bay project is an awesome
engineering accomplishment. In just one phase of construction that
began on one river, La Grande, the company has built nine dams and
206 dikes using 150 million hours of work by 55,000 people. It has
excavated 262 million cubic meters of rock and soil and poured
550,000 tons of concrete into pristine northern rivers. And it
spent $13.8 billion.
   One example of the Herculean nature of the scheme: the
Caniapiscau River, which used to run north and empty into Ungava
Bay, now runs west into the La Grande system and empties most of
its water into James Bay.
   The LG2 dam just east of here, on what 10 years ago was a lonely
river in a vast, silent forest of black spruce, is as high as a
53-story building and is 1} miles long. It required 23 million
cubic meters of fill. That, as Hydro Quebec's on-site public
relations officer Serge Marcoux likes to say, ``is 10 times the
volume of the Cheops Pyramid,'' for all those whose mind's eye
carries a portable pyramid.
   When all 16 LG2 turbine units are operating at the same time,
Marcoux says it requires the equivalent of five Olympic swimming
pools full of water each second, for those who think in terms of
Olympic swimming pools. The reservoir contains enough water to
supply the needs of Montreal for a century.
   And that's not counting LG3 and LG4, or LG1 now under
construction downstream, or the new power plant here called LG2A,
or the Laforge 1 and Laforge 2 plants to come on line in 1993 and
1994. It's mind-boggling.
   Phase 1 of La Grande has added 10,282 megawatts of power to
Hydro Quebec's capacity. A megawatt is 1 million watts. Phase 2 is
adding 4,652 megawatts more. Next on Hydro Quebec's horizon is
development of the Great Whale River, 125 miles north, for another
3,500 megawatts, followed by the Nottaway, Broadback and Rupert
Rivers, known as NBR, 8,000 megawatts.
   The Crees are determined to stop Great Whale and NBR development
and have filed actions in both federal and provincial courts.
   ``Right now, we are economically self-sufficient,'' says
Coon-Come. ``But they are going to destroy it. Then the taxpayers
are going to say, `Those lazy Indians, now we have to pay for their
housing, their health services, their alcohol abuse programs.' They
are going to find their taxes going to these `lazy, drunken
Indians.' That's because they destroyed our economic base.''
   Mercier estimated the hydroelectric potential of the James Bay
rivers at 50,000 megawatts, some of them more cost efficient than
others.
   ``There is no other province or state in North America that is
in such a privileged situation,'' he said. ``It is a resource that
is there to use.''
   In that, Mercier is echoing his boss, Quebec Premier Robert
Bourassa, whose policy is to make hydroelectric development of the
province's vast northland the foundation of the entire economic
development of Quebec, whose leaders in the past have raised the
possibility of secession.
   ``Quebec is a vast hydroelectric plant in the bud, and every day
millions of potential kilowatt hours flow downhill and out to sea.
What a waste,'' Bourassa said in his 1985 book ``Power from the
North.''
   Hydro Quebec revenues represent 5 percent of the province's
gross national product with $5.2 billion in sales to Quebec and
$308 million to the rest of Canada and the United States. It is a
company with $34 billion in assets, but also $22 billion in
long-term debt.
   The sale of electricity to the United States particularly riles
opponents. Many feel Quebec is being raped to run the
air-conditioners of New York.
   Hydro sees foreign sales as subsidizing construction now for
meeting future Canadian needs.
   Seen from Chisasibi, a Cree village of 2,500 about 80 miles to
the west on the shore of James Bay, the development is equally
awesome. It brought the 20th century crashing down on a simple
people.
   Before the project, there was no road to Chisasibi. Nobody had
cars or trucks; there was no television and little store-bought
food. Supplies came in summer by barge from northern Ontario.
   Hydro Quebec built the road and the modern world drove right
down it to the James Bay, bringing better education and health
care. But it also brought the dark side of modern life _
alcoholism, drug abuse and juvenile delinquency.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Thursday recovered an estimated $3,000 in 
camera gear and clothing that was reported stolen the previous night from an 
entourage traveling with 11-year-old Tony Aliengena, the San Juan Capistrano 
youth who is flying around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties also announced that they had arrested a local man in connection 
with the break-in and theft at the Frobisher Inn, where Tony and 15 members of 
his entourage are staying. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old man, who cannot be identified until conviction under Canadian 
law, is from nearby Lake Harbor but was arrested in this Arctic Circle village. 
Mounted Constable Jim Cook said the man had checked into a room across from 
where Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, had stowed most of the crew's gear. He was 
taken into custody without incident and will be held without bail pending trial 
on charges of break-in and entry. 
</P>
<P>
Because the man is a convicted criminal on probation for a previous break-in 
and theft, Cook said, he faces a possible prison term of three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group Was Eating 
</P>
<P>
The property taken Wednesday night included camera gear belonging to both Gary 
Aliengena and Alexie Grinevich, a Soviet journalist accompanying the flight, 
Cook said. Some clothing belonging to Tony and his father was also removed from 
a bag, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The break-in occurred while the Aliengena family and their entourage were 
eating dinner. Maxim Chikin, a fellow Soviet correspondent, discovered the 
theft when he returned from dinner to the ransacked room. 
</P>
<P>
"They have taken my stuff," Chikin said. 
</P>
<P>
Chikin and Grinevich later told the authorities that a man staying in a room 
across the hallway had watched them as they unloaded luggage into the room. The 
Soviets, who arrived here in a chase plane about an hour after Tony landed, 
identified the suspect in custody as the person they had seen. 
</P>
<P>
The theft was viewed as a major embarrassment in this wind-swept outpost of 
3,200 inhabitants, most of them native Inuits. To help soften the blow, the 
Mounted Police detachment here Thursday morning delivered a packet of souvenir 
stickers and pins for the entourage. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said the suspect was relatively easy to apprehend because Iqaluit is an 
island community, closed off to the world except for an airport that operates 
commercial flights only by day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Least We Can Do' 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a bunch of people traveling through here on good cause and it's the 
least we can do to try and help them out," Cook said of Tony's friendship 
mission around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's father assured the Canadians that there were no hard feelings. The 
Aliengena family rested in Iqaluit on Thursday, meeting students at the local 
school and taking joy rides around a frozen bay on a Hoverjet. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a ball here," Aliengena said at an Iqaluit press conference Thursday 
night. 
</P>

   A Soviet-American dog sledding team announced
plans Tuesday to symbolically break the ice between Siberian and
Alaskan Eskimos during a 1,200-mile goodwill trek that will include
the first sanctioned crossing of the Bering Strait since 1948.
   Ten men and two women, comprising six Soviets and six Americans,
plan to depart March 1 from Anadyr, Siberia, on a two-month journey
visiting 30 native settlements along an old Arctic trade route.
   The expedition is an attempt to call attention to the common
cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples of the Bering region,
expedition co-leader Paul Schurke, 33, of Minneapolis, said at a
news conference at the Russian Tea Room in Manhattan.
   ``Some of the team members have relatives on the other side,''
Schurke said, so it could be a very emotional experience.
   Because visitors are rare in villages so close to the top of the
world, he predicted that the expedition would be met with
``spontaneous celebrations and jamborees'' and that schools would be
let out so that the children could ski along with the team for a
while.
   A veteran of Arctic travel who made an unassisted trek to the
North Pole in 1986, Schurke said the journey was ``an opportunity to
combine my interest in travel in the north with playing a part in
the process of improving Soviet-American relations.''
   Speaking through an interpreter, Soviet co-leader Dmitry Shparo,
47, of Moscow, praised Du Pont Co., the major American corporate
sponsor of the Bering Bridge Expedition. Shparo also put in a plug
for the main Soviet sponsors, Pravda's youth newspaper, the tourist
bureau known as Sputnik and Novosti, a news agency.
   Although he is a mathematics professor at Moscow's Institute of
Steel and Alloys, Shparo is best known as a writer and adventurer.
In 1979, he won the Soviet Union's highest honor, the Order of
Lenin, for successfully leading a ski expedition to the North Pole.
Last year, he was a member of a Soviet-Canadian trek across the
polar ice cap from the USSR to Canada.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who also attended the news
conference, called the Bering Bridge Expedition ``another step
toward melting the ice curtain.''
   Murkowski noted that the U.S. government is working on a new
treaty with the Soviets that would permit American Eskimos to visit
and trade with their counterparts in Siberia without visas.
   In 1938, the two countries signed an agreement that regularized
travel in the Bering region, but that agreement was abrogated in
1948 during the iciest days of the Cold War.
   In the spirit of adventure diplomacy, the team hopes a new
agreement can be signed at a ceremony at the U.S.-Soviet border
around April 1.

   The outcome of the two-week effort to free
two California gray whales may never be known as the massive mammals
faced 200 miles of ice-clogged waters on the way to their winter
home.
   Indeed, the sentiment among rescuers Friday was that ignorance
would be bliss if the whales died soon after more than $1 million
and countless hours of labor were spent trying to save them.
   ``A lot of people just didn't want to know'' about their fate,
said federal marine mammal biologist Jim Harvey.
   Rescuers decided against affixing radio transmitters to the
animals. That entailed additional expense, and rescue coordinator
Ron Morris said little scientific knowledge could be gained from
tracking a pair of young, lost whales.

   The two whales that captured the world's attention

North,'' Aqqaluk Lynge, of the Greenland office of the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference, said Friday at a news conference that
concluded a three-day meeting on arctic cooperation.
   ``To my mind it's a degradation of human values,'' he said.

   UNDATED _ Anti-abortion protesters planned pickets and blockades
at clinics across the country today after their weekend of
demonstrations kicked off with nearly 200 arrests in four states.
   The New York-based Operation Rescue planned demonstrations in 32
U.S. cities and said as many as 5,000 people could be arrested.
   Today's protests marked a continuation of the anti-abortion
campaign that has resulted in about 7,000 arrests nationwide in the
last five months. The campaign began in July during the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, and more than 1,200 people have been
taken into custody in 20 demonstrations in the Georgia capital since
then.

   The Reagan administration has rejected a rice
industry request for a federal investigation of Japanese barriers to
rice imports, averting a political storm in Japan and threatening
one in the United States.
   The decision announced Friday was something of a surprise and was
the first important test of the new, tougher 1988 Omnibus Trade Act
that was designed to help restore the competitiveness of American
goods on foreign markets.
   Disappointed U.S. rice industry officials condemned the decision
and said in a statement that it hoped the new administration to take
office in January ``will be more concerned about promoting U.S.
interests than pleasing foreign governments ...''
   Clayton Yeutter, the special trade representative, said in
announcing the decision to reject a petition of rice growers and
millers that Japan's virtual ban on imported rice was indefensible
and intolerable. He said it would be vigorously challenged, but not
in the bilateral fashion demanded by U.S. rice farmers.

   ``Taking advantage of the damage, the trauma, the Yankees have
already ordered the infiltration of 3,000 mercenaries into
Nicaraguan territory,'' Ortega said Friday in a nationwide radio and

   In Washington, State Department press officer Anita Stockman
denied the allegations. ``No U.S. military aid is being provided to
the Contras at this time,'' she said, referring to the rebels.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission voted Friday to ban the
game, and commission officials said the restriction could be in
force as early as mid-December.
   The commission also approved safety standards for all-terrain

   The ban on lawn darts does not include a recall of the games

   Economists are disputing the Reagan
administration's contention that the budget deficit's underlying
trend is downward despite a small increase for 1988.
   The Treasury Department and the White House Office of Management
and Budget reported Friday that the imbalance between revenues and
spending rose to $155.1 billion for the budget year that ended Sept.
30, a $5.4 billion increase over 1987.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in a joint statement with
the OMB, pointed out that several one-time events, including the
phase-in of the new tax law, cut the 1987 deficit and inflated the
1988 budget gap.
   Excluding those special factors, the deficit would have fallen
$31.1 billion between 1987 and 1988, he said, adding, ``The
underlying trend in the deficit ... remains downward.''

<HEAD>Study: Milk Of Canadian Eskimo Women Has Highest PCB Level In World</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The milk of nursing Eskimo women in northern
Quebec has a higher level of PCBs than that of women anywhere in the
world, according to a university study published today.
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, have been linked to cancer
and skin rashes.
   The 1987 study at Laval University in Ste-Foy, Quebec, obtained
by the daily Le Devoir newspaper of Montreal, compared 24 samples of
milk from Eskimo women in northern Quebec to that of 48 women from
southern Quebec, some from an industrial suburb of Quebec City and
the rest from Baie-Comeau on the shore of the lower St. Lawrence
near an aluminum smelter.
   The fat in the milk of the Eskimo women showed an average PCB
concentration of 3.59 parts per million compared to 0.76 for the
rest of the samples, the newspaper said. Some Eskimo women had a
concentration of 14.7.
   Health and Welfare Canada, the federal agency responsible for
health regulations, has set a tolerance level of 1.5 parts per
million.
   Eskimo women in northern Quebec tend to breast feed their babies
for up to 23 months. Their diet for centuries has included large
amounts of fish and animal fat.
   Le Devoir quoted the study as saying an Eskimo child nursed by a
mother whose milk has the average amount of PCB contamination would
have imbibed enough of the toxic chemical within a year to show
observable effects such as skin problems, liver complaints and
problems with their immune system.
   Among women whose milk is highly contaminated, such effects might
appear after four or five months, the newspaper said.
   The authors of the study say the PCBs in the area enter the
environment from industrial waste poured into rivers and coastal
waters and could come from as far away as the Soviet Union.
   Eric Dewailly of Laval University's hospital center, who directed
research for the study, was quoted as telling Le Devoir that fish in
the St. Lawrence river ``are more contaminated than those in the
north.
   ``But we southerners eat a lot less fish than the Inuit
(Eskimo),'' he said.
   The Laval scientists plan to monitor the subjects and their
children for the next year, the newspaper said.

<HL> The Prospect of New Oil Development
Again Divides the Natives of Alaska

<TEXT>
   Like the Brooks Range rearing up behind this little Eskimo village on the Beaufort Sea, the prospect of vast new oil development now looms over Alaska's North Slope. 
It is a prospect full of both promise and threat, one that has divided the state's natives before and now divides them again. 

   Many Eskimos and Indians fear oil's potential impact on the environment, on the animals that are their subsistence and on a native way of life already undermined and collapsing. 
But with few exceptions, even those who harbor these fears are swallowing them and throwing in with the oil men. 
There is simply too much money to be made, especially when native corporations all over the state have been faltering and the dividends they paid have been drying up. 

   The oil companies, with the support of the Interior Department, want Congress to let them drill on the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
By some estimates, there is one chance in five that this strip contains major reserves -- perhaps more than a third as much as the colossal nine billion-barrel deposit found 100 miles west at Prudhoe Bay in 1968. 

   Another huge strike here would maintain and accelerate the flow of comforts and luxuries that many natives have grown accustomed to, and make some of them very rich indeed. 
"The sky would be the limit," says Dan Fauske, the director of finance and administration for the North Slope Borough, the government unit that spans northern Alaska. 
A lawyer for one native group says a find would make its members "the Hunt brothers of the 21st century." 

   Some natives' willingness to have more oil development also reflects worry about declining industry investment at Prudhoe. 
The tax revenues of North Slope Borough have fallen by $20 million this year, forcing the borough to cut salaries and construction. 
And the borough figures that half its present tax base will be gone in 12 more years. 
Without more oil development, many fear, the slope will revert to what one native leader calls "a lonely Arctic ghetto." 

   In the Eskimo town of Barrow, Warren Matumeak recalls the hard times of his youth in a tiny makeshift house with seal-blubber heat and seal-oil light. 
Native youngsters had to attend government boarding schools far away. 
He has no longing for the old Barrow. 
"My God," he says, "we love the TV, we love the schools, we love the gym. . . . 
Without development we can't pay for them." 

   Land swaps between the Interior Department and native corporations have broadened support for development by giving more natives a direct stake in it. 
The first swap occurred in 1983 when Arctic Slope Region Inc. exchanged land it held in the Brooks Range for mineral rights on 93,000 acres here at Kaktovik, in the middle of the potentially oil-rich coastal plain. 

   The regional corporation then leased the rights to a group headed by Chevron Corp. for a $25 million bonus. 
Arctic Slope will get $12 million more if Congress opens the plain to drilling and a bonanza from royalties if a big strike is made. 
Since then, at least six other native corporations around the state have taken on oil-company partners and have contracted to swap 891,000 acres of their lands for mineral rights controlled by the Interior Department on 166,000 acres of the plain. 

   These later swaps, however, have been furiously opposed by influential members of Congress, and the Interior Department has at least temporarily shelved plans to submit them to Congress for approval. 
Democratic Rep. George Miller of California calls them a "subterfuge" aimed at forcing the opening of the coastal plain and a "giveaway" of valuable public lands. 
Other foes include environmentalists, who don't want the plain drilled, and the state, which would share income from federal leases but not from native ones. 

   So the natives wait, many of them still ambivalent about more oil but increasingly dependent on it. 
In Kaktovik, a hamlet of 210 souls, money from Prudhoe's development has replaced all the dog sleds with snowmobiles. 
It has built a school with computer classes, a big gym and a swimming pool; modern homes with phones, TV sets and microwave ovens; and a medical clinic. 
And the village corporation, which has 114 shareholders, has received $2.4 million in land-access payments from the Chevron group. 

   But villagers initially opposed development at Prudhoe Bay, and Mayor Loren Ahlers said many argued against the latest developments at "hundreds" of meetings. 
The village "just got burned out" in argument, he adds, and joined forces with big oil only after losing hope that it could be blocked. 

   People in the Indian town of Arctic Village, across the Brooks Range from Kaktovik, have nothing to gain from oil development and still resist it. 
The village subsists on the huge caribou herd that winters over a vast expanse but whose calving grounds lie on the plain near Kaktovik. 
The villagers fear that oil development might decimate the herd or disrupt its migration. 

   "How would the rest of the country like it if we took away all their meat?" demands villager Edward Sam. 
Village chief Lincoln Tritt adds: "To us, this isn't an environmental issue or an energy issue. 
It's an issue of survival."

   The Canadian utility representative spoke of
kilowatts, reservoirs and big savings to taxpayers, but the grand
chief of the Cree Indian tribe saw a giant hydroelectric project in
a different light.
   ``It will be a cultural genocide for us,'' said Cree Grand Chief
Matthew Coon-Come. ``Our main diet is fish. They tell us we cannot
eat the fish.''
   ``America, you are the builder. Wall Street is financing. It's
time the little guy starts speaking up,'' Coon-Come said Thursday
after he and other Indians paddled up in a canoe and climbed onto a
lower Manhattan dock in the shadow of skyscrapers.
   It was the last stop on a 1,300-mile trip from their Quebec
homes.
   Coon-Come and Robert Brunette, a vice president of the
government-owned Hydro-Quebec, differ about how much land the
project would affect. Estimates range as high as several hundred
thousand square miles.
   Most of the power generated would benefit Canada. But up to 10
percent would be exported to various of the United States.
   The project requires reversing the course of three rivers.
   And it means building six more dams along five rivers that flow
into James Bay in northern Quebec.
   The contracts to finance the project and sell the power have
been signed. The only remaining obstacles are approval from
Canada's National Energy Board and an avalanche of bad publicity
brought on by the 10,000 Cree and Inuit Indians who live along the
James Bay.
   Brunette conceded that some species of fish would be made
inedible by mercury contamination.
   ``There is jubilation in my heart and also I cry,'' said
Coon-Come, relieved at completing his journey but predicting
doomsday for his home environment.
   ``Some people call us primitive,'' Coon-Come said. ``We still
hunt and fish as a way of life. We have protected that land.''
   He drew sympathy from Dennis DeLeon, New York City's Human
Rights commissioner, and from city Councilwoman Miriam Friedlander,
who said people ``continue without thinking to destroy fragile
parts of the earth.''
   The New York Power Authority says that buying hydroelectric
power from Quebec since 1978 has saved more than $600 million and
eliminated the need for nearly 6 billion gallons of oil.
   The state would be able to start drawing power from the new
project in 1995, saving about $3 billion over 20 years, said Power
Authority Chairman Richard Flynn.
   He said the project would cause significantly less environmental
damage than the coal-burning plants that would have to be built
otherwise.
   As for the Indians, Flynn said, ``We really think it's an
internal affair for the Canadians.''

FT  09 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greenland refinery proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 300m zinc refinery might be built in Greenland to process some of
the raw material which at present is shipped from the Canadian Arctic to
Europe for refining.
Substantial quantities of zinc concentrate are produced in the Canadian
Arctic and the supply is expected to increase in 1997 with the start-up of
Metall Mining's Isok Lake project in the Northwest Territories.
Greenland's refinery, which would employ about 350 people and be built near
the capital, Nuuk, would use cheap electricity from a hydroelectric facility
which is nearing completion and will be in full production next year.
Mr Robert Gannicott, president of Platinova A/S, the company behind the
scheme, pointed out that Greenland was only half the distance from the
Canadian Arctic compared to Europe - an important consideration when the
Canadian mines had such short shipping seasons.
Nuuk is on Greenland's south-west coast which is kept ice-free all year by
the Gulf Stream. It offers regular, scheduled shipping services to Europe
and North America and considerable excess capacity in ships leaving
Greenland which could accommodate refined metal, Mr Gannicott said.
Platinova - a junior exploration company, quoted in Toronto with mainly
Canadian and European shareholders - has ordered a pre-feasiblity study of
the refinery project from both Sherritt Gordon and Hatch and Associates.
Mr Gannicott was speaking in London during presentations by the Greenland
government designed to encourage mining and oil companies to do more
exploration.
Mr Lars Emil Johansen, premier of Greenland, a country nearly the size of
the US but with a population of only 55,000, was particularly enthusiastic
about a high-grade gold deposit at Nalunaq in the Kirkespir Valley. This was
discovered recently by Nunaoil A/S, a company jointly owned by Greenland and
Denmark, and Mr Johansen said he hoped the find would support a gold mine
which could be producing from 1996-97.
Microdiamonds have also been discovered in west Greenland and RTZ, the
world's biggest mining company, is at present concentrating its exploration
efforts in the country on diamonds.

J'ai quitte mon village
Par le premier bateau
 - Opening lines of a Quebecois rock song.
STAND ON a promontory on the left bank of the St Lawrence. You are just
downstream from the last bridge. Look north, past the rooftops of Quebec
City's old town. The first few miles of countryside in that direction are
cultivated. Beyond, a black forest rises up the slopes of the Laurentian
ridge. On the other side it dips down, out of sight, to another country: a
dimpled plain of wood and water.
Four hundred miles north of Quebec City, the sub-arctic taiga starts and the
moose die of cold. It is another 800 miles to the few Inuit settlements on
the crinkly coastline opposite Baffin Island, where visitors can arrive only
by seaplane or kayak. After that? A desert stretching to Siberia.
Quebec City is at the edge of civilisation. But it thinks it is at its
centre.
Five million French-speaking Quebecois adore their city. Their taxes pay for
a gilt-encrusted parliament building and smart suits for the MPs. Some of
their most talented sons and daughters cannot bear to leave.
To Americans, old Quebec City is cute. Its fortifications, chateau, winding
streets and son et lumieres are picturebook Europe. Wise old-worlders might
more easily see a city hooked on tourist dollars and politicians' expense
accounts. The money has bred self-satisfaction. Add nationalism (and
Catholic guilt?) and you have paranoia: languages other than French are
banned from public notices. Bienvenue, yes. Wilkommen, no.
Out in the countryside, among the 5m, the phenomenon of French North America
is more beguiling. In the farming and fishing towns, adorned with the
belvederes and verandahs of New England-style summerhouses, les anglos seem
far away.
The south shore of the St Lawrence is peppered with mean sounding towns like
Trois Pistoles and Riviere du Loup. They are actually sweet little
agricultural and tourism centres. The loup in Riviere du Loup is not a wolf,
but a fish.
The Auberge Mange Grenouille is a converted village general store by a small
nature reserve in the village of Bic. Its sloping floorboards were as shiny
and new as a Madonna hit record and the chambre nuptiale came complete with
brass bedstead and purple drapes. 'C'est un peu fou, je sais,' shrugged
Madame, a warm round woman with an all-embracing personality that seems both
American and French.
The chambre had no en suite bathroom. A creaking hallway, lined with
wood-framed vignettes of small animals curled up in pools of sand-coloured
light, leds to the loo. The awkward Victorian door knobs conspired to
frustrate any urgency in a stumbling dawn patrol, but the auberge's giant
electronically-controlled whirlpool bath was as seductive as plumbing can
ever be.
The Mange Grenouille is on the south shore of the St Lawrence. The American
shore. Part of a civilised, settled, comfortable continent. The landscape is
farmland. The US is a few miles away, through a panhandle of Nouveau
Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province.
Sept Iles is on the north shore, where the climate is like Mont Blanc's. It
is the last town on the road going east. The frontier.
No one speaks English. Why should they? None of their ancestors spoke
English. Nor do relatives, neighbours or visitors. Les Anglos are further
away than the Shetlands are from Paris. The welcome is warm, if a little
surprised.
There is one maple leaf, on a flag outside the town's hospital. Everywhere
else the fleur de lys flutters: from apartment blocks, schools and the
dozens of video rental hypermarkets.
Fifteen feet of snow fall each year in Sept Iles, by the salt water of the
St Lawrence estuary. In late May, just before the blue whales arrive, the
air still freezes at night. The tourist kayaks stand idle, waiting for the
last ice on the lakes to break up. Renting videos is still big business.
There is a railhead at Sept Iles. The single track line goes north, inland.
It leads to a settlement called Fermont, whose literal translation,
Ironmountain, describes one of the land's natural riches. Like Quebec City,
Fermont has fortifications; unlike Quebec City, the defensive wall was built
before the houses. It keeps the wind out.
I missed the train to Fermont by eight hours. The next one was six days
later. Maybe I was lucky.
Daniel Green was a guest of the tourist offices of the provinces of Quebec
and Ontario. He travelled with Air Canada (London tel: 081-759 2636) to
Montreal.
Return fares range from Pounds 258 and Pounds 368, for east and west coasts
respectively, to Pounds 3,288 and Pounds 4,126.

<TEXT>
   Greenland Premier Jonathan Motzfeldt
has called for March elections following a scandal arising from
allegations that Cabinet ministers misused public funds, news
reports said Monday.
   Opponents of Motzfeldt's socialist government claim to have
documents to show that government members, including the premier,
spent state money on lavish meals for the party faithful, the
Greenland newspaper Atuagagdliutit said.
   Motzfeldt, a pastor of the Greenland Lutheran Church, has held
the premiership since Greenland won partial independence from
Denmark in 1979.
   About 53,000 people reside in Greenland, which has 840,000
square miles of territory, about 80 percent of it ice-covered.
   Motzfeldt allegedly used $9,000 of taxpayers' money on a
luxurious dinner in support of his own re-election as party leader,
the paper said.
   Bowing to opposition demands that his administration resign,
Motzfeldt set the vote for March 5.
   In the last ballot, in May 1987, Motzfeldt's Siumut Party and
the non-socialist opposition Atassut Party each won 11 mandates in
the 16-seat Landsting, or homerule parliament.
   Siumut formed a coalition with the leftist Inuit Ataqatigiit
party, which has one mandate.
   The conservative-leaning Issittup Party has four.
