   Former Democratic vice presidential nominee
Geraldine Ferraro says both Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican
George Bush did well in Sunday night's debate, but Bush's success
came ``probably because I taught him how to do it.''
   Ms. Ferraro, who debated Bush during the 1984 campaign, also
said her unsuccessful campaign would continue to be significant
until a woman is elected to the White House.
   ``I have a place in history,'' she said Monday night before a
speech at Emory University. ``And I'll have that place in history
until a woman runs and wins. Then I'll fade into the woodwork.''
   Ms. Ferraro, a former New York congresswoman, was the running
mate chosen by Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale,
making her the only woman ever nominated for president or vice
president by a major political party.
   The 1984 Democratic ticket suffered one of the worst defeats
ever in a presidential race.

   The Oct. 5 starting times for the
vice-presidential debate and the major league baseball playoffs
have been juggled to avoid a conflict, officials involved said.
   The 90-minute debate between Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and
Republican Dan Quayle was moved from a 9 p.m. EDT starting time to
8:30 p.m., officials said Tuesday.
   The start of the first game of the American League playoffs,
scheduled for the home of the East Division winner, was moved from
8:28 p.m. to 1:20 p.m., and the first pitch of game two in the
National League playoffs at Los Angeles was pushed back from 3:07
p.m. to 10:08 p.m.
   ABC will televise the baseball games. All the major networks

<HEAD>Heavy Metal Adds Heavy Cost To VP Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor's office has added $200,000 to the
city's potential tab for hosting the Oct. 5 vice presidential
debate, bringing the estimated cost to $900,000.
   The cost includes about $43,000 the city will pay to buy out a
heavy metal rock concert by the ``Scorpions'' that had been
scheduled for the City Auditorium, mayoral aide Kevin Collison said
Tuesday.
   The cost of staging the debate between Sens. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, and Dan Quayle, R-Ind., increased largely because the city
was forced to switch the debate site from the Orpheum Theater to
the City Auditorium, Collison said.
   The auditorium was the second choice of city officials who said
they could not afford the $200,000 needed to buy out three shows of
the musical ``Cats'' that were scheduled over two days at the
Orpheum.
   Collison said other costs _ including new chairs and a new
lighting system _ have driven the price tag for the auditorium
higher than had been forecast.

<TEXT>
   Antonetta Ferraro, mother of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, has died. She was 84.
   Mrs. Ferraro died Friday at her daughter's Forest Hills home of
emphysema and cancer.
   ``I always said I had two role models in life,'' Ms. Ferraro
told New York Newsday. ``One was Eleanor Roosevelt and one was
Antonetta Ferraro. She worked all her life. She worked in
sweatshops when they were really sweatshops. She learned a trade at
13 that put me through law school.''
   Mrs. Ferraro, whose husband, Dominick, died in 1943, had left
the hospital two months ago to be with her daughter and her family.
   The family has set up the Antonetta Ferraro Scholarship Fund at
Marymount Manhattan College in Manhattan, where Ms. Ferraro
graduated.
   ``It's a scholarship fund for girls who have been raised
(solely) by their mothers,'' said Ms. Ferraro, the Democrat nominee
for vice-president in 1984. ``My mother felt she never had an
education, but I always told her she did pretty well by me.''
   In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Ferraro is survived by a son,
Carl, and six grandchildren.
   The funeral was set for Tuesday in the New York City borough of
Queens.

<DESCRIPT>  LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  As a woman and a journalist, I was offended by the Los Angeles Times story
"Ferraro in the running again," in the Nov. 20 Mercury News.;   Why did Josh
Getlin feel it pertinent to his story to include evidence of Ferraro's
appearance in his lead? Why do I need to know that her face is "more deeply
lined" or that her hair, once "frosted blond," has now "gone gray"?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  The Letters Page  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  GERALDINE FERRARO LOOKS QUALIFIED BY ANY MEASURE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Letters Page  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     This is classic evidence of the societal prejudice against older women, if
not women in general. Appearance over substance. Aging men are
"distinguished," while older women get "dumpy" or "matronly.";   Our
male-dominated society has it all figured out: Men always improve -- they get
wiser; women always decay, losing their appearances and thus their value.;  
Ferraro deserves better, especially in light of the fact she fights these
stereotypes for a living and furthered the women's movement immeasurably when
she became the first woman vice presidential candidate in 1984.;   Now she is
striving to wrest the power from the sexist legislators who apparently feel
comfortable allowing a lying, sexual vigilante to sit on the highest court in
America.;   Getlin should have recognized that Ferraro's substance is all that
matters and besides, she still looks damn good to me.;   But then, if we use
his logic, maybe Getlin is just too adorable (i.e., lacks the gray matter) to
get the big picture.;   -- Brooke Shelby Biggs;   Executive Editor;   Spartan
Daily, SJSU; Josh Getlin's characterization of Geraldine Ferraro is another
example of media sexism.;   Why is it that a woman's appearance always
requires comment. I don't see journalists describing male political candidates
as having "blond hair gone gray" and having "more deeply lined" faces. I would
think that journalists today would have greater professionalism.;   --
Margaret Flores;   San Jose; Josh Golin states that "On a hot summer night
seven years ago, Ferraro became the first woman in history to be nominated for
the vice presidency.";   That statement is not correct. Not only was Ferraro
not the first woman to run for the vice presidency, she wasn't even the third
or fourth. Many third parties have nominated women for vice president and
president. Nor was she the first woman to receive an electoral college vote.
That piece of history belongs to Tonia Nathan. She received an electoral
college vote in 1972. She ran on the Libertarian Party ticket.;   If you're
interested in new ideas, such as running a woman for president or vice
president, you can be sure America's third parties will be the first to try
it. Next year if you want to vote for a woman for the vice presidential spot,
one option will be Dr. Nancy Lord, the Libertarian Party's nominee. I doubt
you'll have that option on the Demo-Republican ticket.;   -- Mark Hinkle;

<LEADPARA>  THE FROSTED blond hair has gone to gray, her face is more deeply lined and
there's a subtle barrier, a distance, between Geraldine Ferraro and the
well-wishers who crowd around her these days.;   But when it comes to letting
the old boys have it, especially the Republicans who tormented Ferraro during
her 1984 run for the vice presidency, the homemaker from Queens who made
history is remarkably unchanged.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  FERRARO IN THE RUNNING AGAIN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Lemme tell ya, there's a vicious rumor about me going around," she tells a
group of business and professional women on a blustery morning. "They say I
have my eyes on Sen. Al D'Amato's seat.";   Pause.;   "I don't have my eyes on
his seat. It's his job that I want.";   The cheering crowd in a hotel banquet
room rises to its feet, and Ferraro is rolling once again. A hero and role
model to many women present, she's attempting a political comeback from the
ashes of her disastrous national campaign. And nobody is counting her out.;  
On a hot summer night seven years ago, Ferraro became the first woman in
history to be nominated for the vice presidency. Based largely on that
memorable event, she continues to enjoy a political celebrity few can match.
Although the New York Senate election is almost a year away, her battle to
unseat D'Amato, a two-term GOP incumbent, is drawing enthusiastic crowds.;  
So far, however, Ferraro has been preaching to the choir. The people begging
for autographs these days don't seem too concerned about questions of ethical
impropriety that dogged her vice presidential campaign, even though they are
likely to be raised in 1992. She has yet to face an ugly crowd -- the kind
that derided her support for abortion rights and insulted members of her
family.;   Those scars have not yet healed, and the 1991 Ferraro is a warier
political creature. She is less trusting of the press this time around and can
be impatient with slow questioners at political events. Determined to protect
her privacy, she has nonetheless put herself under the microscope again.;   
AT SOME point, Ferraro agrees, she will have to face the past: old questions
about her husband's real estate deals, whispered allegations of his mob ties,
her son's conviction for attempted sale of cocaine and charges that she
mishandled her finances as a three-term congresswoman. But for now, there is
no mistaking the excitement and feeling of rebirth surrounding her senatorial
race, especially when she speaks to women's groups.;   "I was thinking about
the unemployment bill that President Bush vetoed (this summer)," Ferraro told
the Syracuse crowd. "And then I realized, he probably thinks that if Clarence
Thomas can get a job, anybody can get a job.";   The audience applauds,
cheering her digs at the all-white, all-male Senate Judiciary Committee that
debated Thomas' nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court. But the biggest
applause comes for a line she uses in every speech.;   "Women in this country
have a feeling they've been had," she said. "And I'll be damned if I'm going
to let the '90s go down as the decade in which the Soviets won their rights
and American women lost theirs.";   "You have to understand, this woman
changed my life," said Virginia Hundt, a businesswoman who is running for a
local office next year and who has been waiting 30 minutes to have her picture
taken with Ferraro.;   "She showed women that they could make a difference on
the national political level, and she's a tremendous inspiration to us all."; 
 Others are more skeptical. Across the room, Mary Carswell, a deputy airport
manager, agrees that Ferraro is a historic figure and not just another
political big shot. Still, Carswell wonders why the candidate would again put
herself through the torture of public examination: "I wouldn't change places
with her for the world. Who needs the punishment? Why do it again?";   Indeed,
some critics dismiss Ferraro's campaign as an exercise in nostalgia,
predicting that she cannot win a hotly contested Democratic primary next year
against three other candidates. The formidable field includes New York
Attorney General Robert Abrams, New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holzman
and Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y.;   But a recent Buffalo News poll had good news
for Ferraro. Taken after the Thomas hearings, it showed her leading Abrams 40
percent to 38 percent, with Holzman and Mrazek far behind.;    YET EVEN if she
wins the primary, critics say, D'Amato could make mincemeat of her. They
believe Ferraro, weighted by her own baggage, is the only Democratic candidate
who could not credibly attack D'Amato for political corruption.;   The senator
has been stung by charges of malfeasance over the allocation of federal
housing funds in his district and is plummeting in the polls. Although he was
exonerated by the Senate ethics committee, D'Amato is believed vulnerable in
1992, especially to a squeaky-clean candidate.;   "The point is, Ferraro's
vulnerable too," said a veteran Republican campaign consultant who asked not
to be identified. "Voters will remember her problems, and if they don't
remember, they'll certainly be reminded.";   If she is bothered by the
conventional wisdom, however, Ferraro doesn't show it. Do the fellas want to
play rough? She'll play rough.;   "I won't let anyone get away with attacking
me," she said, settling in for a long drive from Syracuse to her next
political event, in Albany, N.Y. "If somebody hits me, my response (in a TV
spot) will be in the can. I don't run away from a fight. I'm a fighter."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Ferraro Says Women's Equality Depends On More Female Officeholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geraldine Ferraro, whose vice presidential
nomination marked a peak for the women's equality movement, said
Friday that women must translate their increasing power at the
ballot box to campaigns for elective office.
   ``If you don't run, you can't win,'' Ms. Ferraro said. ``And
just as important, every time a woman runs, women win.''
   Ms. Ferraro addressed some 1,500 women attending a symposium on
women and the Constitution convened by former first ladies Rosalynn
Carter and Lady Bird Johnson.
   She said there are more female officeholders than ever, but the
numbers are not representative of the population.
   ``Women are, by any measure, grossly underrepresented in
elective office,'' Ms. Ferraro said. ``I would say shockingly
underrepresented; however, nobody is shocked. That's simply how it
is.''
   Coretta Scott King, wife of slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., echoed Ms. Ferraro in urging women, particularly
black women, to seek office.
   ``We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for nurturing and
compassion which has been finely honed and tempered in our struggle
to raise families in a sexist society,'' Mrs. King said on the
closing day of the two-day symposium.
   ``Let me put it this way _ if the women of America don't lead
the struggle against poverty, racism and militarism, then we must
ask, who will?'' she said.
   According to the National Women's Political Caucus, in 1987
women held 14 percent of the higher statewide elective offices in
the country. At the same time, there are only 23 women serving in
the House _ and only one black woman _ two female governors and two
women in the Senate.
   Ms. Ferraro, a former congresswoman from New York, said many of
those officeholders are not yet in positions of national power or
leadership, which she said would likely delay nomination of a woman
as a presidential candidate.
   However, more women will become interested in politics and the
numbers elected will increase, she said. Ms. Ferraro said her 1984
campaign with Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale
inspired thousands of women to write her and describe how the
candidacy inspired them to go to law school, medical school, or run
for office.
   ``Every time a woman runs for any elective office, it's like
throwing a stone in a lake,'' she said. ``The ripple effect is felt
far beyond the immediate point of impact.''
   Mrs. King compared the challenge facing women in the workplace
and in politics to that faced by blacks during the civil rights
struggle led by her late husband. She said women can learn much
from the tactics used by blacks to gain rights.
   ``The movement showed millions of Americans that you can, indeed
you must, defy authority when that authority is in the wrong,''
Mrs. King said.
   Women have become a distinct and powerful voting group in recent
years, Ms. Ferraro said, pointing to the 1986 mid-term elections
that brought a Democratic majority to the Senate. She said nine
Democrats won by getting less than 50 percent of the male vote, and
more than 50 percent of the female vote.
   ``Women voted more strongly Democratic, and on key issues like
peace, disarmament, social welfare and the environment, differently
from men,'' she said.
   Ms. Ferraro said that after she was nominated for vice president
during the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco,
the thousands of joyfully weeping women she saw told her that
equality, and a female president, are coming.
   ``She will have shown that she possesses the rare combination of
qualities the American people look for in a president, and then it
will be time. And tears will be cried like you wouldn't believe,''
she said.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's an Expert on Running Against Women; Ferraro
Disagrees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday that he's an
expert when it comes to running a political campaign against women,
but at least one female politician took exception to the contention.
   ``I don't know how he'd call himself an expert,'' former Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro said from New York. ``Only in politics does one
little meeting an expert make.''
   Ferraro was Walter Mondale's vice presidential running mate in
the 1984 race against incumbent President Reagan and Vice President
Bush.
   Bush's comments at a news conference were prompted by a question
about the Texas gubernatorial race that may pit Democrat Ann
Richards against Republican Clayton Williams.
   Williams has said he would feel less comfortable running against
Richards than Attorney General Jim Mattox. Richards, the state
treasurer, and Mattox will battle for the Democratic nomination in
an April 10 run-off election.
   Bush said he had some opinions about running against women,
calling himself ``an expert in the field'' because of his contest
against Ferraro.
   But Ferraro said Bush's memory of the race is flawed, and that
the only time they went head-to-head was in one televised debate.
   ``We did not run against each other. It was Fritz Mondale and
Ronald Reagan who were running against each other,'' Ferraro said.
``If we were both running against each other, if we were both at
the top of the ticket, then I think his comment about being an
expert would be valid.''
   Bush was asked if he had any advice for Williams.
   ``I have none at all, but I know exactly what he means and I
refuse to elaborate on it,'' Bush said.
   Ferraro, meanwhile, said Richards didn't need any advice from
her.
   ``Ann has run against men before. I'm sure she's not
uncomfortable with it,'' Ferraro said, suggesting Williams' problem
may be a common male ailment.
   ``The only way I can see it, being uncomfortable, is when you
lose to a man it's humiliating enough,'' she said. ``But if you're
a macho guy and you lose to a woman, it has to be devastating.''

   The 80-year-old mother-in-law of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro was mugged by a man who
snatched her purse and pushed her to the ground, police said.
   Rose Zaccaro was treated for a cut lip and a bruised cheek and
forehead after the attack, which occurred Sunday afternoon near her
home in Queens. She was released from St. John's Hospital after
X-rays showed no broken bones.
   Police said Mrs. Zaccaro's assailant snuck up from behind as she
was walking. Detectives reported no suspects in the attack.
   Mrs. Zaccaro is the mother of Ms. Ferraro's husband, John
Zaccaro.

<HEAD>Experts Say Top of Ticket, Not Running Mates, Sways Voters' Choice</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrats who hope Sen. Lloyd Bentsen will
help the ticket win his home state of Texas and perhaps the
presidential election could do well to regard the fate of Henry
Gassaway Davis.
   In case anyone doesn't remember, Davis was Democrat Alton B.
Parker's running mate when Parker ran for president against
Republican Teddy Roosevelt in 1904.
   The voters chose between Roosevelt and Parker, and their choice
was Roosevelt by a 3-2 margin.
   Experts concede that the vice presidential debate in Omaha,
Neb., on Wednesday between Bentsen and Republican Dan Quayle may
make a difference, but they say the voters' final decision will
come down to a choice between the top of the tickets, Democrat
Michael Dukakis and Vice President George Bush.
   ``Unless Quayle is absolutely destroyed in the debate with
Bentsen, I don't think it will hurt Bush,'' said Leo Ribuffo, a
specialist in political history at George Washington University in
Washington.
   ``People will be looking for Quayle to blow it,'' said Samuel H.
Kernell, professor of political science at the University of
California at San Diego. ``If he can get through the debate in a
competent fashion where he looks unexceptional, it will be a real
success for him.''
   Eddie Mahe Jr., a Republican political consultant, said, ``I
think it is reasonable to suggest that George Bush would have won
Indiana (Quayle's home state) without Mr. Quayle, and with Mr.
Bentsen, Mike Dukakis is still not going to carry Texas. So you
wash that out.''
   ``I think the odds are that Quayle will have little or no effect
on the ultimate choice,'' said Thomas Mann, program director for
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution here.
   Elspeth Rostow, a political scholar at the Lyndon B. Johnson
School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas in Austin, said
Bush's choice of Quayle ``doesn't seem to have too much effect on
the voters, at least so far.''
   ``I don't think, if indeed Bush was disposed to choose Quayle to
appeal to women, that so far it has had that effect,'' Ms. Rostow
said.
   ``I think the conventional wisdom that the selection of a
running mate is rarely decisive one way or another is absolutely
true,'' said Ribuffo.
   A survey conducted this year by the Hearst Corp. supports this
view.
   Eighteen percent of the 1,001 voters surveyed said they had
changed their minds about a presidential candidate at one time or
another because of their opinion of his running mate. Of those, 70
percent said they voted against that ticket.
   Political experts agree that if a running mate has any effect,
he is more likely to hurt than help.
   Examples cited include President Ford's selection of Sen. Robert
Dole of Kansas, who was criticized for his slashing debating style
in 1976, and Walter Mondale's choice of Geraldine Ferraro, who
suffered from examination of her family's finances in 1984.
   ``Clearly in my opinion Bob Dole in 1976 in that debate (with
Mondale, Jimmy Carter's running mate) cost Jerry Ford votes,'' Mahe
said. ``Clearly in 1984 in my opinion, Geraldine Ferraro cost
Walter Mondale votes probably.''
   In Richard Nixon's unsuccessful campaign of 1960, some thought
that Republican vice presidential candidate Henry Cabot Lodge hurt
the ticket's chances by pledging that Nixon would appoint a black
to the Cabinet _ a statement Nixon disavowed.
   Lodge, a former ambassador to the United Nations, also was
criticized for taking naps and not campaigning hard enough. ``Some
have thought that if he had used his prestige from the U.N. more
effectively, Nixon might have edged out Kennedy,'' Ms. Rostow said.
   There are exceptions to the rule that running mates don't help
much, the experts said.
   While there is disagreement over whether Lodge hurt Nixon in
1960, almost everybody agrees that Lyndon B. Johnson helped Kennedy
by enabling him to carry Texas.
   ``I don't think Kennedy would have won without Johnson,''
Ribuffo said.
   Also, Ribuffo said, Mondale may have helped Carter win election
in 1976 by imparting legitimacy to the former Georgia governor in
the eyes of skeptical liberals.
   Then there was the running mate that Republicans chose in 1900
to help the colorless William McKinley win a second term against
the dynamic Democrat, William Jennings Bryan. The ticket of
McKinley and Roosevelt became known as ``the kangaroo ticket
because it had a kick in the tail,'' Ms. Rostow said.
   There haven't been many tickets in any other year, including
1988, with that much of a kick in the tail, the experts agree.

<HEAD>Reagan on Woman President: `I Welcome It.'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Monday the United States
inevitably will have a woman president, and ``I welcome it.''
   But during a question-and-answer session with a group of school
children in the State Dining Room of the White House, Reagan also
said he thought a woman would likely get to the Oval Office only by
serving first as vice president.
   Asked whether there would ever be a woman chief executive, he
replied, ``I don't know. Believe, I'm certainly not against it. ...''
   ``As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have
met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of England,
Margaret Thatcher, and she's done a remarkable job for England,''
the president said.
   Reagan will play host to Mrs. Thatcher for an official visit and
state dinner at the White House later this week. The British prime
minister has been his closest friend and ally in the Western
Alliance during his nearly eight years in office.
   As for a women president, Reagan said the idea would take ``a
little getting used to on the part of some people. But I think it's
inevitable that in this country there will be a woman president
because they've come up in so many different fields.''
   He added: ``It's just my feeling that probably, rather than one
of them just entering the fray to run for president to begin with,
that maybe it would probably start with one of them, as we did in
the election in 1984, ... running for vice president. She didn't
make it, but that might be the start of it, and I welcome it.''
   Reagan was referring to then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., who
had the second spot on the Democratic ticket headed by then-Vice
President Walter F. Mondale.
   Reagan swept to a 49-state landslide over the ticket, with the
Mondale-Ferraro team carrying only Mondale's home state of Minnesota
and the District of Columbia.
   Reagan's appearance before students from five Washington-area
junior and senior high schools was the first of four such talks the
president plans to give before leaving office on Jan. 20.
   Before taking questions from the pupils, Reagan told his audience
that he would look to young people to carry forth the message of the
American revolution to the rest of the world. But as the world goes
through rapid technological and social change, he said, ``the
permanent truths which give meaning to our lives don't change.''

   A potential juror in the cocaine trial of
John Zaccaro Jr. said she thought the press picked on his family
during the 1984 vice presidential candidacy of his mother,
Geraldine Ferraro.
   The woman was one of 15 candidates selected after painstaking
questioning of 25 people during jury selection, which resumed this
morning for a third day.
   Opening arguments were expected later today or Thursday. Twelve
jurors and two alternates are needed for the trial.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said the selection of
a jury was slowed by the publicity given the case and the fact
Ferraro is so well-known.
   ``Selecting a jury is probably the most important part of the
case,'' he said. Quinn said if even one juror bore a grudge, it
could influence the jury's verdict.
   Most of those questioned said they had read newspaper accounts
of the case since Zaccaro, 24, was charged in 1986 with selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent.
   One potential juror said today that he would discount anything
he read in the newspapers though because of a basic distrust of the
press. ``They have a tendency to present people as guilty just
because they have been charged,'' said Donald Cioffi.
   Only one person has been dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of Zaccaro's mother could affect his view of the case.
   Jury pool member Joanne Cillo said Tuesday that she felt that
press treatment of Ferraro during the 1984 campaign carried over to
Zaccaro.
   ``I can't say I don't feel the press picked on these people,''
Cillo said when asked if she was pleased with how Ferraro has been
treated.
   She said her views would not interfere with her judgment if she
is chosen to hear the case. ``The press is not trying this case,''
she said. ``The issue is, did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   ``I don't believe it's up to me to make restitution for what the
press may or may not have done,'' she added.
   Zaccaro, then a senior at Middlebury College, pleaded innocent
to the charge. He has been accompanied to court each day by his
mother and father, John Zaccaro Sr.
   Ferraro, a lawyer, sat behind her son and his lawyers, taking
notes intently, but stopping when Cillo spoke about her family. At
that point she rested her head in her hand and looked down.
   She later declined to comment on the case, telling one reporter,
``It's nothing against you personally. We're just not answering
anything for anybody.''
   The start of Monday's trial came two years after her son was
arrested outside the Middlebury restaurant where he worked.
   Six reporters were allowed to watch the questioning, which was
briefly interrupted Monday when Judge Francis McCaffrey imposed and
then lifted a gag order on reporters covering jury selection.
   Defense lawyers sought the gag order for fear too many reporters
could intimidate potential jurors. But McCaffrey lifted it
following a challenge from reporters and an agreement to limit
their number in the courtroom.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the courts. Zaccaro's
attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and claimed
unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution because
of his mother.
   The Vermont Supreme Court refused to dismiss the case.

<HEAD>Ferraro Considering Political Comeback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to win a
slot on a major party's presidential ticket, says she's considering
a political comeback.
   Ferraro, Walter Mondale's running mate on the 1984 Democratic
ticket, is weighing a challenge to New York Republican Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato.
   The former three-term congresswoman says she isn't worried that
a political campaign would resurrect hurtful stories about her or
her family.
   ``I don't think there's very much that the people of this state
or this nation don't know about me or about my family,'' Ferraro
said Wednesday in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ferraro was hounded by questions about her family's finances
during the 1984 campaign. She later complained that her political
fame hurt her family and led to harsher court treatment of her
husband and son.
   Her husband, John Zaccaro, pleaded guilty in 1985 to a
misdemeanor charge in a real estate deal. Her son, John Zaccaro
Jr., later was convicted of selling a quarter-gram of cocaine while
at Middlebury College in Vermont.
   ``I would love to back in Washington, I would love to be part of
the decision-making process with reference to what's going on in
this country,'' said Ferraro, 54, who lives in the New York City
borough of Queens.
   A race against Rep. Thomas Manton, who holds Ferraro's former
seat, is out of the question, she said.
   ``I endorsed him and he is a Democrat who represents my district
very, very well.''
   D'Amato's second term ends in 1992. Recent polls show his
popularity is slipping, primarily because of reports that he used
his influence to steer money from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development to friends nd political supporters.
   The Senate ethics committee has hired an outside counsel to
decide whether it should launch a full-scale investigation of
D'Amato.
   Ferraro flirted with the idea of taking on D'Amato in 1986, but
pulled back, citing personal reasons.
   Wednesday, Ferraro said she ruled out that Senate race because
she feared the power of Attorney General Edwin Meese III. The
Justice Department was investigating complaints that she had failed
to fully disclose her husband's finances while she was in Congress.
   ``That investigation continued well past the campaign, nursed by
people within the Justice Department, and I found out later that Ed
Meese had personal interest in it and was tying it to my political
decisions,'' she said.
   ``I did not doubt for one minute that he would use it
politically against me.''
   The 22-month investigation ended with the department deciding
there was no basis for a criminal or civil action.

<HEAD>NOW to Call for Jackson or `Non-White' Woman as Democratic No. 2</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Organization for Women plans
to urge likely Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis to select rival
Jesse Jackson or a ``non-white'' woman as his running mate, the
group's president said Tuesday.
   Molly Yard said it would take the selection of Jackson, who is
very sensitive to women's issues, or ``a woman from Jackson's
constituency'' to smooth relations between the women's movement and
the Democratic Party.
   ``The whole stance of the party since 1984 has been to blame us
for the defeat of Mondale and Ferraro,'' she said.
   NOW, the nation's largest women's rights organization, has been
a major influence in Democratic politics and was a factor in the
selection of Geraldine Ferraro as Walter Mondale's running mate in
the 1984 presidential race. The ticket later was defeated by the
largest margin in the history of U.S. presidential races.
   Ms. Yard said the group plans to introduce a resolution calling
on Dukakis to heed their advice on the vice presidential choice.
The NOW president did not provide a date for the resolution, but
the group is holding its national conference in Buffalo this week.
   Dukakis is currently considering potential running mates.
Jackson, runner-up to the Massachusetts governor in the delegate
race, has said he has earned the right to be offered the No. 2
spot, but Dukakis has not made any commitment.
   Yard also charged that Democratic leaders have tried to keep NOW
out of the 1988 election.
   ``They say they don't want the party captive to special
interests,'' she said. ``I don't know how they can call the
nation's largest group of voters a special interest.''
   There are 10 million more women registered to vote than men, she
said.
   The NOW president also said the Democratic Party could lose the
women's vote and the 1988 presidential election if it doesn't pay
more attention to women's issues.
   Yard warned that millions of women would vote Republican if the
GOP is perceived as caring more than the Democrats about women.
   ``Even though their platform is a disaster, they'll get votes
because they're seriously considering a woman as a vice
presidential candidate,'' Yard said of the Republicans.
   ``Everything depends on who you showcase at the convention,''
she said.
   Elizabeth Dole, the former transportation secretary, is
considered a candidate for the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket that
will be headed by all-but-certain nominee George Bush.
   Selection of Mrs. Dole as a running mate could hand Bush the
presidency, Yard said. Mrs. Dole is the wife of Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole who battled Bush unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential
nomination.
   NOW calculates that Dukakis's apparent early lead over Bush
could disappear if he loses a significant portion of the women's
vote. National polls indicate Bush is running significantly behind
Dukakis among women while running about even among men.
   ``It's not the time for the Democrats to send signals that they
will in any way deny the importance of women's issues,'' she said.

   Geraldine Ferraro, who four years ago became
the first woman on a major party's national ticket, said today she
was ``delighted'' with Michael Dukakis' plans to name Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen as his Democratic running mate.
   She said that had there been enough women in political office to
provide Dukakis with a good choice for a female running mate she
would have been disappointed at his choice of a man.
   ``But because we don't have a woman in that spot, I am not
(disappointed),'' she said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ms. Ferraro, part of the losing Democratic ticket with Walter
Mondale in 1984, said Bentsen ``has been fine on issues that I and
many women care about and in addition to that he's going to be a
very strong help to the ticket, rounding it out beautifully so that
with a Democrat in the White House it's going to make a difference
for the women in this country.''
   ``I'm delighted. I think it's an indication that Governor
Dukakis intends to run a strong national campaign. I think he's
going to go down South and seriously battle the Republicans for
those votes that should be ours based upon the conditions facing
this country,'' she said.
   Earlier, Ms. Ferraro told USA Today that there were not enough
women in positions from which national offices are traditionally
chosen _ the U.S. Senate, Congress and statehouses _ to provide
Dukakis with a good choice. She said no women currently in elected
office meet Dukakis' need of a candidate strong on foreign policy
experience who will also give him geographic balance.
   She said Jesse Jackson ``does not have those credentials that,
politically, Michael Dukakis needs in his vice president.''
   ``Had I not been a woman _ and I'm the first one to say it _ I
probably would not have been chosen,'' she told the newspaper. ``In
1984 ... it was time to remove this final barrier from women's
achieving political power.''
   She said her candidacy in 1984 and Jackson's campaigns are
expanding participation in the political process.
   ``Between Jackson's campaign this year and 1984, we as a nation
said, `Enough already, we're going to let everybody have a chance
to participate.' That's a big thing nobody can take away,'' she
said.
   Ms. Ferraro, 52, said she also has no bitterness over a national
profile that brought harsh scrutiny of her family and criminal
investigations of her husband. Her son was convicted of a drug
charge this year.
   ``1984 was an incredible opportunity for me. That doesn't lead
one to be bitter. I genuinely feel my husband and son were singled
out. That doesn't make us bitter,'' she said. ``I'm not going to
let that happen to me.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo was nominated Monday to run
for a third term, but some at the state Democratic convention
wondered if he'd serve out the term if re-elected or take a run at
the White House.
   With the convention band breaking into ``I Love New York,'' the
57-year-old governor was nominated by acclamation.
   Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 Democratic presidential
candidate was scheduled to address the delegates Tuesday.
   Last week, New York Republicans chose Manhattan economist and
businessman Pierre Rinfret, a political unknown, to challenge Cuomo.
   Making appearances at the convention were New York Mayor David
Dinkins, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro, who spoke out for abortion rights.
   The former Queens congresswoman who ran on the 1984 Democratic
presidential ticket with Walter Mondale is considering a 1992 run
for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Alfonse
D'Amato.
   Another speaker was actor Christopher Reeve, who pressed for
greater efforts to clean up the environment.
   Most speakers stressed the party's goal of claiming majority
control of the Republican-dominated state Senate.
   Delegates nominated Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine to run again with
Cuomo. If re-elected, it would be Lundine's second term as
lieutenant governor.
   The governor, refusing to rule out a possible bid for the
presidency in 1992, announced his re-election plans Sunday. He
considered a presidential campaign in 1988, but ultimately bowed out.
   Ms. Ferraro said Democrats nationwide favor Cuomo.
   ``They believe that he can be the person who can carry the
Democrats to the White House in 1992,'' she said of party followers
she's met across the country.

   John Zaccaro Jr. has been a model
probationer and should be released early from probation on a
cocaine-selling conviction, his lawyer argued today.
   The son of 1984 vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
was convicted two years ago of selling one-quarter gram of cocaine
for $25 to an undercover officer while a student at Middlebury
College in Vermont in 1986.
   Zaccaro's attorney, Charles Tetzlaff argued that Zaccaro should
be released from probation early because he is beginning his first
semester as a law student at Catholic University in Washington,
D.C., and would have to return monthly to New York state, which is
supervising his probation.
   The District of Columbia won't accept any probation cases unless
there is less than a year in the term.
   Zaccaro has been serving a sentence of one to five years on
probation. But Tetzlaff said that under New York state regulations,
Zaccaro would be eligible for release from probation in December.
   Addison County States Attorney John Quinn argued that Zaccaro
should be supervised for at least another semester because he was
arrested while in a college atmosphere and now he is back in that
atmosphere.
   Vermont District Judge Francis McCaffery made no immediate
decision on the request to dismiss Zaccaro from probation.
   Zaccaro served three months of his sentence under house arrest
at a Burlington luxury apartment whose amenities were ridiculed by
some who argued the former congresswoman's son received special
treatment from the courts.

<HEAD>Prospects Of Female Running Mate For Dukakis Appear Dim</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Michael Dukakis begins the process of
selecting a Democratic vice presidential nominee, the surest bet in
politics is that his choice will be a man.
   Not even the women who worked so hard four years ago to get
Geraldine Ferraro on the Democratic ticket expect Dukakis to follow
Walter F. Mondale's history-making example.
   ``It certainly isn't the top-of-line discussion it was in
1984,'' said Joanne Howes, a political consultant and director of
the non-partisan Women's Vote Project.
   ``Is that a priority in his campaign this year, or in the
party?'' said Irene Natividad, director of the National Women's
Political Caucus. ``It doesn't seem like it.''
   So when Paul Brountas, the Boston lawyer who is heading the
Dukakis search for a running mate came to Washington to talk vice
presidential politics, the big names on his calling list were all
male, names like John Glenn, Sam Nunn, and Bill Bradley.
   He did pay a call on Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. But now
in her second year as a senator, she is on no one's list of vice
presidential prospects.
   Missing from Brountas' list was Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado,
who came close to running for president and is the most credible
vice presidential prospect among Democratic women.
   Three women often are mentioned as potential running mates for
Republican George Bush _ former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and former U.N. Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick. This is the party that turned its back on the
Equal Rights Amendment and demands that its national candidates
take strong stands against abortion.
   Analysts talk of a ``gender gap'' that favors Democrats, the
fact that a far higher percentage of women than men support
Democratic candidates.
   Yet, this election year, the likely women vice presidential
candidates are Republicans, not Democrats.
   ``I think the major reason is obvious,'' said Celinda Lake, a
senior associated with The Analysis Group, a Democratic polling
organization. ``There are lots of ways in which the Democrats are
turning away from the '84 experience.
   ``And one of the ways, which I think is incorrect, is they think
they would not benefit from nominating a woman as the vice
president.''
   The ``'84 experience,'' of course, was the fact the
Mondale-Ferraro ticket was beaten in 49 of 50 states as President
Reagan received an estimated 55 percent of the women's vote.
   ``I also think,'' said Lake ``there is somewhat of a shortage of
women who are both ready and willing. ... Because the Democrats
have been out of office for eight years, we don't have the women in
the administrative pipeline.''
   That view was echoed by others, including Joanne Symons, a
political consultant who worked on Rep. Richard Gephardt's
presidential campaign.
   ``There are not enough (Democratic) women in the pool,'' she
said, because a Republican president has been filling Cabinet
positions the past seven and a half years.
   Lake also cited an ambition factor.
   She listed Gov. Madeleine Kunin of Vermont, along with Schroeder
and Mikulski as Democratic women who have the stature to be vice
presidential candidates and said, ``I don't think they want it.
They want to be No. 1, not No. 2.''
   Howes said, ``The real goal is to be prepared in the 1990s for a
woman to be ready to be president of the United States and to run
for president of the United States and to win.''

FT  15 SEP 92 / NY Senate race sets new standards in seediness

EVERYONE knows that New York politics can be among the roughest and meanest
in the US. But even by New York standards the four-way Democratic Senate
primary race - culminating in today's vote - will go down as one of the most
vitriolic campaigns in many years.
The winner of this melee will challenge Mr Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, a
right-wing politician from suburban Long Island, who has thus far tramped
about the US citing the fact that he has been rebuked rather than censured
by the Senate ethics committee as proof that he has been exonerated of past
influence-peddling charges.
Mr D'Amato is considered vulnerable this year, not least because of his
chequered record. But the Democrats have engaged in so much mud-slinging
that there is unlikely to be much high ground left to be gained by his
opponent.
Although her substantial early lead has nearly evaporated, the front-runner
among the Democrats is 56-year-old Ms Geraldine Ferraro, the former
congresswomen from the Queens who in the 1984 presidential election served
as Mr Walter Mondale's controversial running mate.
Ms Ferraro's troubles first began during the 1984 campaign when allegations
were made about the legality of her husband's business dealings. He pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanour after the campaign.
An unabashed supporter of capital punishment, Ms Ferraro styles herself as a
no-nonsense feminist with a working-class background.
It is the negative campaigning of her rivals that has raised the possibility
that she may not make it after all. Advertisments by rivals have accused Ms
Ferraro's landlord husband of ties to the Mafia and have repeatedly alleged
he rented a house to a child pornographer.
Ms Ferraro's keenest challenger, New York State attorney-general Mr Robert
Abrams, has not been hesitant to make use of the controversy. Neither has Ms
Elizabeth Holtzman, a former congresswomen and New York's current
comptroller.
Oddly enough the only candidate who has not attacked Ms Ferraro over ethics
is the normally demagogic Rev Al Sharpton. He arrived at a televised debate
last week with a symbolic bucket of mud for his colleagues. The debate among
the Senate Democratic primary candidates became so heated that the moderator
kept intervening to say: 'Ladies, ladies, ladies, Ms Holtzman, Ms Ferraro. .
.'
Issues have thus taken a back seat to insults, which means that even if Ms
Ferraro does win today, she is unlikely to be the unblemished sort of
challenger who can make much of the various investigations of Mr D'Amato.
The seediness of this year's New York Senate race looks set to continue.
Jurek Martin adds from Washington; Another race of interest concerns
Congressman Stephen Solarz, the Democratic foreign policy expert.
His old safe House of Representatives seat in Brooklyn has been redrawn  -
with the purpose of promoting Hispanic representation in Congress - and he
may be vulnerable to the challenge of Ms Elizabeth Colon, an advocate of
Puerto Rican interests.

   Today is Saturday, Aug. 26, the 238th day of 1989. There are 127
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Twenty-five years ago, on Aug. 26, 1964, President Lyndon B.
Johnson was nominated for a term of office in his own right at the
Democratic national convention in Atlantic City, N.J. Johnson
appeared before the delegates to announce he had chosen as his
running-mate Minnesota Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, who was also
nominated that night, by acclamation.
   On this date:
   In 55 B.C., Roman forces under Julius Caesar invaded Britain.
   In 1847, Liberia was proclaimed an independent republic.
   In 1873, radio electronics pioneer Dr. Lee DeForest was born in
Council Bluffs, Iowa.
   In 1883, the island volcano Krakatoa began erupting with
increasingly large explosions.
   In 1920, the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution,
guaranteeing American women the right to vote, was declared in
effect.
   In 1933, Helen Hull Jacobs captured the U.S. Lawn Tennis
Association singles title when Helen Wills Moody defaulted in the
third set because of back and hip pain.
   In 1939, the first televised major league baseball games were
shown on station W2XBS _ a double-header between the Cincinnati
Reds and the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field. (The Reds won the
first game, 5-2; the Dodgers won the second game, 6-1.)
   In 1957, the Soviet Union announced it had successfully tested
an intercontinental ballistic missile.
   In 1961, the official International Hockey Hall of Fame opened
in Toronto.
   In 1972, the Summer Olympics opened in Munich, West Germany.
   In 1974, Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly solo, non-stop
across the Atlantic, died at his home in Hawaii at the age of 72.
   In 1978, Cardinal Albino Luciani of Venice was elected the 264th
Pope of the Roman Catholic Church following the death of Paul VI.
The new pontiff took the name Pope John Paul I.
   In 1983, Soviet President Yuri V. Andropov offered to
``liquidate'' his country's medium-range missiles as part of a
superpower agreement on arms reductions.
   In 1987, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his country
would destroy its 72 Pershing I-A rockets if Washington and Moscow
were to scrap all their intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   Ten years ago: An Aeroflot jetliner remained parked at New
York's Kennedy International Airport for a third day, with U.S.
officials continuing to demand an interview with Soviet ballerina
Lyudmila Vlasova, whose husband, Alexander Godunov, had defected.
   Five years ago: Democratic vice-presidential nominee Geraldine
Ferraro celebrated her 49th birthday by noting it was also the 64th
anniversary of women's suffrage and urging women voters to make her
the nation's first female vice president.
   One year ago: Republican George Bush denounced Democrat Michael
Dukakis' criticism of Reagan administration's drug policies as ``an
insult,'' one day after the Massachusetts governor had said U.S.
dealings with Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega were ``criminal.''
   Today's birthdays: Former Attorney General William French Smith
is 72. Washington Post executive editor Benjamin C. Bradlee is 68.
Author Ben J. Wattenberg is 56. Former Democratic vice-presidential
nominee Geraldine Ferraro is 54. Singer Valerie Simpson is 41.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan told a group of schoolchildren
that he believes it's ``inevitable'' that a woman will one day be
president, most likely after first serving as vice president.
   The president's comments came during a question-and-answer
session with junior and senior high school students from four
Washington-area schools.
   ``As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have
met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of England,
Margaret Thatcher, and she's done a remarkable job for England,''
the president said.
   Reagan will play host to Mrs. Thatcher for an official visit and
state dinner at the White House later this week. The British prime
minister has been his closest friend and ally in the Western
Alliance during his nearly eight years in office.
   Reagan said the idea of a woman president would take ``a little
getting used to on the part of some people. But I think it's
inevitable that in this country there will be a woman president
because they've come up in so many different fields.''
   He added: ``It's just my feeling that probably, rather than one
of them just entering the fray to run for president to begin with,
that maybe it would probably start with one of them, as we did in
the election in 1984, ... running for vice president. She didn't
make it, but that might be the start of it, and I welcome it.''
   Reagan was referring to then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., who
had the second spot on the Democratic ticket headed by former Vice
President Walter F. Mondale.

   Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro said Tuesday her son is not living a life of luxury _
despite his $1,500-a-month apartment _ while serving a four-month
sentence for cocaine possession.
   John Zaccaro is staying in a Burlington, Vt., hotel-style
apartment, which has room service and cable TV, as part of a
``house arrest'' program, aimed at easing prison overcrowding.
   ``I go up for weekends and come home and I'm crazy,'' Ferraro
said. ``It's better than being in jail, but ... he's by himself, he
does his own cooking.''
   Ferraro, who was the Democratic vice-presidential candidate in
1984, denied reports that Zaccaro has a servant.
   ``It's not true,'' she said. ``They give you clean linens once a
week and they vacuum.''
   ``We can't apologize for it _ we had to get him housing,''
Ferraro told the New York Post. ``I won't apologize for it.''
   Zaccaro was convicted in April of selling a quarter-gram of
cocaine to an undercover officer while a student at Middlebury
College in 1986. He was sentenced to one to five years in prison,
with all but four months suspended.

<TEXT>
   As I wandered around the floor of the 1984 Democratic convention, the recurring question seemed to be whether a woman could ever be elected president, or even vice president, that office only a heart's beat from the presidency. 

   This year I was a stay-at-home, but judging from the TV coverage the question was whether a black could so aspire. 
Frequently, the question was put bluntly. 
Was the fact that the Rev. Jesse Jackson is black what barred him as Gov. Dukakis's running mate? 

   In neither case were the questions really answered. 
Geraldine Ferraro was nominated for vice president in 1984 but the ticket led by Walter Mondale was defeated. 
Ms. Ferraro's presence on that ticket may have had something to do with it, not just because she was a woman but because of some cloudy matters surrounding her conduct as a congresswoman and her husband's legal problems. 
Besides, that year the Democrats were up against Ronald Reagan, then at the height of his political popularity; any Democratic ticket would have lost. 

   As for Mr. Jackson, there were reasons other than race why he was passed over. 
For one, Mr. Dukakis needed a candidate from Texas -- no Democrat has won the presidency without the Lone Star State -- and Sen. Lloyd Bensten has once before defeated Vice President Bush in Texas and is a proven vote-getter in that state. 

   Moreover, as Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta, himself a black, pointed out, Mr. Jackson for all his charisma has never held a public office or even run for one before. 
Mr. Young thought that a lacuna in the Jackson record. 

   Anyway, the question of a future woman or black as a viable candidate for national office remains moot and will be debatable endlessly. 
For the moment, white males still hold their historical monopoly on both the presidency and vice presidency. 

   I have no crystal ball, but as a senior citizen -- a very senior citizen -- I have a long memory. 
And I remember when other political figures were supposedly unelectable to our highest offices for reasons unrelated to either their sex or their race. 

   From almost the founding of the Republic it was believed that no Roman Catholic could be elected in this basically Protestant country. 
That conventional wisdom seemed borne out by the defeat of Al Smith, the Democratic candidate in 1928. 
Gov. Smith won only 87 electoral votes against Herbert Hoover, and his Catholicism certainly played a part in this. 
There was much dirty propaganda that if Gov. Smith were elected, the pope would sit at his right hand in the Oval Office. 

   But Al Smith was also defeated because he was a premature "wet," favoring the repeal of the Prohibition amendment, and mainly because his opponent was the highly respected Mr. Hoover. 
Because of the Depression that followed, many have forgotten that in 1928 Mr. Hoover was one of our most highly regarded public figures and had been so for 20 years, since his masterly handling of the world relief problem after World War I. 

   Thirty years later, John Kennedy, a devoted Roman Catholic, was elected president with a large share of the votes of the majority Protestants. 
So much for that "conventional wisdom." 

   For a hundred years after our Civil War there was another bit of conventional wisdom: that no Southerner could be elected president. 
True, Woodrow Wilson was born in Virginia, but he won his political fame as governor of New Jersey, so he hardly counted as a Southerner in political terms. 

   But then came Jimmy Carter, a Southerner born and bred, who used the governorship of Georgia as his springboard to the White House. 
He didn't win by much, but he won with a lot of Yankee votes. 
Once more the conventional wisdom got its comeuppance. 

   So I shouldn't be surprised when the day comes that we have a woman or a black (or both) on a winning national ticket. 
Indeed, it may come in the time of many now living and will not seem any more of a "big deal" than having a Southerner or a Catholic in high office. 

   But when that day does come I don't think either will be in the mold of Ms. Ferraro or Mr. Jackson. 
We have long grown accustomed to senators and even governors who are women, and there are many blacks today not only in Congress but as mayors of some of our biggest cities, including Atlanta. 

   These people haven't won their offices by being stridently "feminists" or narrowly black spokesmen. 
They won by exhibiting the same broad regard for their whole constituency as have successful white, male politicians and by a regard for the interests of a broad spectrum of voters. 
They have also learned, often the hard way, how to deal with the problems of government that confront every political leader. 
Neither Ms. Ferraro nor Mr. Jackson fit that mold. 

   Ms. Ferraro had an appealing personality but she floundered when discussing the issues, foreign and domestic, of her time. 
Mr. Jackson is, without doubt, charismatic in person and a stem-winding orator. 
But if that was all that was required we would have had William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896 or 1900, when both times he raised the Democratic delegates to a high pitch of enthusiasm. 

   Jesse Jackson did much the same at this year's convention with a moving sermon, just as he had often done on the campaign trail. 
But a sermon it was, long on idealism and short on ways and means to achieve any of his desires. 
You could applaud the rhetoric but not the political program because you couldn't find one. 

   The future presidential nominee of a woman or a black will seem little different from past or present ones except for their sex or the color of their skin. 
Like their white, male predecessors they will have a record in public service to be examined by the electorate. 
They will doubtless be middle-aged and, whatever their origins, they will share the manner and values of the middle class that embraces the great majority of our voters. 

   When such a candidate, female or black, will make it to the White House I have no idea. 
All I can say is that a remembrance of things past convinces me never to say never in American politics.

   The Justice Department said it dropped the idea of possible court action against former New York Rep. Geraldine Ferraro or her husband, John Zaccaro, in connection with federal financial-disclosure statements. 

   Ms. Ferraro was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1984. 

   Last May, department officials announced the close of a lengthy criminal investigation of the matter, which began in summer 1984, without prosecuting Ms. Ferraro or her spouse. 
But at the time, government attorneys held open the possibility of filing a civil suit over Ms. Ferraro's failure to disclose her husband's finances on annual federal financial reports while she served in Congress. 

   Over the weekend, a Justice Department spokeswoman said the decision came after government attorneys concluded that they didn't have sufficient evidence to show that the former Democratic lawmaker knowingly or willfully violated federal disclosure laws.

Told</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some 1,500 women who spent two days discussing
how they could secure the Constitution's ``blessings of liberty''
were urged to become more active in politics and to run for
elective office.
   It was no accident that the event was sandwiched between last
week's Iowa presidential caucuses and Tuesday's New Hampshire
primary, said Linda Kurtz Hallenborg, a member of the symposium's
executive committee.
   ``This is a way to highlight the fact that we need to get more
women involved in politics,'' she said in an interview Friday. ``We
need to make it clear to the presidential candidates that we make
up 53 percent of the electorate, and women's issues need to be
taken seriously.''
   Those attending the symposium included U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; 1984 vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro; Coretta Scott King, widow of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr.; syndicated newspaper columnist Erma
Bombeck; and former New York congresswoman Bella Abzug.
   The two-day symposium on ``Women and the Constitution'' at the
Carter Presidential Center was convened by former first ladies
Rosalynn Carter and Lady Bird Johnson.
   In speeches and seminars, women who attended the event that
ended Friday heard that political power could be their best hope to
achieve equality in other fields besides politics.
   They also heard that the Constitution, as originally drawn up
200 years ago, deserved criticism as unfair to women and minorities.
   ``Our criticism of the unamended Constitution is not intended to
be divisive,'' said Mrs. King. ``Some people apparently feel that
blacks and women should join in an uncritical celebration of a
document that protected the slave trade and denied women their
democratic rights.''
   Sixty-eight years after the ratification of the 19th Amendment,
which guaranteed women the right to vote, women make up just 14
percent of the higher statewide political officeholders around the
country, according to the National Women's Political Caucus.
   There are 23 women in the U.S. House and two in the Senate. Two
women are governors of states.
   Both Ms. Ferraro and Mrs. King urged women to run for office and
continue working in other campaigns. Ms. Ferraro described a
``ripple effect'' that she discovered when her 1984 campaign
generated thousands of letters from women whom her candidacy had
inspired.
   ``It's the young woman writing after the election, `I've decided
to go to medical school because of you,''' Ms. Ferraro said. ``It's
the 7-year-old writing from her school in Minnesota, `Someday I'm
going to run for president.'
   ``If you don't run, you can't win.''
   While Ms. Ferraro spoke of a future in which women will share
equally in the political landscape, Ms. Hallenborg said the present
administration _ and a return to traditionalism by some women _ has
slowed down the women's movement.
   ``I think the Reagan presidency has been extremely detrimental
to the progress we have made,'' she said. ``Every president up to
Reagan made progress in bringing women into power.''
   The 1988 elections represent an opportunity for women to
reassert themselves at the ballot box, and the outcome could
determine whether eight years of Republican conservatism has
splintered the women's equality movement for good, Ms. Hallenborg
said.
   ``This is a clarion call that women need to rise up and be
counted in the political process,'' she said.

   James Meredith, who broke the
color barrier at the University of Mississippi 26 years ago, said
education remains the best vehicle to break the cycle of poverty
and oppression.
   Meredith, 54, was the first black student to attend the
University of Mississippi in 1962. Violence broke out on the Ole
Miss campus, and President John F. Kennedy called in federal troops
to maintain order.
   Meredith graduated from the university and went on to earn a law
degree at Columbia University.
   In a speech to Air Force Academy cadets Thursday, Meredith said
American blacks need to take more advantage of their citzenship
rights to improve their economic and political opportunities. By
seeking a state-funded education at Ole Miss, Meredith said he
chose to challenge white supremacy.

Ferraro says life at her Fire Island summer home is no day at the
beach _ in fact, she can't even go to the beach because she's so
recognizable.
   That's why Ms. Ferraro and husband John Zaccaro are asking for a
variance to build a swimming pool on their property and provide
them with some privacy.
   ``Because of the burden of celebrity, we are unable to take
advantage of the beach except for early morning or late evening,''
Ms. Ferraro told an unusual Manhattan meeting of the Saltaire
Village Board of Zoning Appeals on Thursday.
   Under village laws, an owner must have at least 10 lots to build
a pool; the former congresswoman and her husband own nine. The
board has reserved decision on the request, but it was not met
enthusiastically by some members.
   ``When we give variances it's usually because of hardship, and I
don't see the hardship here,'' said board member Hilliard Farr, a
summer softball teammate of Zaccaro and his wife.
   Ms. Ferraro ran unsuccessfully in 1984 on the Democratic ticket
headed by Walter Mondale.

   The son of former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro was sentenced Thursday to four months
in jail for selling $25 worth of cocaine to an undercover police
officer.
   John Zaccaro Jr., 24, also was ordered to pay a $1,500 fine and
perform 300 hours of community service.
   ``We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the
sentence,'' Ferraro said, noting that other defendants in Vermont
drug cases have received lighter penalties. She said the conviction
would be appealled.
   During his sentencing hearing, Zaccaro told Vermont District
Judge Francis McCaffrey in a shaky voice that he has sworn off
drugs.
   ``I'd like to make a personal pledge to you and my family that I
will never again be involved in drugs or any illegality,'' he said.
   Zaccaro's attorney, Charles Tetzlaff, asked McCaffrey to accept
a probation officer's recommendation of a suspended sentence,
probation and community service.
   But McCaffrey told Zaccaro, ``I can't in good conscience
sentence you without any time to serve.'' Zaccaro faced a maximum
of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said he was pleased
with the sentence. He denied treating the case differently.
   ``This was a case in which we caught someone red-handed, and I
mean red-handed,'' Quinn said. ``I felt that it was important for
the court to say it doesn't matter who you are. If you commit a
drug offense in the state of Vermont, you'll be treated with great
severity.''
   McCaffrey suggested the jail time be served through the
Chittenden Community Correctional Center in Burlington so that
Zaccaro could participate in a special corrections program that
allows him to be kept under house arrest.
   Quinn said Zaccaro would have to be accepted into the program.
   During the sentencing, Zaccaro stood stoically beside his
father, John Zaccaro, and his mother, who was Walter Mondale's
running mate on the Democratic ticket in 1984.
   Zaccaro was arrested in February 1986 and convicted by a
District Court jury last April. He was arrested after selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to undercover agent Laura Manning while
he was attending Middlebury College, about 30 miles north of
Rutland.
   Manning testified that she went to Zaccaro's off-campus home,
where Zaccaro produced a tray of cocaine packets from underneath
the living room sofa. Zaccaro was arrested that night outside the
restaurant where he worked.
   Tetzlaff argued that police used Manning as bait to snare him
during a college party weekend. The prosecution denied the charge.
   At the sentencing hearing, a tearful Ferraro had asked McCaffrey
not to treat her son differently than any other person convicted of
selling $25 worth of cocaine. She also said Zaccaro's arrest and
conviction have taken a heavy toll on her family and son.
   ``He doesn't go to church with us,'' she said. ``He doesn't want
to be seen with us. It's not because he's ashamed of us. It's
because he's ashamed of what he's done.''
   Also testifying at the sentencing hearing was the Rev. Bruce
Ritter, the founder of a New York City shelter for runaways called
Covenant House where Zaccaro works as a volunteer.
   Ritter said Zaccaro has learned his lesson.
   ``You can't try and reach these kids ... without coming into a
far better and deeper understanding of your own value system,'' he
said. ``Probably the most important things we learn are from our
mistakes. John has learned them.''
   McCaffrey also received 30 letters written on behalf of Zaccaro,
including one from his mother and one from Mondale.
   ``I saw him as a very fine young man who quickly became good
friends with our children and who campaigned in a spirited and
strong way around our nation,'' Mondale wrote.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is ``more a plus than he is
a minus'' on women's issues, but his stance on Contra aid and
defense spending could alienate women voters in November, women's
groups said Tuesday.
   The Texas senator, Democrat Michael Dukakis' running mate
choice, offers a mixed record that could turn some women voters to
Republican George Bush, especially if Bush picks a female running
mate, said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for
Women.
   ``If you're a Democrat it's very worrisome,'' she said.
   Polls have shown that Bush is troubled by a ``gender gap'' that
has many women leaning toward the Democratic candidate in the
presidential race. But the choice of Bentsen doesn't solidify the
women's vote in the Democratic column, the groups said.
   NOW and the bipartisan National Women's Political Caucus rated
Bentsen's record as generally good, based on his support during the
100th Congress of civil rights legislation, Medicaid funding for
abortion in the District of Columbia and his opposition to the
Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork. Bentsen has also supported
the Equal Rights Amendment.
   ``Basically, he's more a plus than he is a minus,'' said Ms.
Yard. ``I think the one thing that disturbs us about him is that he
is very much a hawk. He was pro-Contra aid, and for all the money
spent on defense. He is really business as usual and that's why the
voters want change.''
   Women are more strongly opposed to defense spending and to
Contra aid, she said, because they ``want this world to turn into a
world of negotiation and stop this nonsense about fighting.''
   Irene Natividad, chairman of the National Women's Political
Caucus, said women's groups had not expected this year that
Democrats would name a woman vice president candidate because ``the
sense was that the Democratic Party felt they had already done a
women on the ticket.''
   Geraldine Ferraro, who was Walter Mondale's running mate on the
losing Democratic ticket in 1984, said she was ``delighted'' by the
choice of Bentsen.
   She said she was not disappointed a man had been chosen, since
there were not enough women in national political office to provide
Dukakis with a good choice for a female running mate.
   ``If we had a woman in that Senate seat or in the statehouse
that had the credentials that Senator Bentsen has, I, of course,
would be disappointed. But because we don't have a woman in that
spot, I am not,'' she said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ms. Ferraro said Bentsen ``has been fine on issues that I and
many women care about and in addition to that he's going to be a
very strong help to the ticket, rounding it out beautifully so that
with a Democrat in the White House it's going to make a difference
for the women in this country.''
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., who explored the possibility of
running for president in 1988, said that problems with the economy
are more likely to make women vote Democratic and that Bentsen, as
head of the Senate Finance Committee, offered strong credentials on
that issue.
   ``All the gender gap polling is showing that women are truly
understanding what's wrong with the economy because they're the
ones out there trying to juggle two jobs. They're going to be very
pleased with Bentsen,'' she said.
   ``The real gender gap is generated from women struggling to meet
the family budget every month. Somehow I don't think they're going
to see Bush as identifying with that problem,'' she said.

<HL> Zaccaro's Extortion Trial
Ends With an Acquittal</HL>
<DD> 10/15/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state jury here acquitted the husband of 1984 Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro of extortion charges. 

   John A. Zaccaro, a 54-year-old New York real estate broker, was on trial in his home borough of Queens on charges that he conspired with the borough's then-president in 1981 to solicit a bribe, never paid, from a local cable television concern that was seeking a franchise. 
The innocent verdict, which came after the jury deliberated six hours, wasn't a surprise, because the district attorney's key witness from the cable company had unexpectedly denied Mr. Zaccaro tried to extort money. 

   The former borough president who allegedly conspired with Mr. Zaccaro, Donald Manes, last year committed suicide as he was being drawn into the city's then-emerging corruption scandal. 

   The allegations against Mr. Zaccaro hadn't yet been made when his wife, herself a former Queens prosecutor, was making her vice presidential bid. 
Mr. Zaccaro's attorney, Robert G. Morvillo, borrowed her former running mate's line "Where's the beef?" -- itself borrowed from a Wendy's hamburger ad -- in criticizing the state's case. 

   Standing with his family outside court yesterday, Mr. Zaccaro told a group of reporters that "I'm glad it's over." 
Ms. Ferraro added that she might return to politics.

<HEAD>Mrs. King Criticizes Original Constitution, Says More Hurdles to
Cross</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two hundred years after a group of men gathered
to write the Constitution, women and minorities are closing in on
equal status but still have many hurdles to cross, Coretta Scott
King told a national symposium.
   Mrs. King, wife of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr., said Friday that criticism of the Constitution as it was
adopted in 1787 is justified.
   Her speech came in the closing day of a symposium on women and
the Constitution convened by former first ladies Rosalynn Carter
and Lady Bird Johnson. About 1,500 women from all 50 states and 10
foreign countries attended.
   ``Some people apparently feel that blacks and women should join
in an uncritical celebration of a document that protected the slave
trade and denied women their democratic rights,'' Mrs. King said.
``We still have a way to go before we can say that the Constitution
is working for all Americans.''
   Mrs. King echoed another speaker at the symposium, 1984 vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, in calling for more
political activism on the part of women.
   ``If America is to fulfill the promise of the Constitution, we
will need many more women of all races holding elective office,''
Mrs. King said. ``We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for
nurturing and compassion which has been finely honed and tempered
in our struggle to raise families in a sexist society.''
   ``We just might save this nation from its pending apointment
with Armageddon,'' she said.
   Mrs. King said the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s
laid the groundwork for the women's rights movements of the years
that followed. She said the kind of organized, non-violent dissent
championed by her late husband is still an effective form of
protest.
   ``The (civil rights) movement showed millions of Americans that
you can, indeed you must, defy authority when that authority is in
the wrong,'' Mrs. King said.
   Earlier Friday, Ms. Ferraro said that while no women are among
the candidates for president in either party, women have reached
higher levels in the campaign organizations than ever before.
   ``The women who hold positions of responsibility in presidential
campaigns, whether or not their candidate is ultimately successful,
will forge contacts and gain credibility that will endure beyond
this election cycle,'' she said.
   ``Many of them will be back, with higher ambitions and sharper
skills, in 1992,'' Ms. Ferraro said.
   Ms. Ferraro, whose presence on the 1984 Democratic ticket with
Walter Mondale was a high point for the women's movement, said the
women in some of the 1988 campaigns will go on to be advisers to
the next president.
   ``And that's important, too,'' she said. ``The current
administration has widely been regarded as hostile to women's
issues. That is in part because this president's inner circle of
advisers ... have except for his wife been men.''

FT  17 SEP 92 / Abrams claims victory over Ferraro

<TEXT>
MR Robert Abrams, attorney-general for New York state, yesterday claimed a
razor-thin win over Ms Geraldine Ferraro, former vice-presidential
candidate, in the hotly contested primary battle to become the Democratic
candidate for the New York Senate seat at stake in November.
Ms Ferraro, who was on the receiving end of a vitriolic television
advertising campaign in which Mr Abrams accused her of numerous ethics
violations, was refusing yesterday to concede defeat.
With 99 per cent of precincts having reported, Mr Abrams had 410,402 votes
(37 per cent), while Ms Ferraro had 399,410 votes (36 per cent). Two other
candidates split the rest.
Ms Ferraro, although clearly disheartened after she had spent millions of
dollars on the contest, argued that she might yet win when absentee votes
were counted.
The Democratic victor will run against Senator Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, a
right-wing Republican who has himself been the target of ethics probes and
has been rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee. Mr Abrams, a liberal, has
argued that he is better placed than Ms Ferraro to challenge the senator
over ethics.
In a primary for a Manhattan seat in the House of Representatives, Democrats
elected the late Mr Ted Weiss, although the liberal incumbent had died on
Monday. Now Democratic party leaders will select a candidate to contest the
November election.

   More potential jurors were questioned today
in the cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr., with attorneys asking
panelists about the defendant's mother, former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Questioning resumed after a judge lifted a gag order Monday that
restricted media coverage of jury selection. News organizations
protested, and it was rescinded when all sides agreed to permit a
pool of six reporters.
   All three panelists questioned this morning said they had read
newspaper accounts of the case since Zaccaro was charged in 1986
with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police
agent. Zaccaro was a senior at Middlebury College.
   One potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' Ferraro's family while the former congresswoman was
the Democratic nominee in 1984, and she thought the attacks had
carried over to the son after his arrest.
   However, the unidentified woman said her views would not
interfere with her judgment if she is chosen to hear the case.
   ``The press is not trying this case,'' she said. ``The issue is,
did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   Zaccaro faces a maximum prison term of five years if convicted.
   The long-delayed trial began Monday. Questioning of potential
panelists centered on their political beliefs and their views on
the impact of drugs on society.
   Zaccaro, 24, was accompanied in court by his parents, Ferraro
and John Zaccaro Sr.
   Judge Francis McCaffery imposed the gag order at the request of
defense attorneys, who were concerned that too many reporters in
the room could intimidate potential jurors. But he lifted it after
a challenge from media representatives and an agreement among
lawyers to allow six reporters to observe the proceedings.
   Robert Hemley, a lawyer representing media organizations,
including The Associated Press, told the judge there would be
publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was
public.
   Lawyers on Monday completed initial questioning of at least
seven potential jurors of a pool of more than 20. More than 150
people could be interviewed.
   Several in the jury pool expressed strong feelings about the
role of drugs in society. One man who was dismissed said, ``I'd
probably be the one going to jail if I catch someone selling drugs
to my kid.''
   None of those questioned said Ferraro's place on the 1984
Democratic Party ticket would affect their judgment of her son.
   The trial comes more than two years after Zaccaro was arrested
outside the Middlebury restaurant where he worked.
   The charge involves allegations that Zaccaro sold cocaine to
undercover agent Laura Manning after she came to his off-campus
apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the Vermont courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution
because of his mother.
   But the Vermont Supreme Court refused to dismiss the case.

<P>
Before he first debated Susan Molinari, House candidate Bob Gigante received 
this warning from campaign consultants: "Whatever you do, don't make her cry." 
</P>
<P>
Running against a woman can be a delicate business. Just ask George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember 1984? I can't forget it!" Bush said recently of the presidential 
campaign in which Democrat Geraldine Ferraro ran against him for vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The subject arose after Clayton Williams, the Republican nominee for governor 
of Texas, said he'd rather have state Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox as his opponent 
than Ann Richards, the state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be as comfortable in battling with a woman," Williams was quoted as 
saying before Richards captured the Democratic nomination in the runoff 
election against Mattox last week. 
</P>
<P>
The political landscape is strewn with faux pas committed by men -- mostly 
older men. 
</P>
<P>
"The men are nervous," said Celinda Lake, a pollster for the Democrats. "Women 
running is just plain different, and men sense it." 
</P>
<P>
Bush got himself in trouble in 1984 by saying, after debating Ferraro, that he 
had "kicked a little ass." Later, Mississippi agriculture commissioner Jim Buck 
Ross asked Ferraro if she could bake blueberry muffins. "Yes. Can you?" she 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
Men told women in Wisconsin and New Hampshire that they shouldn't be running 
for Congress because they had young children. One of the candidates, Sen. 
Gordon Humphrey (R-N.H.) later apologized and said his statement had been "just 
plain stupid." 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things you just don't do. I think you have to be a little bit 
more chivalric, if that's the right word," said Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, 
who is running for the Democratic nomination for governor of California against 
Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp promised not to punch his opponent in the nose, but he has taken a 
few verbal swings at her. One of his ads ends with: "Dianne Feinstein -- if she 
couldn't manage a city, how could she manage California?" 
</P>
<P>
Martha Layne Collins, on the other hand, was elected governor of Kentucky in 
1983 "in part because her opponents never could figure out how to run against 
her. They never did point out anything wrong with her," said Democratic 
pollster Harrison Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
"Lesson No. 1 about running against a woman is if it walks like a candidate and 
talks like a candidate, you treat it like a candidate," added Hickman, whose 
clients include Van de Kamp and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who is trying to fend 
off a GOP challenge from Rep. Lynn Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Women such as Martin and Richards, who have hired two of the hardest-hitting 
media consultants in the business, are making it easier for male opponents to 
attack them by proving that they can be as aggressive as the next guy. 
</P>
<P>
They also are coming up with some deft responses to gender-related gaffes, such 
as Ferraro's comeback to Ross's blueberry-muffin question. Richards came up 
with a good one-liner after Williams, a self-styled symbol of Texas machismo -- 
confessed that he wouldn't relish running against her. "Even cowboys get the 
blues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 58, has been blue indeed since he was heard comparing the bad weather 
at his ranch to a rape situation. "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy 
it," he said. The remark last month stirred up a furor, and Williams eventually 
apologized "from the bottom of my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Stone attributed Williams' attitude to his age and upbringing. "His lexicon 
hasn't caught up with the times yet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But while men of Williams' age may not be used to competing with women, many 
younger candidates such as Gigante, 41, consider it perfectly normal. Gigante, 
a New York Democrat with four children and a working wife, was surprised by his 
coaches' advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would she cry?" Gigante asked. "She's a mature woman. She's held office. 
She wasn't going to cry when I attacked her on an issue, just like I wasn't 
going to cry if she attacked me." 
</P>
<P>
Molinari did not cry. She won the election and is serving as a congresswoman 
from Staten Island.

<HEAD>Mondale Urges Dukakis To Use Different Strategy Than His For
Picking Veep</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter F. Mondale says the interviews he held
four years ago with prospective running mates proved a ``damaged
strategy'' and he thinks Michael Dukakis ought to find a different
way of selecting the Democratic vice presidential nominee this year.
   Four years ago, Mondale interviewed a succession of candidates
before he chose Geraldine Ferraro, then a congresswoman from New
York, as the first woman on a major party's national ticket. One by
one, the vice presidential hopefuls visited Mondale at his home in
Minnesota.
   In retrospect, ``I don't think it built confidence,'' Mondale
said of the process. The 1984 Democratic presidential nominee's
comments came in a telephone interview from his Minneapolis law
office on Monday.
   ``I don't think the way that process played out reassured
Americans,'' he said. ``It's a damaged strategy even though it was
not a bad idea.''
   He suggested that Dukakis ``pursue a different way of looking at
vice presidential candidates.''
   Asked if he thought Dukakis, who now appears likely to lock up
the Democratic presidential nomination before the July convention,
should choose a Southerner for his running mate, Mondale said, ``I
wouldn't say he has to. But what I can't figure out is how you get
the numbers if you don't run strong in the South.''
   Mondale was optimistic about the Democrats' chances of winning a
presidential election for only the second time in the last six.
   ``We've got a shot at this deal,'' he said.
   Republican Vice President George Bush ``is a troubled
candidate,'' he said. ``I think he gets off in an uncertain way. I
think there are going to be vulnerabilities on both sides. But
Dukakis looks strong as a person and I don't think Bush does.''
   Mondale said there is a need to ``constantly reassure Americans
that you possess that special presidential strength of character
and independence and resolve to serve the public interest.''
   In recent campaign appearances, Bush often has seemed to be
campaigning against Jimmy Carter, under whom Mondale served as vice
president.
   ``I believe that's a sign of weakness,'' said Mondale. ``Here's
a guy who ought to be filling in the blanks where people are
worried about him, which is character and vision and direction and
presidential status.
   ``Instead, he's out there hacking around against a president
who's been out of office for eight years.''
   Mondale also suggested that Dukakis avoid following his example
of declaring that if elected president he would raise taxes to
reduce the federal deficit.
   ``I think it's too bad ...that we can't talk about our real
problems,'' he said, but ``I think the verdict is in on that.''

<HEAD>History of Vice Presidential Choices Looks to Shape Party Picks in
'88</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush isn't likely to forget that night
in July 1980, when his hopes of being the Republican vice
presidential nominee were dashed and then suddenly restored. It was
a night certain to have a profound impact on how Bush goes about
filling the No. 2 spot on the 1988 GOP ticket.
   Michael Dukakis was only an observer of the long process that
led Walter F. Mondale to the historic decision to fill out the 1984
Democratic ticket with a woman. But the impression that process
created and the impact of disclosures about the dealings of
Geraldine Ferraro's husband are equally certain to affect how
Dukakis chooses a running mate.
   The selection of a running mate is often described as the most
important decision a presidential nominee makes.
   And Dukakis has followed tradition by declaring that his choice
will be dictated by the need to have someone qualified to serve as
president if ``heaven forbid'' something should happen to him.
   Thirteen vice presidents eventually moved to the top office _
eight of them upon the death of the president. Four others were
later elected president, though only one, Martin Van Buren, was
elected while serving as vice president. One vice president, Gerald
R. Ford, gained the presidency when the incumbent, Richard M.
Nixon, was forced to resign.
   Despite the fact that nearly one-third of presidents first
served as vice president, the No. 2 spot on the ticket historically
has gone to someone chosen at the last possible moment for reasons
based far more on politics than qualifications.
   According to Robert F. Kennedy, Texas Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson was
an accidental choice to be John F. Kennedy's running mate in 1960.
   The new book, ``Robert Kennedy, His Own Words,'' quotes Kennedy
as saying that when his brother offered the vice presidential
nomination to Johnson ``he never dreamt there was a chance in the
world he would accept it.''
   After Johnson accepted the offer, Robert Kennedy quoted his
brother as asking, ``Now what do we do?''
   The brothers tried to convince Johnson that putting him on the
ticket would provoke a liberal revolt on the convention floor. But
Johnson said he was willing to risk such a fight.
   As it turned out, Johnson's presence on the ticket was a
critical factor in helping Kennedy carry Southern states,
particularly Texas, in his narrow victory over Nixon.
   Harry Truman was little known outside his home state of Missouri
when he was tapped by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944.
   Roosevelt cared little about the vice presidential nominee as he
prepared to run for a fourth term although he decided well in
advance of the Democratic convention to dump Henry A. Wallace, who
had served four years as vice president and wanted another four.
But Southerners opposed Wallace and he was not well-liked in the
Senate.
   With World War II moving to a close, Roosevelt was looking ahead
to the possibility of Senate fights over peace treaties and
establishment of the United Nations. Truman was popular with his
Senate colleagues.
   In his memoirs, Truman recalled that when he arrived in Chicago
for the convention he brushed aside suggestions that he seek the
vice presidency.
   But Truman's old friend from Missouri, Robert Hannegan, was
Democratic Party chairman, and he was lobbying to get the senator
on the ticket.
   Truman resisted when party leaders asked him to allow his name
to be put forth to the convention as vice president.
   Then came a telephone call from Roosevelt. Hannegan held the
phone away from his ear and Truman could hear the president say,
``Bob, have you got that fellow lined up yet?''
   ``No, he's the contrariest Missouri mule I've ever dealt with,''
replied Hannegan.
   ``Well you tell him if he wants to break up the Democratic Party
in the middle of a war, that's his responsibility,'' said
Roosevelt, who then hung up.
   ``I'll have to say yes,'' Truman told Hannegan.
   Eighty-three days after taking office as vice president, Truman
succeeded to the presidency.
   Ford was the first vice president to attain that office under
the more deliberative process of the 25th Amendment. Then, after he
succeeded Nixon, Ford named Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York
as his vice president. Rockefeller won out over a little-known
Texan named George Bush.
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter settled on Minnesota Sen. Mondale after a
process in which prospective choices trooped to Plains, Ga., to be
interviewed by Carter.
   Eight years later, Mondale used a similar process. The people
who traveled to North Oaks, Minn., included three women, a black, a
Hispanic, and a white Southern senator.
   When Ferraro, a congresswoman from New York, was selected,
feminists were ecstatic. But the benefits Mondale reaped from the
bold choice of a woman quickly faded when the following weeks
brought headlines with accounts of her husband's business dealings.
   Bush was caught in one of the strangest sequences ever at a
nominating convention.
   The scene was Joe Louis Arena in Detroit on the night of July
16. For days Republicans had talked of a ``dream ticket'' made up
of Reagan and Ford. The former president would technically be vice
president but would actually assume far greater responsibilities,
becoming in effect a co-president.
   As the convention got under way that Wednesday night, Bush was
waiting to deliver a unity speech before the balloting to nominate
Reagan.
   He recalled waiting in the wings ``when a backstage worker came
by, patted me on the back, and said, `I'm sorry, Mr. Bush, really
sorry. I was pulling for you.'
   ```Sorry about what?' I asked, as we shook hands.
   ```You mean you haven't heard? It's all over. Reagan's picked
Ford as his running mate.'''
   Bush was described as furious as he left the hall, angry that
the Reagan people had not told him of the decision to choose
someone else.
   But the Ford option was looking less attractive. Among
considerations that disturbed Reagan advisers was the fact that
during the campaign, Ford would be addressed as ``Mr. President,''
while Reagan would be referred to as ``governor.''
   Then Ford appeared on television being interviewed by Walter
Cronkite. He said that he would not go to Washington as ``a
figurehead vice president.''
   Reagan was stunned to see the former president talking on
national television about their private discussions. The
impossibility of the projected arrangement was growing clearer.
   A call went out to Bush.
   ``It came out of the clear blue sky,'' he said. The ticket was
forged.

<HEAD>Opening Arguments Scheduled In Drug Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RUTLAND, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With jury selection almost completed,
opening arguments were scheduled Thursday in the cocaine trial of
John Zaccaro Jr.
   After three days of closely questioning 30 potential jurors,
prosecutors and defense lawyers prepared to narrow the group to the
12 people who will decide whether Zaccaro is guilty of illegally
selling a regulated drug.
   The state maintains that Zaccaro, then a student at Middlebury
College, sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover police
officer two years ago.
   The two sides have closely questioned the potential jurors,
trying to determine any biases stemming from the publicity given
the case and from the fact that Zaccaro, now 24, is the son of
former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Only one juror has been dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of Ferraro could affect his view of the case.
   Many of the potential jurors said they discounted what they had
read, because of a distrust of the press.
   ``They have a tendency to present people as guilty just because
they have been charged,'' said Donald Cioffi on Wednesday.
   Warren Taylor of Chittenden said he was ``not a firm believer in
what the media prints.''
   Another potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' Ferraro's family while she was a candidate in 1984,
and she thought the attacks had carried over to Zaccaro after his
arrest.
   Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., have been present for
the three days of questioning in the cramped chambers of the
presiding judge.
   Police said they began their investigation of Zaccaro after
hearing he was dealing drugs. He is charged with selling the
cocaine to an undercover police officer.
   Defense lawyer Charles Tetzlaff has asked potential jurors if
they would be willing to find someone innocent based on a technical
defect in the state's case. The defense is expected to try to prove
that Zaccaro was entrapped by the police, and that the police
singled him out because of his famous mother.

<HEAD>Bush Won't Elaborate on Advice for Running Against Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he's got some
opinions about running against women candidates, but he won't say
what they are.
   Bush called himself an ``expert in the field,'' referring to his
1984 vice presidential race against then Rep. Geraldine Ferraro.
   He was asked at a news conference if he had any advice for
Clayton Williams, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Texas
whose opponent will be decided in a runoff between Democratic state
Treasurer Ann Richards and Attorney Gen. Jim Mattox.
   Williams has said he would feel less comfortable running against
a woman.
   As for presidential advice, Bush retorted:
   ``I have none at all, but I know exactly what he means and I
refuse to elaborate on it,'' because it could end up ``complicating
his life,'' he said.
   ``Remember 1984. I can't forget it.''
   Williams, he said, is, ``entitled to his opinion. Maybe he's
drawing on my experience.''
   Bush had a hard time competing with the wave of positive feeling
Ferraro's candidacy initially generated among women.
   When at last he felt he had made a strong showing against her in
a televised debate, Bush stated he had ``kicked a little ass'' with
his performance.

   A judge bowed to objections from news
organizations and lifted an order barring reporting on jury
selection Monday at the cocaine-sale trial of John Zaccaro Jr., son
of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   The 24-year-old Zaccaro is charged with selling a quarter gram
of the drug to an undercover officer two years ago while a senior
at Middlebury College. The offense carries a penalty of up to five
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Zaccaro on Monday entered the courtroom separately from his
parents, Ferraro and John Zaccaro Sr., as the long-delayed trial
began. But they sat immediately behind their son.
   In questioning of at least seven potential jurors Monday, none
said Ferraro's candidacy would have any affect on how they would
judge her son.
   Several panelists expressed strong sentiments about drugs. One
juror, who was dismissed, said, ``I'd probably be the one going to
jail if I catch someone selling drugs to my kid.''
   Judge Francis McCaffrey, after a meeting with attorneys, had
imposed an gag order and said only six reporters could attend jury
selection. He said that he expects the process to last three days
and that any information published could prejudice the jury pool.
   ``It is important that we get an impartial jury. That is where
you persons have become an issue,'' McCaffrey told the 11 reporters
in the courtroom. ``Clearly, segregated voir dire is appropriate in
this case.''
   However, after an afternoon hearing on a challenge from several
news organizations, McCaffery lifted the order. But he said only
six reporters would be allowed in the room during the proceedings
and they would have to share their information.
   Robert Hemley, a lawyer representing media organizations,
including The Associated Press, had told the judge there would be
publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was
public.
   ``The issue, then, is, what is happening in the voir dire
process that is different or more damaging (than previous pre-trial
publicity)?'' Hemley said.
   Zaccaro's lawyers, Charles Tetzlaff and Thomas Sherrer, had
requested the order and Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn
did not object. Quinn said he also was concerned about the jury
pool, noting that the case has received widespread publicity
because of Ferraro's prominence.
   Zaccaro is charged with sale of a regulated drug for allegedly
selling cocaine to undercover agent Laura Manning after she came to
his off-campus apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   Zaccaro also had been charged with possession of cocaine with
intent to sell, based on evidence police had found in Zaccaro's
car, including eight grams of cocaine and documents described as
records of drug transactions.
   But the charge was dismissed because of problems with the search
warrant and the lack of other evidence to prove the charge.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the Vermont courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution
because of his famous mother, who ran on the Democratic ticket in
1984 with Walter Mondale.
   Tetzlaff and Sherrer were unsuccessful in having the case thrown
out altogether. The Vermont Supreme Court refused to dismiss the
charges.

<HEAD>Ferraro Offers `Hints' to Dukakis, Warning on Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geraldine Ferraro says she has some
``hints'' for Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis on who should
be his running mate.
   ``If he called me up I might give him a hint or two,'' said the
former congresswoman from Queens, N.Y. and 1984 Democratic vice
presidential candidate.
   Ferraro, 52, also issued a warning about Vice President George
Bush.
   She reminded the 350 people at Thursday's fundraiser for Lt.
Gov. Richard A. Licht about Bush's behavior during their 1984
debate.
   After the contest Bush said he had ``kicked ass.''
   ``You remember how George Bush acted that night,'' Ferraro told
the predominantly female crowd. ``He was so upset. He was serious
one minute and giddy the next ... up down, up down. Talk about mood
swings ... you've got to be careful when you put a man in a
position like that.''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was
poised to solidify his lead among Democratic activists gathering
Saturday for congressional district conventions.
   Dukakis has picked up the endorsement of Iowa Democratic
Chairwoman Bonnie Campbell and all five statewide Democratic
elected officials, has landed two of the state's nine ``super
delegates'' and is scheduled to collect a third on Monday.
   Party leaders predicted he would pick up most of the 34
delegates to be picked at the six conventions.
   ``I think we're likely to see more movement toward Dukakis,''
said Democratic Party spokesman Phil Roeder.
   ``Most people now concede that Mike Dukakis is the
front-runner,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``I am expecting he will get the
lion's share of the delegates.''
   Their comments came on the eve of the district conventions, the
third step in the Democrats' complex method of picking delegates
and hammering out a state platform.

   The state Democratic Party has mailed 65,000
applications for Indiana's first political affinity credit card.
   The VISA card issued by Indiana National Bank could raise as
much as $200,000 a year for the state Democratic party, said state
chairman John B. Livengood.
   The Democratic Party will make a profit off the card by taking a
cut of the fees, typically 5 percent per purchase charged to
merchants and paid to credit card companies.
   The Indiana Democrats will take one-half of 1 percent, said
party treasurer Larry Cummings.
   The card which has a 16.8 percent interest rate and a $3,000
credit line, features a silhouette of a bucking donkey, the party's
symbol.
   Republicans in the state had considered the affinity card idea
but dropped it after deciding too many such cards were already on
the market, said party chairman Gordon K. Durnil.

<HL> Media Got Singed for Overcooking in Quayle Roast </HL>
<AUTHOR> S. Robert Lichter </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<G> EXE CNG </G>
<TEXT>
   Lesley Stahl called him "the vice presidential pick that ate the Republican convention." 
By week's end, however, it was the media that stood accused of a feeding frenzy that featured Quayle under glass. 
Have the media treated Dan Quayle unfairly? 
If so, why are the Republicans leading in the polls for the first time this summer? 
The answers involve not just the media but the way they interact with both the candidates and the public in presidential elections. 

   Sen. Quayle actually received good early notices, according to the Center for Media and Public Affairs' analysis of election news. 
During the networks' Republican convention coverage from Aug. 16 through Aug. 18, most comments about him were positive and even reporters displayed more skepticism than outright criticism. 
This reflects the peculiar status of party conventions as prime-time media events scripted by political consultants rather than network producers. 
Everywhere the cameras turned, they found another delegate waiting to praise the new running mate. 

   The regular evening news was where the coverage got rough. 
During the 12 days after his nomination, the three major networks ran 93 stories on Sen. Quayle. 
That was more stories than any presidential candidate but George Bush attracted throughout the entire primary season. 
And without sound bites from those friendly convention delegates, Sen. Quayle's coverage took a sharp downturn. 
Questions about his military service record popped up in 50 stories. 
His privileged family background came up in 19 stories, and his relationship to lobbyist Paula Parkinson was the focus of 13 reports. 

   On ABC, Democratic pollster Peter Hart called Sen. Quayle "a politically mildewed candidate" whose "odor" is "never going to be erased." 
NBC's Dennis Murphy claimed he would be a "hard sell" to Vietnam veterans. 
Mr. Murphy interviewed one vet who called National Guard service "no different than going to Canada." 
And CBS correspondent Jacqueline Adams termed Sen. Quayle "a not-ready-for-prime-time player" whose "pro-defense rhetoric was almost comical." 

   Overall, only one in three evaluations of Sen. Quayle by reporters and other nonpartisan sources were positive (neutral comments are excluded in the sample). 
That's worse press than any presidential candidate received during the primary race, with the exception of Gary Hart's abysmal 4-to-1 negative ratio. 
By contrast, Mr. Bush's primary coverage was about evenly divided between positive and negative, Michael Dukakis's was nearly 3 to 2 positive, and Jesse Jackson's was 3 to 1 positive. 

   Perhaps the most appropriate comparison, however, is to the 1984 Democratic vice-presidential nominee. 
Geraldine Ferraro was also assailed by charges of scandal or impropriety, and she complained bitterly about her media coverage. 
Yet a study by political scientist Michael Robinson, a self-described liberal Democrat, found that Ms. Ferraro had the most positive "spin" of any candidate on TV news that fall. 
Moreover, questions about her finances and credentials together generated only nine stories on the evening news. 
Ms. Ferraro's foibles were easily eclipsed by TV's attention to Mr. Bush's blunders that year, from his braggadocio that he "kicked a little ass" to his fumbling attempts to define "shame." 

   Even if Ms. Ferraro's media treatment was milder than Sen. Quayle's, the outcome may be instructive for the 1988 race. 
Strong majorities of the public eventually approved of the way she handled questions about her finances, and the controversy apparently didn't affect the election. 
Most people vote for the presidential candidate, not the running mate. 
What did hurt the Democrats was the 2-to-1 majority of those who thought Walter Mondale chose Ms. Ferraro because of pressure from women's groups. 
The vice-presidential choice is important mainly as an indicator of the values and judgment of the presidential nominee. 

   Ironically, that's how the Quayle episode redounded to Mr. Bush's benefit. 
The controversy allowed Mr. Bush to reinforce his powerful acceptance speech with an object lesson in leadership. 
He was on-screen every night defending his running mate in a manner that displayed the decisive, steadfast, take-charge image his advisers have long hoped for. 

   Even in an age of image-making, of course, reality still counts in politics. 
If the "draft-dodger" label had stuck, Sen. Quayle might well have taken Mr. Bush down with him. 
Instead Sen. Quayle ended up looking unfairly maligned by the media attack pack, and Mr. Bush dominated the public agenda with a successful defense of both his subordinate and his own judgment. 
The payoff was the biggest post-convention "bump" in the polls since 1972. 
No wonder Pat Buchanan was moved to say, "Thank you Dan Rather." 

   The Democrats still have plenty of time to rebound from the GOP's August surprise. 
The real victim of the Quayle hunt was the media. 
The latest "Times Mirror" polls show that majorities of the public think the story was overplayed and unfair to Sen. Quayle. 
More significantly, the proportion of those who see a Democratic bias in the news has more than doubled since May (from 10% to 22%), and the proportion of those who believe news organizations "get the facts straight" has dropped from 49% to 40%. 

   As Dan Rather learned in his set-to with Mr. Bush in January, attack journalism is not without risk. 
When the press takes on the role of political opposition, the electorate may reject the messenger as well as the message. 
That's why two weeks of roasting Quayle left the Republicans fat and happy but gave the networks indigestion.

   Ronald Reagan didn't choose his vice
presidential running mate until almost the last minute, Jimmy
Carter conducted a long, boring search, and Adlai Stevenson
declined to choose at all. They all did it their way and so did
George Bush.
   Bush's decision to keep everybody guessing _ until Tuesday
afternoon _ was the No. 2 topic at the Republican National
Convention, which had little else to talk about. No. 1, of course,
was the choice itself.
   Bush brought all that speculation to an abrupt end Tuesday
afternoon with his announcement that he had selected Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana as his running mate.
   In holding his cards close to his vest, Bush was only doing unto
others what Reagan did to him. All evening, on Wednesday of 1980
Republican Convention week in Detroit, it looked as if former
President Gerald Ford would be Reagan's choice for vice president.
The way Ford saw it, if they won they would have sort of a shared
presidency.
   But at 11:15 p.m. Reagan and Ford agreed not to be a team and
Bush received a telephone call. As Bush recalls in his
autobiography, the conversation went like this:
   ``Hello, George, this is Ron Reagan. I'd like to go over to the
convention and announce that you're my choice for vice president if
that's all right with you.''
   ``I'd be honored, Governor.''
   ``George is there anything at all ... about the platform or
anything else, anything that might make you uncomfortable down the
road.''
   Bush could think of nothing. A few minutes after midnight,
Reagan made an unusual trip to convention hall to announced his
choice, a dramatic end to a dramatic night of speculation and rumor.
   Despite the long list of vice presidential hopefuls that came to
be interviewed in Plains, Ga. in 1976, Carter didn't announce his
choice of Walter Mondale until Thursday, the day the vice
presidential nomination went before the delegates.
   The fact that both tickets with last minute running mate choices
won probably hadn't escaped Bush. The fact that Walter Mondale
picked Geraldine Ferraro in advance in 1984 _ and they lost the
election _ might also have made an impression.
   The choice of a running mate is probably the most important
early decision a presidential candidate makes. Thirteen vice
presidents have become president, eight on the death of a president.
   In 1956, Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson startled the
convention in Chicago by leaving the choice of his running mate to
the delegates. As a result, votes were distributed among 13
candidates after the first ballot.
   Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee had 483{ votes, followed by
Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts with 304 and Sen. Albert Gore
of Tennessee with 178.
   On the second ballot, Kennedy had the lead after the roll call,
but before the chair recognized vote changes. Gore pulled out,
began a bandwagon for Kefauver, and Kennedy moved that Kefauver's
nomination be made unanimous. The ticket lost.
   With that exception, every vice presidential nominee in modern
times has been the presidential nominee's choice _ albeit an uneasy
choice, sometimes. In 1944, Franklin D. Roosevelt didn't want to
run with Vice President Henry Wallace but had no other favorite. He
was persuaded to accept Harry S. Truman, who then succeeded him 82
days after the inauguration when Roosevelt died.
   In 1960, Kennedy offered the No. 2 spot to Lyndon B. Johnson,
thinking that his chief opponent for the presidential nomination
would not accept. Johnson did, helped Kennedy win by bringing in
Southern states, and became president when JFK was assassinated in
1963.
   When Johnson ran for president in 1964, Republican nominee Barry
Goldwater picked Rep. William E. Miller as a teammate, saying ``one
of the reasons I chose Miller is that he drives Johnson nuts.''

   Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro says she partly blames herself and her candidacy for her
son's cocaine conviction because it made him ``a target,'' and says
the family will appeal the verdict to the Vermont Supreme Court.
   ``We still believe he was set up,'' said Ferraro of her
24-year-old son, John Zaccaro Jr. But she acknowledged that he had
possessed cocaine, and said his legal troubles showed him ``the
horrors of drugs.''
   A Vermont District Court jury deliberated for slightly more than
two hours Saturday before finding Zaccaro guilty of selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police officer while
he was a senior at Middlebury College two years ago.
   No sentencing date was set, and an appeal could take two years.
The felony conviction carries a maximum sentence of five years in
jail and a $10,000 fine.
   In a statement after the verdict, Ferraro blamed her son for
possessing cocaine, as well as herself ``and my candidacy for
making my son a target.'' Ferraro ran on the Democratic ticket with
Walter Mondale in 1984.
   ``We are a concerned family who has lived through a very
difficult two years,'' she said. ``We love our son. We do not
minimize in any way his use of drugs at Middlebury College or the
fact that Middlebury College is the place where drugs was available
to so many students and continues to be so. It was wrong.''
   ``There are four people who are guilty in this whole episode,''
Ferraro said. ``John for possession. We are grateful that God has
chosen this way to show him the horrors of drugs. Me and my
candidacy for making my son a target.''
   Ferraro's statement went on to name former Middlebury police
Sgt. David Wemette ``for setting my son up'' and Addison County
State's Attorney John Quinn for ``prolonging the agony for two
years'' by rejecting a plea bargain.
   ``We, as his parents, would not allow him to plead guilty'' to
the felony charge of selling cocaine, Ferraro said. The family had
asked prosecutors to allow Zaccaro to plead guilty to a lesser
charge of possession of cocaine.
   But Quinn would not accept a plea for less than a felony.
   ``If she wants to be angry at me for not reducing the charge,
that's her prerogative. I didn't feel there was any justification
for reducing the charge,'' Quinn said. ``There was plenty of
evidence he was selling. I never considered a possession case and
they know that,'' he added.
   Ferraro pointed to several drug cases recently heard in Vermont
in which plea bargains were arranged easily and light sentences
were given to defendants accused of selling larger quantities of
drugs.
   ``That may or may not be true. I know there are some cases like
that. It depends on the particular prosecutor. It depends on the
particular circumstances of the case,'' Quinn said.
   ``I recently prosecuted a guy on a felony charge for 37
marijuana plants. Perhaps in some counties they might have reduced
that. But as time goes on, I feel more strongly about drug cases. I
just think it's becoming more of a problem in the country and we
need to deter that,'' Quinn said.
   The defense also had raised the argument that Zaccaro was
unfairly singled out because of the publicity surrounding his
mother, but the Vermont Supreme Court refused to overturn the
charges on that basis.
   Jury selection lasted four days, prolonged by wide publicity the
case had gained, but the verdict came only one day after the trial
itself began.
   Opening arguments and testimony began Friday, with the defense
claiming Zaccaro was entrapped by a young, inexperienced,
attractive undercover police officer. ``This is a case of improper
and overzealous police conduct,'' Zaccaro's lawyer, Charles
Tetzlaff, argued.
   He called no witnesses, instead basing his defense on attacks on
the prosecution witnesses and attempting to show the police
investigation was based purely on rumor and that the undercover buy
was poorly executed.
   But Quinn said Zaccaro was a well-organized drug dealer. He
described the deal with undercover officer Laura Manning as just
another sale.
   ``When he takes a packet off the tray, he opens it up, being the
good merchant that he is, ... looks at it, wraps it up'' and gives
it to Manning, Quinn said.
   Manning's drug buy came Feb. 20, 1986. Quinn said it was
arranged after an anonymous note was left on Wemette's desk in the
fall of 1985 with Zaccaro's name, address, car registration and the
words: ``The Pharmacist.'' Police and prosecutors said Zaccaro had
earned the nickname because of his reputation as a drug dealer.
   Wemette testified he first heard rumors of Zaccaro's drug
dealing in 1984, but did not pursue them because Zaccaro left
college to help his mother's campaign.
   Most Middlebury students questioned about the case said the
outcome did not concern them. ``My sophomore year it was more
interesting. But now, half the people on campus weren't even
here,'' said Bob Woithe, a senior from Palm Island, Fla.
   The college had reacted to the arrest by forming a task force
that made 20 recommendations to address student drug abuse, most of
which have been adopted. They include the hiring of a health
educator, publication of a drug brochure, additional security
staff, and improved relations with the Middlebury police.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Continues In Zaccaro Case</HEAD>

   Potential jurors questioned Tuesday in the
cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr. said their judgment would not be
influenced by the fact that the defendant's mother is former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   One potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' Ferraro's family while she was a candidate in 1984,
and she thought the attacks had carried over to Zaccaro after his
arrest.
   The questioning was watched by six reporters one day after Judge
Francis McCaffrey imposed and then lifted a gag order.
   Most of the jurors questioned said they had read newspaper
accounts of the case since Zaccaro was charged in 1986 with selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent. Zaccaro,
24, was then a senior at Middlebury College.
   The offense carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and
a $10,000 fine.
   ``I can't say I don't feel the press picked on these people,''
said Joanne Cillo said when asked if she was pleased with how
Ferraro has been treated.
   But she said her views would not interfere with her judgment if
she is chosen to hear the case.
   ``The press is not trying this case,'' she said. ``The issue is,
did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   Ferraro, a lawyer, sat behind her son and his lawyers taking
notes intently. But she stopped when Cillo spoke about the
treatment her family received, rested her head in her hands and
looked down.
   John Zaccaro Sr. accompanied his wife and son on the second day
of questioning.
   None of the other jurors questioned so far have said they would
be influenced by the fact Ferraro is Zaccaro's mother. ``It
wouldn't matter one way or another who she was,'' Ellen Daly of
Rutland said.
   At the noon break, Ferraro declined to comment, telling one
reporter, ``It's nothing against you personally. We're just not
answering anything for anybody.''
   McCaffery had imposed the gag order Monday in response to
complaints by defense attorneys that the presence of too many
reporters could intimidate potential jurors. News organizations
protested, and it was rescinded later that day when all sides
agreed to permit a pool of six reporters.
   Prosecutor John Quinn said he was not sure how long it would
take to pick a jury.
   Pre-trial publicity seemed less of a problem than the jurors'
opinions about drug use.
   One man who was dismissed said, ``I'd probably be the one going
to jail if I catch someone selling drugs to my kid.''
   The trial comes more than two years after Zaccaro was arrested
outside the Middlebury restaurant where he worked.
   The charge involves allegations that Zaccaro sold cocaine to
undercover agent Laura Manning after she came to his off-campus
apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the Vermont courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution
because of his mother, but the Vermont Supreme Court refused to
dismiss the case.

<HEAD>Judge Sentences Ferraro's Son to Four Months</HEAD>

   A judge has sentenced John Zaccaro Jr. to
four months in prison for selling cocaine to an undercover police
officer, rejecting Geraldine Ferraro's plea that ``my son has been
punished enough.''
   Vermont District Court Judge Francis McCaffrey also ordered
Zaccaro to pay $1,500 and perform 300 hours of community service
during his sentencing Thursday. Zaccaro, 24, could have faced up to
five years and a $10,000 fine for selling one-quarter gram of
cocaine in 1986.
   Zaccaro is free during the 30 days he has to appeal the
sentence. His mother, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential
nominee, said after the hearing that her son had been treated
differently than the average defendant.
   ``We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the
sentence,'' Ferraro said, noting that other defendants in Vermont
drug cases have received lighter penalties. Zaccaro's attorney,
Charles Tetzlaff, had requested a suspended sentence with probation
and community service.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn, who had requested a
jail term, denied that he had treated the case differently.
   ``This was a case where we caught a person red-handed, and I
mean red-handed,'' Quinn said. ``I felt that it was important for
this court to say it doesn't matter who you are, you're not going
to escape the consequences of selling cocaine in this state.''
   McCaffrey said he was at a loss to understand why Zaccaro sold
drugs, saying the only explanation he could think of was greed and
a desire for acceptance by his peers.
   ``I can't in good conscience sentence you without any time to
serve,'' the judge said. McCaffrey said that Zaccaro had grown up
with every advantage, including a good education and family support.
   McCaffrey suggested that the jail time be spent in special
Vermont corrections program that allows convicts to be kept under
house arrest with supervision by a probation officer. But Quinn
said later that Zaccaro must still be accepted into the program.
   Zaccaro's parents sat quietly and leaned forward as McCaffrey
passed sentence.
   In a hearing before McCaffrey's decision, Ferraro broke down in
tears on the stand as she described her reaction to her son's
February 1986 arrest. She was in Hawaii giving a lecture that day
and had to watch the event on television.
   ``When I got home from Hawaii, I went home and my son put his
arms around me and he cried and he said he was sorry,'' Ferraro
recalled. ``He was sorry for what he had done to us.''
   Zaccaro held his head in his hands as his mother described the
impact the case had on the family.
   Ferraro, a former New York prosecutor, criticized Quinn for
failing to allow a plea bargain.
   ``I have never had a case where people weren't interested in
discussing any sort of disposition,'' Ferraro said, adding that the
defense had ``begged and pleaded'' for an agreement.
   ``If it had been anyone else ... we would not be sitting here,''
she said. ``My son has been punished enough. I want him back. I
want him back so that we can start our lives all over again.''

   Mindful of Geraldine Ferraro's ill-fated vice
presidential quest in 1984, Michael Dukakis had aides accompany
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen on his first campaign solo flight.
   The 67-year-old Bentsen is no stranger to campaign work, and the
silver-haired senator took several of his own aides with him on the
campaign foray to California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas last
week.
   Officials in both the Dukakis and Bentsen camps remember how
Ferraro, Walter F. Mondale's running mate four years ago, hit the
campaign trail unprepared, and want to closely coordinate campaign
activities.
   Mrs. Ferraro badly mishandled the controversy surrounding her
husband's finances, and the issue quickly destroyed any momentum
the Democrats had following their nominating convention in San
Francisco. The ticket went on to lose 49 of the 50 states to Ronald
Reagan.
   ``They put her out, basically without any senior help from the
Mondale campaign,'' said Francis O'Brien, who had been called in to
help rescue the Ferraro campaign, and was on the Bentsen plane last
week.
   Four years ago, ``there was a lack of communication between the
two campaigns,'' he said. ``People who went through that experience
learned from that experience.''
   O'Brien led a cadre of Dukakis people on the Bentsen plane,
including Tad Devine, the Dukakis chief delegate-counter before the
convention, who will coordinate and direct the senator's campaign
from the Dukakis headquarters in Boston. Devine also worked for
Mondale four years ago.
   But Bentsen also will keep a group of his long-time advisers
with him to handle day-to-day issues.
   ``We've done a very good job of integrating the Dukakis staff,''
said Joseph O'Neill, a former Bentsen aide on Capitol Hill, who
will become his top traveling campaign staffer.
   A formal announcement of the campaign staff is planned later
this week, said Jack DeVore, Bentsen's spokesman.
   Bentsen's campaigning was kept at a deliberate pace last week
with careful staging of each event.
   His speeches were cautious, citing his Senate record on issues
of interest to each audience and working in some digs at the Reagan
administration _ but avoiding harsh attacks.
   Care was also taken to emphasize areas where he and Dukakis
agree.
   While the Bentsen choice is certainly a lot less daring than
Mondale's Ferraro decision, Bentsen and Dukakis probably have more
disagreements on policy. Bentsen is much more conservative on some
issues, including his opposition to gun control, support for aid to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and school prayer.
   The political message for the trip was found mostly in the
locations, which were designed to highlight the Dukakis campaign
theme of aggressively going after electoral votes that the
Republicans have controlled for years. The Democrats last won Texas
in 1976, and haven't won New Mexico, Nevada or California since
1964.
   Bentsen, a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, found a
friendly audience with a businesswomen's group in Albuquerque. He
played a ``come home to the Democratic Party'' theme to a union
audience in San Francisco, in Nevada and at his Texas stop in
Amarillo _ a Republican area that's home to his opponent in this
year's Senate race, Rep. Beau Boulter.
   As permitted by Texas law, Bentsen is running for the vice
presidency and the Senate at the same time.
   The trip hit two areas a day, instead of the three-a-day planned
for later in the campaign.
   As a state-wide campaigner in Texas, the national campaign isn't
as big a step up for Bentsen as it was for Ferraro, a member of the
House from Queens, N.Y. Bentsen also has the experience of his
unsuccessful 1976 campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   The senator said that from his viewpoint ``it's gone very
well,'' and he was surprised he didn't face a sea of Bush signs at
his rally in Amarillo.
   ``I think we could have done a few more things,'' he said. ``But
we wanted some time in there in case things weren't working out.''
   The trip was cut short by a day when the campaign canceled a
planned visit to Mississippi because of a conflict with Dukakis'
schedule.
   Bentsen returned to Washington, where he plans to immerse
himself in a heavy Senate schedule including action on the trade
and plant-closing notification bills.
   Dukakis aides said Bentsen's congressional schedule was a plus
even though it will cut into his campaign time. One aide said it
provides ``meat and potatoes'' for the Democratic effort.
   Bentsen says he expects to campaign in Texas, the South and
Southwest. But aides say it's still to be decided how the
candidate's time will be apportioned.
   ``That's going to be a part of the discussion'' as the campaign
begins to nail down staffing and strategy in the next few days,
O'Neill said Friday.
   On the road, Bentsen said he was encouraged by the large number
of local officials who want to appear on the dais with him and
Dukakis when they hit town.
   Aides said that kind of reaction is a good indication of the
level of local support.

   A prosecutor says he refused to reduce a
felony charge against John Zaccaro Jr. because ``there was plenty
of evidence'' that the son of former vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro was selling cocaine.
   Ferraro said she and her candidacy were partly to blame for her
son's conviction Saturday, but blasted Addison County State's
Attorney John Quinn for failing to accept a plea bargain.
   Quinn said he was reluctant because of the problem of drugs in
society.
   ``I recently prosecuted a guy on a felony charge for 37
marijuana plants. Perhaps in some counties they might have reduced
that. But as time goes on I feel more strongly about drug cases,''
Quinn said Sunday. ``I just think it's becoming more of a problem
in the country and we need to deter that.''
   Zaccaro, 24, was convicted of selling one-quarter gram of
cocaine to an undercover officer at his off-campus apartment on
Feb. 20, 1986. He was a senior at Middlebury College at the time.
   No sentencing date has been set. The felony conviction carries a
maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $10,000 fine.
   At a news conference after the verdict, Ferraro said the family
would appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court.
   ``We still believe he was set up,'' she said.
   Ferraro blamed her son for possession of cocaine, as well as
herself ``and my candidacy for making my son a target.'' She was
the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984.
   But she said Quinn prolonged ``the agony for two years'' by not
allowing Zaccaro to plead to a lesser count of cocaine possession.
   ``We, as his parents, would not allow him to plead guilty'' to
the felony charge of selling cocaine, Ferraro said.
   ``To me it was clearly a selling case,'' said Quinn, who said
the family first approached him about a pea agreement at Zaccaro's
arraignment. ``There was plenty of evidence he was selling. I never
considered a possession case and they know that.''
   He added, ``If she wants to be angry at me for not reducing the
charge, that's her prerogative. I didn't feel there was any
justification for reducing the charge.''
   Zaccaro's defense lawyer, Charles Tetzlaff, had argued that his
client was entrapped by a young, inexperienced, attractive female
undercover police officer.
   ``This is a case of improper and overzealous police conduct,''
he told jurors.
   But Quinn called Zaccaro a well-organized drug dealer, and said
he was known on campus as ``The Pharmacist'' because of his
reputation as a dealer.
   After Zaccaro's arrest, Middlebury College officials formed a
task force to look at the campus drug problem. After more than a
dozen meetings, it made 20 recommendations, most of which were
implemented by college trustees.
   They included the hiring of a health educator, publication of a
drug brochure, additional security staff, and improved relations
with the Middlebury police.
   Most Middlebury students questioned about the case said the
outcome did not concern them. ``My sophomore year it was more
interesting. But now, half the people on campus weren't even
here,'' said Bob Woithe, a senior from Palm Island, Fla.

   Democratic Rep. Patricia Schroeder, who scrapped her possible presidential candidacy last month, isn't the only woman who has decided not to run for high federal office this time around. 

   It's still early yet, but candidate recruiters from both parties say they are having trouble getting women to run for the House and Senate in 1988. 
The bipartisan Women's Campaign Fund candidate school has signed up only about half a dozen potential 1988 House candidates, and neither party anticipates having a serious female contender for the Senate next fall. 
There are currently 23 female House members and two female senators. 

   Record numbers of women are running for and winning state and local offices, and the number of women nominees for federal office rose steadily from three Senate and 44 House candidates in 1974 to 10 Senate and 65 House candidates in 1984. 
But the number of federal candidates has reached a plateau since then, and some analysts say it could even decline next year. 

   "We're still trying to find bodies," says Linda DiVall, a GOP pollster and consultant to the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
Observes Vermont Democratic Gov. Madeleine Kunin, who is seeking re-election rather than running for an open Senate seat next year: "There's a feeling not only among candidates, but women supporters are less willing to say, 'Run, run, run.'" 

   Many political analysts figured that Rep. Geraldine Ferraro's selection as the Democratic vice presidential candidate would set off a wave of women candidates. 
But the euphoria of Ms. Ferraro's candidacy has faded now, and analysts say the present mood is colored by disappointment at the embarrassment the public limelight has caused her family and at Mrs. Schroeder's tearful decision not to run for president. 

   The Ferraro experience especially seems to have caused some women to have second thoughts. 
"I have heard some women in politics say: 'I wouldn't like what happened to Gerry Ferraro to happen to me. 
I don't know if I'm willing to expose myself to that sort of brutal pressure,'" says Ruth Mandel, director of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University. 
The recent string of scandals in the campaigns of male Democratic presidential candidates has also contributed to a "chilling effect," Gov. Kunin says. 

   The issue of spousal financial disclosure has proven to be a particular stumbling block. 
Women candidates more frequently have spouses with business dealings, which must be disclosed publicly under federal law. 
California Secretary of State March Fong Eu, considered a formidable potential challenger to GOP Sen. Pete Wilson, now isn't expected to run in the Democratic primary because her husband doesn't want to disclose his finances. 
"If he doesn't disclose, she can't run," says Joanne Howes, a veteran political consultant. 

   Colorado Rep. Schroeder's complaint that she was under pressure to change her style and give up too much of herself to run for president strikes a chord among other women officeholders as well. 
"I think a woman can do it," says Kansas Republican Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, who is often mentioned as a possible GOP vice presidential prospect. 
"That's not the question in my mind. 
It's 'How much do you want to give up?'" 

   The controversy about Mrs. Schroeder's show of emotion when she announced she wasn't running "is another example of the extraordinary burden that any individual political woman carries with her," says Ms. Mandel. 
"She can never run without everything that she does being judged as a statement about womankind in general." 

   Most women suggest that the current reluctance to run for federal office will prove temporary. 
"There aren't very many running at the upper reaches, but there are a lot in the pipeline," emphasizes Anne Wexler, a Washington lobbyist who helped run Ms. Ferraro's campaign. 
She and others are encouraged that women are choosing races they're more likely to win, are moving up steadily in state government, and now hold powerful behind-the-scenes jobs on campaigns and in congressional offices. 
"The landscape in Washington is totally different from what it was 10 years ago," she concludes. 

   Eleanor Smeal, former president of the National Organization for Women, has launched a new group called the Fund for the Feminist Majority, which is sending speakers around the country urging women to run for all levels of government office. 

   But Sen. Kassebaum observes that there are still too few role models at the top to break the ice with the voters. 
"We haven't had a woman who's secretary of defense, secretary of state," she says. 
"We've never had a woman really in the top inner council of government." 

   There also are special factors in the 1988 cycle that are limiting the pool of women running for national office. 
There are fewer open seats available than in previous recent congressional elections. 
"This looks like a bad year to run for Congress, and women know it," says Celinda Lake of the Women's Campaign Fund. 
In addition, the free-for-all presidential race in both parties has siphoned off women who might be congressional candidates in other years but who instead are working for presidential hopefuls. 

   But analysts also are concerned about other long-term reasons why women may not be running for federal office. 
A Women's Campaign Fund survey found that women officeholders are less likely to attempt a major political leap upward -- say from school board to Congress -- than are their male counterparts. 

   "I sometimes conclude, and it is a reluctant conclusion, that women continue to harbor some inner barriers," Gov. Kunin told the National Women's Political Caucus convention this summer. 
"At some gut level, the art of politics -- combative, competitive, self-asserting -- is sometimes difficult to integrate with our feminine selves." 

   Even when they don't have such internal doubts, women candidates for federal office still have an uphill struggle with the electorate. 
While The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has shown a steady increase since 1984 in the number of Americans who think the country is ready for a woman president, 65% still don't think the country is prepared for such a change. 
A new survey for the National Women's Political Caucus by Ms. DiVall and another pollster, Harrison Hickman, found that while 20% of Americans think a woman would do better than a man in serving on a school board, 13% think she would do a worse job in the House, 16% think she would do a worse job in the Senate and 31% think she would do worse as president. 

   Despite all the gains of recent years in the number of women candidates and officeholders, a woman running for federal office still "has to be better, stronger and sharper than a male counterpart with all the same credentials if she is going to win," concludes Ms. DiVall.

   Before his first debate with Susan Molinari,
House candidate Bob Gigante received an unusual warning from his
consultants: ``Whatever you do, don't make her cry.''
   Running against a woman can be a delicate business. Just ask
George Bush.
   ``Remember 1984? I can't forget it,'' Bush said recently of his
vice presidential race against Democrat Geraldine Ferraro.
   The subject arose after Clayton Williams, the Republican nominee
for Texas governor, said he'd rather run against state Attorney
General Jim Mattox than state Treasurer Ann Richards. The two
Democrats are in a runoff April 10.
   ``I wouldn't be as comfortable in battling with a woman,''
Williams said.
   ``I know exactly what he means and I refuse to elaborate on
it,'' Bush sympathized.
   And no wonder. The political landscape is strewn with faux pas
by men _ mostly older ones _ more accustomed to thinking of women
in the kitchen than on the campaign trail.
   ``The men are nervous,'' says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.
``Women running is just plain different and men sense it.''
   ``They are very confused,'' adds Republican pollster Ann Stone.
``The rules have changed very quickly over the last 10 to 15 years.
You've got to kind of feel sorry for them. ... Maybe their heart's
now in the right place but their mouth's not there yet.''
   Bush got himself in trouble six years ago when he boasted that
he had ``kicked a little ass'' in a debate against Ferraro. The
same race featured Mississippi agriculture commissioner Jim Buck
Ross asking Ferraro if she could bake blueberry muffins. ``Yes. Can
you?'' she replied.
   A few years later, men told women in Wisconsin and New Hampshire
that they shouldn't be running for Congress because they had young
children. One of the candidates, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
later apologized and called his statement ``just plain stupid.''
   ``There are some things you just don't do. I think you have to
be a little bit more chivalric, if that's the right word,'' said
California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who is vying with
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination.
   Van de Kamp offered only one specific: he wouldn't punch his
opponent in the nose. But he still is taking a few swings at
Feinstein, including an attack ad that ends, ``Dianne Feinstein _
if she couldn't manage a city, how could she manage California?''
   In contrast, Martha Layne Collins was elected governor of
Kentucky in 1983 ``in part because her opponents never could figure
out how to run against her. They never did point out anything wrong
with her,'' said Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman.
   ``Lesson No. 1 about running against a woman is if it walks like
a candidate and talks like a candidate, you treat it like a
candidate,'' added Hickman, whose clients include Van de Kamp and
Sen. Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat trying to fend off a
challenge by GOP Rep. Lynn Martin.
   Women like Martin and Richards, who have hired two of the
hardest-hitting media consultants in the business, are making it
easier for men to attack by proving that they can be as aggressive
as the next guy.
   They also are coming up with some deft responses to
gender-related missteps.
   Ferraro's good-natured comeback to Ross's blueberry muffin
question was considered ideal. Richards came up with a good
one-liner after Williams _ a self-styled symbol of the
free-wheeling, boot-wearing Texan _ confessed he wouldn't relish
running against her. ``Even cowboys get the blues,'' she said.
   Williams, 58, has been even bluer since he compared the bad
weather at his ranch last month to a rape. ``If it's inevitable,
just relax and enjoy it,'' he said. The incident created a furor
and Williams eventually apologized ``from the bottom of my heart.''
   Stone attributes Williams' remarks, both on rape and running
against women, to his generation and upbringing in Texas. ``His
lexicon hasn't caught up with the times yet,'' she said.
   But while men of Williams' age may not be used to competing with
women, many younger candidates like Gigante, 41, consider it
routine. The New York Democrat, who has four children and a working
wife, was surprised by his coaches' advice to be tough on Molinari
without making her cry.
   ``Why would she cry?'' Gigante asked. ``She's a mature woman.
She's held office. She wasn't going to cry when I attacked her on
an issue just like I wasn't going to cry if she attacked me.''
   For the record, Molinari did not cry. She won the election and
was sworn in last week as a Republican congresswoman from Staten
Island.
