Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, aims to establish
itself as the leading software supplier for interactive broadband networks
that will provide interactive television and home PC services.
The company yesterday announced an 'end-to-end software solution' for
interactive TV, including distributed operating system software for
connecting television set-top boxes and personal computers with a wide
variety of services, plus media server software for delivering video on
demand and a set of interactive system applications.
The Microsoft software is to be tested in an interactive TV trial being
staged next year in Seattle, Washington, by Tele-Communications, the largest
US cable-TV operator.
Microsoft yesterday announced agreements with other network operators
including Deutsche Telekom, Telstra of Australia and US West Communications,
a regional US telephone company, which will also test the Microsoft
technology.
Previously, Rogers Cable-systems, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone and SBC
Communications also announced plans to use the Microsoft technology.
Hewlett-Packard, the second largest US computer company, and NEC of Japan,
are to develop set-top boxes that will be used to link TV sets to
interactive serv-ices using Microsoft software.
They join General Instrument, the leading maker of cable-TV converter boxes,
in supporting Microsoft technology.
NEC will also build 'media servers' for video on demand services. Intel and
Compaq Computer have previously announced their intention to build servers
compatible with the Microsoft software.
Several systems integrators including Alcatel, Andersen Consulting, Lockheed
Missiles &amp; Space, NTT Data Communications Systems and Olivetti have
committed to provide service and support for testing and global deployment
of the Microsoft technology,
'Microsoft is pleased to be working with a broad range of telecommunications
leaders as we complete the design of our system; together we can build a
basis for the evolving information society,' said Mr Craig Mundie,
vice-president of the advanced consumer technology division at Microsoft.
Microsoft said it would publish details of interfaces needed to make use of
its software, and offer the development tools necessary for other developers
to create services, applications and multimedia content for interactive TV.
'Our strategy is to develop a deployable system, where the engineering work
is complete, and then test it at every increasing scale in order to get it
to commercial operation,' said Ms Laura Jennings, senior director of the
advanced consumer technology division at Microsoft.

The widely-reported collaboration between Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software company, and Sega, the Japanese video game manufacturer,
now appears unlikely to create a significant role for Microsoft in video
game software.
A senior Sega USA official said that Microsoft, contrary to earlier reports,
was not developing an operating system for Saturn, the next-generation Sega
video game machine. Such reports led many industry observers to conclude
that Microsoft aimed to establish worldwide software standards in the video
game arena, just as it has in personal computer software.
However, Mr Steven Payne, director of marketing for Sega USA, the US
subsidiary of Sega responsible for the project, said that the software being
developed with Microsoft for Saturn, a high-performance video game system
under development by Sega, is not expected to include a 'fully-fledged
operating system'.
Microsoft officials said that they were precluded from discussing the
company's relationship with Sega by a non- disclosure agreement. However,
they played down the strategic significance of the relationship, noting that
Microsoft has focused and will continue to focus primarily on PC software.
'Our relationship with Microsoft is evolving and it would be premature to
say exactly what it will involve,' said Mr Payne. However, he noted that
current generation video game machines do not have an operating system;
instead, video game software developers write code that directly addresses
the microprocessor in a video game machine.
Saturn, an advanced video game machine under development by Sega, is
expected to incorporate a CD-ROM drive as well as the familiar game
cartridges. Microsoft's involvement is understood to involve a software
interface to the CD-ROM drive.

<HL> Microsoft Will Sell
Reference Library
On a Compact Disk
---
Software Concern Is Hoping
To Set Industry Standard
For Mass Storage Medium

<TEXT>
   Microsoft Corp. said it will begin selling in June a library of 10 reference works stored on a single compact optical disk similar to those used for high-fidelity sound recordings. 

   Called the Bookshelf, the information source is Microsoft's first general-purpose product using compact disks as a data storage medium for personal computers. 
It also marks Microsoft's effort to establish a software standard for other software companies and publishers of encyclopedias, dictionaries and other reference works to follow in bringing more compact disk-based information to the personal computer market. 

   The Bookshelf, to be priced at $295, will include the entire American Heritage Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, the 1987 World Almanac, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, a U.S. zip code directory and several other reference works for writers. 

   Microsoft also will include a program necessary for a personal computer equipped with a compact disk read-only memory, or CD-ROM drive, to search the disk. 
The program, if successful, would become a standard for using CD-ROM-based data, much as Microsoft's operating system software is now the standard for International Business Machines Corp. personal computers and the legions of compatibles. 

   "Part of Bookshelf's appeal is that it will work with any of 14 word-processing programs" on IBM or compatible personal computers, said Thomas Lopez, vice president of Microsoft's compact disk division. 
According to Mr. Lopez, computer users will be able to retrieve text data from the compact disk and insert it directly into documents being prepared with a word-processing program. 

   Lotus Development Corp., Cambridge, Mass., a rival maker of personal computer software, already has begun selling its first compact disk product. 
Called One Source, it consists of financial information on a disk that is updated weekly, unlike the more long-lived information on Microsoft's disks. 
Depending on the number of data-bases that a customer wants, Lotus charges from $11,000 to $27,000 a year. 
Information from a One Source disk can be loaded from a compact disk player into a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet on a personal computer. 

   Several manufacturers make CD-ROM drives, but only recently have they become widely available, at a cost of $750 and up. 
Microsoft said the Amdek Corp. unit of Wyse Technology, San Jose, Calif., agreed to include a copy of Bookshelf with its Laserdrive I CD-ROM drive for $1,099. 
The drives, which are very similar to compact disk audio players, use a tiny laser to read data encoded in microscopic pits etched inside a spinning plastic disk. 
Bookshelf disks contain only text material, but eventually the optical disks will contain text, video, photos and sound on the same platter. 

   "It sure will make plagiarizing that much easier," said David B. Readerman, a securities analyst who follows Microsoft for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York, referring to the vast amounts of literature that CD-ROM technology could place at students' fingertips. 
"Clearly Microsoft knows the importance of setting software standards for a new storage medium. 
If you can be out there with what essentially becomes an industry standard, you can establish a golden franchise, as Microsoft itself did with its DOS operating system for IBM personal computers." 

   "We're trying to demonstrate a very practical use of a technology that we think will appeal to a broad cross-section of personal computer users," said Microsoft's Mr. Lopez. 

   Mr. Lopez said the company didn't know how many copies of Bookshelf it would sell this year, mainly because "this is a chicken and egg process. 
You have to have the drives out there to sell the software and you have to have the software to sell drives." 

   "I don't think they'll show any profits from this for a few years," said Rick Sherlund, a software industry analyst for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. "Microsoft is just trying to get the industry off on the right foot," Mr. Sherlund said. 

   In the six months ended Dec. 31, Microsoft had profit of $35.5 million, or $1.28 a share, on revenue of $147.8 million.

   Microsoft Corp. confirmed that it plans to build its
future operating software for personal computers around its
Windows program, but it denied that it will completely drop
OS/2, an alternative program it is developing.
   The disclosure followed a report in The Wall Street
Journal that said Microsoft was, in effect, abandoning OS/2
and putting Windows in its place.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an interview yesterday, Steve Ballmer, who runs
Microsoft's system software division, said that the company
plans to keep on marketing products under the OS/2 moniker,
and that its future operating systems will support programs
tailored to OS/2's original specifications. But programs
written for Windows won't run on International Business
Machine Corp.'s version of OS/2, which uses a command system
called Presentation Manager. This divergence strikes many
observers as an abandonment of future OS/2 development,
further distancing Microsoft from IBM.
   But Mr. Ballmer emphasized that Windows software would
work with future versions of OS/2 relying on Presentation
Manager. "It's a bit of a chameleon," said Mr. Ballmer,
referring to future versions.
   Microsoft may be pledging to market OS/2 so as not to hurt
IBM's investment. "Microsoft is under enormous pressure to
rationalize {their message} from an industry standpoint,"
said Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
"They don't want to do disproportionate harm to IBM in the
process."
   Four years ago, Microsoft and IBM jointly announced that
they would produce a new program to replace the function
performed by DOS, which controls the basic operations of the
PC. The two companies, which had worked together to establish
DOS as a standard, called the new program OS/2 and told
makers of applications to design their OS/2 products around a
set of specifications called Presentation Manager.
   But OS/2 never caught on with customers. Instead, Windows
won the hearts of customers, who are pressing Microsoft for
an iron-clad assurance that today's Windows' applications
will work with the company's future operating system.
   Mr. Ballmer acknowledged that Microsoft's future operating
system is no longer solely made up of OS/2 and Presentation
Manager, but will include "subsystems" that make it
impossible for customers to tell it apart from Windows. He
also confirmed that recently he has told designers of new
applications to "target new development at {the} Windows"
subsystem.
   However, under Microsoft's revised approach, operating
systems are like invisible sentries, maintaining the basic
operations of a computer with little apparent trace. "From
the developers and users standpoint, then, the operating
system is irrelevant," Mr. Rogers, the analyst, said. "It's
Windows where everyone has the assets. Microsoft does too."

   Microsoft Corp. said 3Com Corp. agreed to help develop and market its new software for personal computers linked into networks. 

   The pact is considered an effort to establish industry software standards for tying together networks of personal computers using Microsoft's operating system software. 

   Microsoft said 3Com will help develop further features for the Microsoft OS/2 LAN Manager software as well as sell it through its dealers. 3Com, based in Santa Clara, Calif., makes equipment, including personal computers, for use in the networks, which enable users to share common data and programs. 

   Microsoft, in conjunction with International Business Machines Corp., is developing OS/2, an operating system for IBM's newest generation of personal computers. 
OS/2 is scheduled to be available to computer users sometime in 1988. 

   Separately, 3Com reported that profit for the fourth quarter ended May 31 rose 50% to $3.2 million, or 20 cents a share, from $2.1 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 63% to $31.6 million from $19.3 million. 

   For the year, net income was $11.1 million, or 76 cents a share, up 66% from $6.7 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales rose 72% to $110.4 million from $64 million. 
Per-share net income reflects 12% more shares outstanding for the quarter and 5% for the year. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, 3Com closed at $19 a share, down 87.5 cents.

<TEXT>
International Business Machines, Apple Computer and Motorola yesterday
confirmed details of an agreement to develop a common standard specification
for personal computers.
Based on PowerPC microprocessor chips, their goal is to establish a new PC
standard, challenging the domination of Microsoft's Windows and Intel's
microprocessors which are used in about 85 per cent of PCs sold.
Industry analysts said, however, that the move may be 'too little, too late'
because while the PowerPC partners have established a hardware standard,
they have failed to agree on an operating system software standard.
Instead, the companies said they would build computers that adhere to a new
'hardware reference platform' specification that will run a broad range of
software.
The standard PowerPC design will support several operating systems including
Apple's Macintosh software, IBM's OS/2 and AIX (a variety of UNIX) and
Microsoft's Windows NT, the companies said. Novell and Sun Microsystems will
also develop versions of their operating systems for the new PowerPC
standard.
The PowerPC alliance, formed three years ago, has so far been thwarted in
its efforts to unseat Intel and Microsoft by a lack of support from software
companies, which have put most of their resources into developing
application programs for Intel-Microsoft standard PCs.
By establishing a PowerPC hardware standard, the companies hope to broaden
the market, drawing software support and encouraging other computer
companies to build compliant products.
However, the market for software for PowerPC computers will remain
fragmented among the various operating systems, analysts pointed out.
Computers based on the new PowerPC hardware standard will not reach the
market until 1996. In the meantime, Apple, IBM, Motorola and other computer
companies that have been developing PowerPC-based PCs will have to redesign
their products.
Mr Michael Spindler, Apple president and chief executive, said that the new
hardware standard will enable Apple to broaden its sales.

Rogers Cablesystems, Canada's biggest cable-TV operator, is to co-operate
with Microsoft to install the US software group's new interactive television
software, known as Tiger.
Tiger is one of several competing software systems being developed, which
will deliver video-on-demand, shopping, education and other services to
cable-TV subscribers.
Rogers has signed a letter of intent to license the Tiger system, and take
part in early testing of Microsoft's operating system for interactive
broadband cable networks. TCI, the biggest US cable-TV operator, has signed
a similar deal with Microsoft.
Rogers said it was attracted to the Microsoft system by its open
architecture and cost. Microsoft claims Tiger can deliver interactive
programming for about a tenth of the cost of rival technologies.
The system is based on personal-computer technology rather than mainframes.
Microsoft's rivals doubt whether PC-type hardware can provide the
communications and processing power for a network of cable-TV subscribers.

Microsoft and Tele-Communications (TCI) have agreed to test interactive
cable television technology jointly in Seattle, Washington. The tests could
establish software standards for TCI's networks which reach more than 10m
cable television customers throughout the US.
The agreement is the first move into interactive television by Microsoft,
the world's largest computer software company, and the first deployment of
'information superhighway' technology by TCI, the largest US cable
television company.
The companies said that the I-TV trials will occur in two phases. Starting
in the fourth quarter of 1994, the companies will test the technology by
delivering services to 'a few hundred' TCI and Microsoft employees in and
around Seattle, close to Microsoft's headquarters. Next year, the trial will
be expanded to include 'tens of thousands' of TCI cable television customers
in the Seattle area.
'We are taking a deliberate, considered approach by making a long-term
investment in the development of system software that can actually be
deployed to deliver interactive television and broadband networks,' said Mr
Bill Gates, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft.
'These tests represent our first step in the process of developing and
deploying actual equipment and software in our networks to build the
information superhighway,' said Mr John Malone, TCI's president and chief
executive.
'We will be working together with Microsoft to refine the technology and to
learn what our customers want from interactive television - what types of
services they prefer, how they use them, and what features they find
helpful.'
Last month TCI called off its planned merger with Bell Atlantic, a regional
telephone company, and said it would suspend Dollars 500m, or half its
planned spending this year, on upgrading cable television networks. The
announcement of the I-TV trial demonstrates, however, that TCI is moving
ahead with plans for deployment of advanced technology.

   The much ballyhooed operating system for high-performance personal computers, OS/2, is finally going to get some meat on its bones. 

   When Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. began selling a skeletal version of OS/2 in December, so many important parts were missing that there has been little reason to buy it, much less use it. 

   But that's about to change. 
Today, 3Com Corp. will launch personal-computer networking software that will enable a personal computer equipped with OS/2 to coordinate a network of dozens of personal computers. 
And Microsoft will finally crank up its campaign to sell OS/2. 

   "We couldn't really push customers to buy OS/2 before now because you couldn't do much with it," concedes Steven Ballmer, vice president of systems software for Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash. 
"Now there are enough pieces of OS/2 in place to justify buying it -- at least to put it on a network file server." 

   A file server is the coordinating computer in a network; among many other tasks, it hands out data to the other computers, called clients, in the network. 

   3Com's new networking software, 3+Open, is based on special software called LAN Manager that was designed by Microsoft to help OS/2 establish a standard way for IBM-compatible computers to control and participate in networks, and connect to larger computers. 
Such a standard would extend Microsoft's influence over personal computers through its MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems, which control the internal functions of nearly 20 million personal computers. 

   More than 30 software and computer companies have said they will incorporate LAN Manager into networking products. 3Com, a maker of networking equipment and personal computers based in San Jose, Calif., is the first to ship a product. 
Others endorsing it are Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Corp. and IBM. 

   "One of OS/2's most important features is multi-tasking," or handling several computing tasks at once, says William Krause, chairman and chief executive of 3Com. 
"And the fundamental requirement for a network file server is multi-tasking: to serve many clients with printing and file services, access to data, electronic mail, gateways into larger computers, all at the same time." 

   3+Open will cost $995 for each group of five computers being served by a central file server that uses the software. 
And for $2,995, a customer can hook up an unlimited number of so-called "client" personal computers on the network. 3Com's sales force, as well as computer dealers such as Businessland Inc. will sell the software. 

   Egghead Inc., which previously didn't sell networking software, said it would market 3+Open. 
And customers can contract with Hewlett-Packard for service and technical support, 3Com says. 

   LAN Manager-based products like 3+Open will be competing in a big and fast-growing market. 
This year, for example, market researchers estimate that customers will spend over $2.5 billion on networks of personal computers, a figure that should swell to over $4 billion by 1990. 

   Dozens of companies sell networking equipment and software. 
Currently, Novell Corp. of Provo, Utah, dominates the business of supplying software for linking networks of personal computers, and 3Com leads markets for adapters, cable systems, connections and other network hardware. 

   So far, Novell hasn't announced plans to develop a LAN Manager-based product. 
Novell's big-selling Netware acts as a separate operating system displacing MS-DOS or OS/2 on a central file-server. 
Netware handles network communication chores and provides some multi-tasking. 
But, says John McCarthy, research director for Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., "Netware is basically a traffic cop, providing little more than simple printer and file sharing, and can't participate directly in running applications." 

   On the other hand, LAN Manager-based networks, because they are extensions of the same operating system that controls client personal computers, can lend a helping hand in running programs. "3+Open and other LAN Manager-based networks can give a tired old machine that runs the old MS-DOS operating system a mid-life kicker by taking over some of the processing," says Mr. Krause. 
He uses the example of sending a big spreadsheet back to the LAN Manager server to recalculate in a few minutes what an older IBM would take 20 minutes to refigure. 

   Other analysts, however, believe that LAN Manager-based networks, just like OS/2, don't offer computer users any immediate advantages over Netware or other existing networking programs, namely because there aren't any specific programs such as databases, accounting systems or electronic mail systems designed to tap LAN Manager's full power yet. 

   "People don't buy networking by itself," says Stewart Alsop, an industry analyst and consultant who publishes PC Letter. 
"People buy what networking allows them to do -- communicate, share programs and work on the same data." 
While Mr. Alsop concedes that 3+Open and other LAN Manager-based products will make it harder for Novell to dominate, "LAN Manager won't really catch on until somebody writes programs specifically designed for networks of OS/2 computers." 

   Initially, LAN Manager-based networks will coordinate client computers that use the older MS-DOS operating system. 
Only when programs tapping the full power of OS/2 arrive will it make sense to run OS/2 on the client personal computers. 
Accordingly, only then will LAN Manager itself really show what it can do. 

   And that won't be for a while, because OS/2 is still missing a few pieces. 
What everybody is waiting for is a component of OS/2 to be delivered by Halloween called Presentation Manager that will handle onscreen graphics and the way users interact with programs. 
Even after Presentation Manager arrives, it will take software developers another six months or so to finish up spreadsheets, databases, word processors and other programs that take full advantage of OS/2. 
Microsoft cautions that it won't be until at least 1991 that most IBM-compatible PCs will be using it. 

   Still, Microsoft officials are excited now that LAN manager products are available, to finally be able to look forward to generating some revenue from the company's big investment of both time and money in OS/2, even if it is only from sales of OS/2 for network file servers. 

   "This finally gets the ball rolling," says Microsoft's Mr. Ballmer.

FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: IBM and Microsoft settle PC
software dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM and Microsoft have reached an agreement on software licensing and patent
royalties that resolves a long-running dispute over personal computer
operating system software.
The agreement between IBM and Microsoft has been dubbed a 'divorce
settlement' because it ends almost two years of acrimony which began when
the companies chose different paths towards the development of a new
generation of PC software.
IBM and Microsoft had worked closely together since IBM chose Microsoft's
'DOS' program for its original PC 12 years ago. The companies went on to
collaborate in the development of a new operating system, called OS/2.
However, the first version was a flop and Microsoft chose to pursue
development of its own 'Windows' program while eventually dropping its
efforts to improve OS/2.
Windows has since become become a huge success, with sales of over 10m
copies. IBM, which continued work on OS/2 alone, recently launched a much
improved version of the operating system which, according to IBM, is selling
strongly although in smaller numbers.
Microsoft is expected to launch a new version of Windows, Windows Net
Technology, later this year, that will compete head-on with IBM's OS/2.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chief executive, has been scathing in his criticism
of IBM, while IBM executives, although more restrained, have been unable to
hide their annoyance over the embarrassing split.
The companies have now agreed to license each other to use IBM's OS/2 and
Microsoft's Windows programs until the end of 1993. The companies have also
entered into a long-term patent licensing agreement.
Other terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but Microsoft is believed
to be paying IBM about Dollars 20m for rights to the computer giant's
extensive patent portfolio, which includes basic software technology.
Microsoft is the first large software company to reach a patent
cross-licence agreement with IBM, raising the prospect that IBM may seek
fees from other software publishers.
The battle between Microsoft and IBM has caused confusion among PC buyers
and throughout the PC software industry, so the resolution of the dispute
will benefit all, the companies claimed.
'With these agreements behind us, we will both be free to continue with our
individual business strategies to meet our customers' needs,' said Mr Lee
Reiswig Jr, the IBM executive in charge of personal computer software.
Mr Bernard Pache, the new chief executive of Groupe Bull, the loss-making
French computer manufacturer, yesterday confirmed the company's strategic
alliance with IBM. The US group is paying FFr540m (Dollars 7.51m), or FFr48
a share, for a 5.68 per cent stake in Bull.

FT  22 APR 91 / Target for discontent: Microsoft has become a focus for
industry ire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Microsoft's popular 'Windows' program received a 'Best New Business
Software Product' award at a recent computer software industry event in San
Francisco, the audience of industry executives booed and hissed.
This outburst of public animosity reflects rising resentment towards
Microsoft among its competitors and even some of its partners in the
personal computer industry, who charge that the company is using 'bully
tactics' to expand its dominant position in the market for personal computer
programs.
Industry grumbles have now come to the attention of the US Federal Trade
Commission which has told Microsoft that it is conducting a broad anti-trust
investigation into 'third-party allegations that the company has monopolised
or has attempted to monopolise the market for operating systems, operating
environments, computer software and computer peripherals for personal
computers'.
'I don't believe we are doing anything illegal or unethical,' insists Mr
Mike Hallman, Microsoft president. The commission has not raised any
specific charges, he says, adding that envy of Microsoft's success is behind
much of the criticism. Industry observers agree that there are a lot of
'sour grapes' among those who wish that they could have matched Microsoft's
performance. Certainly, as the world's largest and most profitable computer
software company, Microsoft makes an easy target.
With 1990 revenues of Dollars 1.18bn, Microsoft dominates the market for
programs that run on personal computers. Already for the first three
quarters of fiscal 1991, Microsoft has reported revenues of Dollars 1.3bn.
The company is widely acclaimed as one of the best-managed computer groups,
and PC users clearly have benefited from its dozens of products.
Yet within the computer industry, Microsoft has become the company that
competitors love to hate. Mr Bill Gates, its chairman and founder, receives
much of the blame. At 35, he is an entrepreneurial legend, a self-made
multi-billionaire. Intensely competitive, Mr Gates 'always plays to win '
and to leave the other guy knowing that he has lost', says a long-time
business associate.
Founded in 1975, Microsoft rose to power in the early 1980s as the developer
of MS-DOS, the 'operating system' program that controls the basic functions
 -such as retrieving or saving data - of IBM-compatible personal computers.
Since then, the company has played a pivotal role in the personal computer
industry, in part because of its ties to IBM.
Microsoft has expanded its hold on the systems software market with programs
such as OS/2, a more powerful PC operating system, and 'Windows', which
gives IBM-compatible computers many of the attributes of an Apple Computer's
Macintosh.
But the company has also established itself as the premier supplier of
applications programs - such as word processors and spread sheets - for
Macintosh and as a challenger to market leaders in two of the main segments
of the market for IBM-compatible applications programs.
As Microsoft has grown, so has its power to influence the industry,
particularly in the areas of standards and the direction of technology. But
this power has also bred resentment.
Microsoft 'is like a tall teenager who has yet to achieve the maturity that
goes with his stature', says Mr Dick Williams, president of Digital
Research, a long-time Microsoft competitor. Aggressive sales tactics may
have been acceptable when Microsoft was a 'small, scrappy company', he
suggests, but today 'they have an extremely adverse impact upon all other
players in the industry'.
Even IBM, long Microsoft's closest partner, appears to be distancing itself
from the software company. Last week IBM held a series of seminars to lay
out its future PC operating system strategy. Microsoft played no part in the
presentations.
The long-time allies now acknowledge differences of opinion over the
direction of PC software. While Microsoft is promoting its 'Windows'
program, in combination with DOS, as the operating software of choice for
most PC users, IBM is firmly committed to a new generation of software based
upon OS/2, an operating system that the two companies developed together.
Since Microsoft has an interest in both programs this might appear to be an
'in-house' squabble, but in reality its outcome could determine whether
Microsoft takes control of PC software standards, or cedes that role to IBM.
'IBM intends to deliver OS/2 2.0 . . . that will provide a better DOS than
DOS and a better 'Windows' than 'Windows,'' says Mr James Cannavino, IBM
vice-president in charge of personal computer operations.
In another move that has raised questions about the Microsoft-IBM
'marriage', IBM has recently been licensing PC software from several
Microsoft competitors.
Microsoft's relationships with some other key players in the personal
computer industry are also strained; for instance, the software company is
in the middle of a legal fight with Apple Computer over alleged copyright
infringement of Macintosh software. Hewlett-Packard, the leading supplier of
desk-top computer printers, is also antagonistic. 'Microsoft cares more
about winning than relationships,' charges Mr Doug Carnahan, general manager
of the printing systems group at HP.
Microsoft's strategic relationships last only as long as the company sees an
immediate benefit, according to other industry executives. Its loudest
critics are, however, among its competitors in the market for personal
computer applications programs. They take a dim view of Microsoft's dual
role as both a systems software and applications programs developer.
Critics charge that Microsoft's in-house applications program developers
acquire advanced knowledge of future changes in operating systems and
related software, giving them an unfair advantage over outside competitors.
The company can beat competitors to market with applications programs that
take advantage of new features of the operating systems developed in-house,
competitors complain. Yet even if Microsoft's applications developers do
benefit from advance information about systems software, the company is not
doing anything illegal.
'Microsoft is not unique in developing both systems software and
applications,' Mr Hallman protests. 'IBM, HP, Digital Equipment and Apple do
it too.' Microsoft is, however, the only sizeable PC software company that
straddles both sides of the software market.
'We treat our applications division just like any other software developer,'
adds Mr Hallman. Microsoft holds regular developers' conferences to share
its plans with outside applications programmers, and has a senior executive
in charge of 'developer relations', he points out.
This has not dimmed the dislike of Microsoft among dozens of smaller PC
software companies. Those that attempt to compete head on in the PC
operating systems market claim that the market leader uses 'tie-in pricing',
linking purchases of its applications programs to prices for its operating
systems programs.
Others make claims of being drawn into sharing their product secrets with
Microsoft in licensing or acquisition talks, only to see Microsoft launch a
competing product after the talks have broken down.
To allegations that Microsoft has exploited smaller companies, Mr Hallman
responds that it is difficult to address 'non-specific' charges. 'But we
have a very clear set of guidelines on business practices. We have to deal
with other companies without exploiting those contacts.'
The FTC investigation into Microsoft's business practices could go on for
months, even years, and may lead nowhere. Legal experts say that no evidence
has emerged to suggest that Microsoft is in violation of anti-trust laws. In
the meantime, however, Microsoft may be forced to confront its lack of
popularity in an industry where inter-company relationships are crucial.
'One lesson we have learned,' Mr Hallman acknowledges, 'is that we need to
make sure that we communicate fully with all our partners.'
Another lesson may be that Microsoft must temper its marketing tactics while
it is under the scrutiny of federal regulators. Though it is a midget in the
computer industry as a whole, in the personal computer software industry
Microsoft is a giant. It cannot throw its weight around without being
labelled a bully.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Technology: Breaking windows - IBM is taking on the might of
Microsoft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines aims to 'shatter Windows' with the launch
next week (October 11) of Warp, a completely overhauled version of OS/2, its
personal computer operating system software.
Microsoft's Windows dominates the world market for PC operating systems  -
the software that controls the basic functions of a computer. An estimated
60m PCs have Windows installed, while IBM's OS/2 comes a distant second with
about 6m copies in use.
Warp may, however, prove to be a potent challenger to the Microsoft industry
standard. 'There is no question, Warp is technologically superior to
Windows,' says Karl Wong, of Dataquest, a US market research firm.
While the current versions of Windows are 16-bit operating systems - they
process data in 16-bit chunks - OS/2 is a 32-bit operating system that can
take full advantage of the power of the latest microprocessors, he points
out. For PC users, this means applications will run faster, fetching data
from a disk drive will take fewer seconds, and video on a PC screen will be
sharper.
Another advantage of Warp is that it will fit comfortably into 4MB of
memory, the standard configuration of most PCs sold today, says Wong.
With the introduction of Warp, IBM is seizing a rare opportunity to try to
upstage the software market leader. Microsoft was to have launched a 32-bit
version of Windows, popularly known as by its code name Chicago, towards the
end of last year but the launch has been repeatedly postponed and the
company now says that the software, renamed Windows 95, will not appear
until early next year.
'Arrive in Chicago earlier than expected,' say IBM advertisements for OS/2.
'There is no need to wait in a holding pattern for a 32-bit operating
system.' IBM's wisecracks may raise some laughs among computer buffs, but
the biggest challenge facing Big Blue as it tries to break the Windows hold
on the PC market is that familiarity may have more appeal to the average PC
user than technological superiority.
An April survey of 10,500 PC users conducted by Computer Intelligence
Infocorp, a market research group, found that 23 per cent had never heard of
OS/2, although the first version was introduced seven years ago. Only 4 per
cent did not know of Microsoft's Windows.
IBM plans a Dollars 50m (Pounds 31.6m) advertising campaign for OS/2 over
the next three months, and the company is using many of its senior
executives to seek converts to the product worldwide. Still, operating
system software is a hard sell.
In an attempt to give Warp broader appeal, IBM is packaging the new version
of OS/2 with a bundle of applications designed to lure new customers.
Topping the list is a set of programs that will give instant access to the
Internet, the global computer network.
'The information superhighway is the hottest topic among PC users today, yet
many people really have no idea what it is or how to get on it,' says Wally
Casey, IBM personal software products director of marketing. There are a
million new users logging on to the Internet every month, but about 400,000
give up because it is too hard to use, he says.
IBM plans to tap into the excitement surrounding the Internet by providing
easy-to-use software for a wide range of Internet software. The package will
turn the average PC user into a fully-fledged 'Net surfer'.
'We aim to make OS/2 synonymous with the information superhighway,' says
Casey. Warp users will get immediate access to the Internet via the Advantis
network in the US and other IBM networks worldwide. After 10 free hours of
access, 40 hours of use a month will cost about Dollars 25.
'The IBM information highway will have 'on-ramps' (local access) available
in major metropolitan centres worldwide,' says Casey. IBM already has
telephone lines established in 11 countries to handle the 10m users it
counts on signing up in the next year.
Building on another market trend, IBM will include multimedia software that
enables users of PCs with the relevant add-on circuit boards to watch TV on
the PC screen, host a video conference, or display photographs stored on
disk using Kodak's new PhotoCD technology. For less ambitious PC users, a
suite of office applications is included with Warp as well as some games.
The US list price for Warp is expected to be Dollars 80, but retail
discounts will probably bring it below Dollars 50. And existing OS/2 users
can expect to get an upgrade for Dollars 25 or less. Microsoft's Chicago is
also expected to come packed with extra programs, including Internet
software, although the company has yet to provide details or prices.
OS/2 still faces tough hurdles. The biggest may be the wide perception that
there are few third-party applications such as games and office programs to
run on the IBM operating system. Finding OS/2 applications is usually a
challenge.
Although OS/2 can run applications designed for Windows and MS-Dos, IBM
wants to encourage third-party software developers to create 'native' OS/2
programs and will pay retailers to set aside shelf space for OS/2 programs.
Most PC buyers, however, are unlikely to replace the Windows operating
system software that comes on almost every new PC. Part of IBM's attack is
therefore aimed at PC manufacturers. Microsoft's recent antitrust consent
decree, which forces the company to offer new terms to PC manufacturers that
pre-install Windows software on their products, may give IBM the opening it
needs. 'We are prepared to win this battle by selling software packages one
at a time, but we hope to get it pre-loaded before people buy their PCs,'
says Casey.
Yet few PC makers appear willing to risk switching from the popular
Microsoft software: only CompuAdd, a small US PC company, has announced
plans to install Warp on its PCs.
IBM is expected, however, to announce next week that its own PC division
will put its weight behind OS/2 by loading the software on to its products
along with a copy of Microsoft Windows. This will be the acid test for Warp.
Faced with the option to boot up Windows or Warp, which one will PC users
choose?

MICROSOFT said yesterday it would launch a new version of its widely-used
Windows personal computer program next month and expects to sell 1m copies
within 30 days.
The announcement appears designed to pre-empt International Business
Machines' expected introduction, later this month, of a competing operating
system for personal computers.
The former partners are gearing up for a marketing battle. Microsoft will
for the first time use television advertising to promote Windows. IBM is
also planning a publicity blitz.
Price competition is also expected to be fierce, with Microsoft offering a
Windows upgrade package to current users for Dollars 50. At issue is control
over the direction of personal computer software.
Windows provides personal computer users with a graphical interface, similar
to the Apple Macintosh, replacing typed commands with a 'point and click'
method of selecting applications and functions.
Windows works in conjunction with Microsoft DOS, the operating system used
on about 90 per cent of personal computers.
The new update to Windows, called Windows 3.1, includes enhancements that
make it faster, easier to use and more robust than previous versions,
Microsoft said.
More than 9m copies of Windows 3.0, the current version, have sold since its
introduction in June 1990.
Shipments of Windows 3.1 will coincide with IBM's introduction of OS/2 , a
competing personal computer operating system.
Originally, Microsoft and IBM co-operated in the development of OS/2, but
parted ways after a dispute over the direction of future personal computer
operating system software.
IBM chose to promote OS/2 as a replacement for Microsoft's DOS and Windows.
Microsoft has focused on enhancing Windows.
IBM aims to break Microsoft's domination of the market with OS/2.

'Evolutionary rather than revolutionary' - Multimedia in the office / Bill

multimedia trials in the US and Europe, reports Alan Cane. Microsoft is
meanwhile investing Dollars 100m a year in multimedia and aims to set the
agenda in the technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, is
harnessing its resources to a new goal: leadership in the design of
multimedia systems.
It is already investing over Dollars 100m a year - out of an research and
development budget of Dollars 473m - on the critical operating software. Mr
Bill Gates, the company's founder and chairman, said earlier this month that
the company had more people working on multimedia than any other software
group.
The implication is that the company wants to establish its software as the
global standard in multimedia just as its MS/DOS and Windows operating
systems are the world standard for IBM's design of personal computers.
There have been some early clues: Microsoft is already working with Sega,
the Japanese games console manufacturer, on an operating system for a new
machine, although Mr Gates says the project is small and divorced from
Microsoft's mainline operating systems development.
Some weeks ago, it bought Soft Image, a Canadian company which is market
leader in the esoteric discipline of software for moving picture animation.
The special effects in the film Jurassic Park are its work.
Furthermore, it has announced it intends to test its multimedia software in
collaboration with Tele-Communications Inc.,( TCI), the largest US cable
operator. A first fruit from the venture will be a new channel of
programming aimed at the consumer market for computer hardware, software and
accessories.
What Microsoft intends to provide is the operating software which will
manage the flow of information of all kinds on to high speed networks and
the software which will connect it to personal computer operating systems in
the home or office. It may also provide some of the applications - a
personal money management program, for example.
Mr Gates says 'there are a lot of companies developing software for the
'information highway,' just as there were a lot of companies involved in
operating systems at the beginning of the personal computer business.
Everybody who is doing multimedia software will have lots of pilots. Based
on the quality of those pilots, some will emerge stronger than others'.
Mr Gates said Microsoft would begin testing home multimedia services in the
US and Europe in 1995. He did not expect substantial returns on his
investment for five years, although he thought that there would be
substantive developments in multimedia in 1996-97 with entire cities
converted to interactive networks.
Multimedia and the 'information superhighway,' the high-capacity network
which will link vast repositories of information with modified television
sets or personal computers, are creating intense interest among computer
companies, telecommunications organisations and entertainment firms. They
are jockeying to take advantage of what are expected to be lucrative new
business opportunities.
Bill Gates, however, argues that most are taking the wrong approach - 'dead
ends' were how he described them - 'because the user-interface is so simple,
and because they do not tie in to personal computers in the right way, the
results will be disappointing. The revenue and the usage that comes out of
them will not justify the huge infrastructure costs.'
most of the trials to date have been designed to exploit domestic
multimedia, offering, typically, menus of video films for home viewing, Mr
Gates says that business will make use of the multimedia first.
'The first widespread use of these capabilities will be in business,' he
predicted. 'It will involve things like video-conferencing and collaboration
which would enable you to do your job without going into the office. Or it
could help companies find expertise to help them out without the expert
having to travel.
'The network itself could create electronic markets able to find a resource
of any type.'
'So, what in the past we have seen as electronic markets for currencies or
stocks will move into items of all types where chequeing references and
other kinds of working together can be done very effectively in electronic
form.'
'This will be done by extending the range of the personal computer. One of
the early symptoms will be very low cost video conferencing where a PC is
connected up to an ISDN (integrated services digital network). Within two or
three years this will be extremely widespread.
(Intel, which makes the microprocessors used in the majority of the world's
personal computers, earlier this year announced a low-cost set of components
capable of turning a personal computer into a video-conferencing terminal).
Mr Gates thought that multimedia in the office would be evolutionary rather
than revolutionary, driven by proven technologies like electronic mail -
'the benefits of electronic mail are unbelievable. We could not run
Microsoft without that capability.
'Today, some think of electronic mail and work group software and the
Internet (an open, publicly available computer network spanning several
continents) as separate things, but with some enhancements to Windows due in
less than a year, we will bring all these things together.'
Once the technology and benefits have been established in a business
environment, that would be the time to move into the home.
Mr Gates was critical of the narrow range of many of the current multimedia
trials: 'Some of the early pilots will be particularly embarrassing because
they will not have the breadth of applications,' he said.
'The network operators running these pilots are acting against their own
interests because they are going to prove exactly what they do not want to
prove - that there will not be enough revenue generated to justify building
the infrastructure.'
'Until you have a broad range of applications, you will never be able to
demonstrate the true potential of these systems. That is why instead of
doing crummy pilots in 1994, we will start our trials in 1995.'
He extended his criticism to Oracle, the US database specialist with which
British Telecommunications has formed an alliance to test interactive
entertainment services in the home. Oracle will provide the software and
systems integration: 'I'm sure Oracle will change its approach because it is
a terrible approach,' he said.
Bill Gates' comments have to be seen against a background of intense
competition in the nascent multimedia business. Furthermore, he has never
been slow to promote Microsoft's efforts and pick holes in the competition.

  [Text]NTT and Microsoft are developing delivery services 
for multimedia information. They have begun work on a software 
delivery system that uses compact-disc ROMs (CD ROMs). In 
another venture, NTT Data Communication is working with Softbank 
on setting up a company to deliver video-on-demand. Both 
alliances are efforts by NTT to borrow outside expertise to 
realize the idea of multimedia. 
  NTT announced it formed a joint venture with Microsoft in 
March to begin developing a multimedia information delivery 
service. The joint development by both companies is a basic 
technology for distributing software for personal computers, 
movies, and music over networks. Their goal is to implement a 
new delivery system for multimedia information. 
  NTT had just entered into a joint venture with General Magic 
in January 1994. That makes this the second agreement made with 
a foreign software vendor. NTT's aim is to reflect the powerful 
software technology for terminals onto its network services. 
  Several days after the announcement of the venture between 
NTT and Microsoft, NTT Data Communication and Softbank, the 
giant distributor of PC software, revealed that they will 
bolster NTT's efforts. Both companies will use NTT's 
optical-fiber network and establish a new service-providing 
company for video-on-demand to deliver movies to viewers when 
desired. 
  In the announcement made in January 1994, NTT emphasized the 
need to form bonds with other companies. (See ``The Basic Idea 
of Multimedia,'' Nikkei Communications, 7 February 
1994, pp. 21-23.) Through this dramatic series of alliances, NTT 
stands at the starting line for achieving this idea. 
<H5>  Distributing CD ROM Encrypted Keys </H5>
  Two technologies will be developed with Microsoft. One is a 
delivery system for PC software and movies using CD ROMs. The 
software is encrypted and stored on CD ROMs. The user will pay a 
software licensing fee to receive an encrypted key on line. The 
second technology connects NTT's facsimile communication 
service, F-Net, to Microsoft's software systems for office 
automation, At Work. Neither technology, however, is touted as a 
true multimedia delivery system. 
  Figure 1 illustrates the system configuration of a software 
delivery system using CD ROMs. The user buys inexpensive CD ROMs 
storing encrypted PC software, movies, music, and games. The 
encryption method is based on NTT technology. Encrypted software 
cannot be directly used. The key must be purchased to release 
the code; it is transmitted over the NTT network. NTT will 
collect software usage fees from users. Future studies will 
involve transmitting not only keys, but the software itself.

&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Media Provider; 2. Computer Software; 3. Movies; 
4. Music; 5. (1) CD ROM with encrypted and recorded data; 6. (2)

(4) Pay fee; 9. (5) Commission for fee collection; 10. (6) 
Return of collected fees; 11. User; 12. Personal 
Computer.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Who will supply the CD ROMs? Distributors of PC software are 
among the companies expressing interest. Masayoshi Son, 
president of Softbank, comments that if a new delivery 
infrastructure can be created, his company would aggressively 
use it. According to him, the job of a distributor is to collect 
software and store it on CD ROMs. Softbank is already beginning 
a similar service in the United States. The user places an order 
by telephone, receives the key to release the encryption from an 
operator, and enters it into the personal computer. 
<H5>  Making F-Net Compatible with At Work </H5>
  The objective of connecting F-Net to At Work is to use the 
graphical user interface (GUI) provided by At Work and simplify 
the operation of F-Net. Its implementation is planned for a year 
from now. At that time, the data transmission protocol of At 
Work will be supported by F-Net. 
  The advantage is communication costs are controlled if F-Net 
is used when a large number of facsimiles are broadcast over 
short distances. However, using F-Net is not always convenient, 
for example, registering the broadcast destinations presents 
problems. There are two registration methods. The first sends 
the list of destinations to NTT. Here, registration lasts 
several days. In the second method, the destinations are entered 
on the mark sheet used by NTT, then this sheet is sent by 
facsimile. In this case, registration is immediate, but filling 
in the mark sheet is complicated. This task can be simplified by 
using the facsimiles incorporated into At Work and PCs. 
<H5>  Target: 10 Million Subscribers by 2000 Using NTT Optical </H5>
Fibers 
  The joint venture established in April 1994 by NTT Data 
Communication and Softbank is called Mediabank Enterprises. NTT 
Data Communication's percentage of the investment is 40% 
and 
Softbank's is 60%. Masayoshi Son, Softbank's president, 
is also 
acting as the president of the joint venture. In addition to 
video-on-demand, ticket sales, karaoke, games, telemarketing 
businesses are being planned. 
  Full operation is slated to begin in March 1995. Until then, 
preparation of the rate structure for users and information 
providers and selection of the equipment needed in two-way cable 
and television are proceeding. NTT Data Communication will be in 
charge of the operation of the center's facilities. 
  Son stated a goal of 10 million household subscribers by the 
year 2000 and presented a model plan for a bold rate structure 
(Figure 2). A set-top CATV converter box is loaned free of 
charge. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-34A>      Figure 2. Rate Structure of the Video-on-Demand Service </FIG>

from Mediabank Enterprises. Mediabank Enterprises will change 
its name to Mediabank when it begins operation. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Ordinary Household 2. Circuit Usage Fees 3. Usage 
Fee (Movie) 4. &yen;300/film 5. &yen;1,200/month 6. Basic Fee 7.

11. Mediabank 12. Information Provider (IP) 13. Contract 14. 
Center Usage Fee 15. NTT Data Communication&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  According to Son, NTT's infrastructure will be the maximum 
limit of the network for providing services. As one link in the 
multimedia idea, optical fibers will extend to ordinary 
households who will probably become major users. There are no 
plans at this time to use the cables owned by CATV businesses. 
In 1995 NTT will participate in tests of multimedia services for 
homes. 
  Until the optical-fiber network spreads, business start-ups 
will focus on markets for specific applications, for example, 
delivering movies to hotels, or supplying karaoke and software.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (7): The battle intensifies -
Race to supply new operating systems software - The emerging mid-range
systems market has now become the main battleground for the new strand of
operating system development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER

<TEXT>
Operating systems software occupies a pivotal position in modern computer
systems. Not only does the choice of operating system define the computer
hardware - it also defines the application.
The choice of operating systems platform has, in effect, replaced the choice
of hardware for users.
While in the past, there was always a danger that computer users could
become dependent upon their hardware supplier, over the last decade the
emphasis has shifted to the operating system platform supplier. This has
become increasingly confusing for users and software developers who are
looking for a stable platform on which to build applications.
The result has been a bitter public conflict among operating system
suppliers, each hoping to gain dominance in the market.
This conflict dates back to the mid-1980s when the virtues of common
operating environments were first recognised.
The success of IBM's Personal Computer (PC) along with Microsoft's MS/Dos
created a large, homogeneous software product market for the first time.
Previously, every computer came with its own operating environment - making
it impossible to move application software from one machine to another
without significant changes.
The MS/Dos PC changed this and allowed a new breed of mass market software
developers such as Lotus, Novell and Microsoft to dominate personal computer
software.
Towards the end of the 1980s, these and other software producers saw that
the same approach could be taken to build software for larger systems -
either in the form of PC networks or client-server systems.
The need emerged, therefore, for an operating environment which could
deliver the same advantages as a PC operating system, while coping with the
greater complexity of multi-user systems.
It is this emerging mid-range systems market which has become the main
battleground for the new strand of operating system development. There is no
shortage of contenders. Microsoft is in pole position with the extended
version of its successful Windows-MS/Dos operating system for the PC.
Known as Windows NT, it is claimed to be the natural migration path for
single PC users who want to move into multi-user networked systems.
Microsoft aimed to sell a million copies by the end of its first year and,
while this target has proved to be ambitious, Microsoft has managed to get
close to it. More significantly, sales of the original Windows are now about
50m worldwide and growing quickly. Microsoft's main rival comes from a
combination of Novell and other Microsoft competitors who back various
flavours of the Unix operating system originated by AT&amp;T's Bell laboratories
in the 1970s. Unix has the advantage of a long history of supporting
multiple users and wide backing across the industry.
Most hardware manufacturers offer a Unix platform - although they are not as
consistent as they should be in conforming to the standards. Unix has
managed to gain some success in the mid-range systems market and a good
portfolio of applications software now exists for it.
The other main rival to Windows NT is OS/2 - an operating system developed
originally by both Microsoft and IBM. When it was announced in 1987, it was
designed to replace MS/Dos. But after slow initial success, IBM and
Microsoft went their separate ways - leaving IBM to continue OS/2
development on its own. OS/2 has attracted a solid core of established large
IBM customers because it fits in well with their existing systems.
The OS/2 operating systems has an estimated four million users worldwide -
but has had little success outside the IBM market.
These three - Windows NT, Unix and OS/2 - are the main contenders in the
operating systems conflict and each faction has embarked on a campaign to
attract firstly, application software developers and, secondly, end-user
companies.
The conflict is further confused, however, by the emergence of a new strain
of object-oriented operating systems. Apple's Macintosh, for example, has
attracted attention - although it is limited by its ties to Apple's
hardware.
Apple founder Steve Jobs left to form Next Computer in the late 1980s,
creating yet another potential rival operating environment. Next has built a
version of its Nextstep object-oriented system for the PC and, again, has
scored some success in niche markets.
Another object-oriented environment has grown out of a joint venture between
Apple and IBM under the Taligent name. Taligent promises to improve
development productivity with its operating system - although it will be
some time before it its ready for the market.
The primary task of all of the contenders in the operating system battle is
to woo software package developers. MS/Dos was successful because Microsoft
was able to persuade a large number of application builders to base their
packages on it.
Software developers are sanguine about operating systems, however, and many
have accepted that, unlike the MS/Dos market, they will have to back several
different options.
'We have taken the view that the operating system is irrelevant to the
end-user and are working to hide it,' explains Mr Ketan Karia, director of
marketing at application software tool specialist Cognos UK.
'We aim to make our tools work across a range of operating systems but we
are concentrating on Unix and Windows NT at the moment.' Mr Derek Masters,
managing director of Sterling Software UK, comes at the problem from a
different angle. As a veteran software supplier to the IBM mainframe market,
Mr Masters says his company has been driven by customers moving from
mainframe-based systems to networked systems.
'Three years ago our customers were entirely mainframe based. Now they have
lots of Unix, Windows and OS/2 systems which they want attached to their
mainframes. We have had to change our products to cover the whole range.'
Sterling's products involve managing communications and data storage across
an enterprise and must, therefore, be capable of coping with any operating
environment which might be connected to the network.
'Microsoft is in a strong position with Windows NT - although we find our
traditional customers favour OS/2 because of its IBM background. Then again
we see Unix creeping in - especially in applications which use electronic
data interchange (EDI),' Mr Masters adds.
In theory, users should not have to worry about operating systems and, in
the long term, it seems likely that much of burden caused different
environments will be shouldered by tool builders.
Meanwhile, software developers and users will have to accept that they must
keep an eye on all of the main contenders - and maybe some of the
'also-rans.'

   IBM, Novell
   To Announce
   Marketing Pact

   International Business Machines Corp. and Novell Inc. will
announce tomorrow a marketing agreement that will further
strain IBM's relations with Microsoft Corp., industry
executives said.
   Those relations have come under scrutiny in recent weeks
as IBM and Microsoft -- whose partnership helped provide the
foundation for the personal-computer industry -- have
increasingly headed in different directions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The industry executives said IBM and Novell will announce
that the IBM sales force will resell Novell's Netware
operating system, which controls the flow of traffic on
personal-computer networks. IBM, Armonk, N.Y., declined to
comment. Novell, Provo, Utah, said officials were traveling
over the weekend and couldn't be reached.
   IBM already sells a competing operating system, called LAN
Server, which derives from Microsoft's LAN Manager, so any
shift by IBM customers toward Novell would mark a setback for
Microsoft.
   Microsoft, which dominates the market for personal
computer operating systems, has said it views the network
operating system market as the next great battleground.
Microsoft has talked about beefing up its development efforts
and distribution network to match Novell's -- Microsoft has
said there are more Novell Netware dealers in the U.S. than
there are 7-Elevens, making it easier to buy that operating
system than it is to buy a Slurpie.
   But Microsoft's LAN Manager -- together with such cousins
as IBM's LAN Server -- controlled just 10% of the world-wide
market for network operating systems last year, according to
International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass., a
market-research firm. Novell controlled 53%, IDC said. And to
overtake Novell, Microsoft needs to retain what support it
has among the hardware giants, with their huge sales forces.
   On speculation that Novell would soon announce marketing
agreements with IBM and Digital Equipment Corp., Novell stock
has jumped from $43 at the end of last month; it rose $1.625
Friday to $47.625, a 52-week high, in over-the-counter
trading. Microsoft stock, itself on a furious climb of late,
climbed $1 to $104 in over-the-counter trading. IBM increased
$1 to $129.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The remaining question is just how hard IBM salesmen will
push Netware. IBM will continue to sell the rival LAN Server,
and it remains the industry's biggest supporter of the OS/2
operating system, which provides the basis for LAN Server.
Still, IBM has become more pragmatic about its product
offerings, and customers seem to want Netware more than they
do Microsoft's offering.
   In addition, the industry executives noted that IBM has in
recent months announced a series of agreements with Metaphor
Computer Systems, Go Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc. for
software that IBM in the past might have developed with
Microsoft. Microsoft, for its part, has begun emphasizing the
Windows system-software product that it developed on its own,
even though IBM has pushed it to promote OS/2, which IBM and
Microsoft developed together.

FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (18): Technology
shift - Operating Software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE computer industry is preparing itself for one of its periodic technology
shifts. In the past these shifts were solely the result of fundamental
advances in hardware - the inventions of both the transistor and the
microprocessor are notable examples.
This time, however, the technology shift is the result of a fundamental
change in operating system software - the software which controls what goes
on 'under the covers' and provides the base for applications.
Improvements in user interface software and in telecommunications, and the
novel applications they can deliver, demand much more from operating systems
software than before. Nowadays they must not only control the internal
workings of the computer they dwell in, they must also take care of the
complexities of networks and be able to communicate with other systems.
The stability of the personal computer software industry is, therefore,
under threat. Microsoft's MS/DOS - with an estimated 150m users worldwide -
has dominated the PC industry for a decade and fought off every challenge.
But at the end of 1992 US networking software company Novell declared its
intent to take over the development of Unix, one of the two biggest
challengers to MS/DOS. Originally developed by AT&amp;T for minicomputers, Unix
has been widely adopted as the universal operating system for mid-range
computers - although it has, for some time, been touted as a possible
candidate to replace MS/DOS. Through the takeover of Unix Systems
Laboratories (USL), which was set up in 1991 to co-ordinate development of
Unix for the industry as a whole, Novell hopes to become the 'custodian' of
Unix and mount a serious challenge to Microsoft.
Novell hopes to do this by bringing Unix together with PC networks.
Novell is in a good position to achieve this. It has established itself as
the dominant supplier of networking software for personal computer local
area networks (LANS) with its Netware package. It claims to have about 70
per cent of this growing market and has itself beaten off a challenge from
Microsoft - which also has designs on this important market.
Novell's takeover has other implications - especially in the market for
corporate computer networks. USL also controls the development of an
important software product called Tuxedo - a package that can combine
traditional corporate transaction processing with personal computer
networking.
Novell's move has occurred at a time when the limitations of personal
computer software are becoming increasingly evident. Their lack, both of
system security and the robustness associated with operating software on
large computers, has led to close examination of operating system software
and what it might be required to do in the next decade.
If Novell combines its successful networking software with the virtues
offered by Unix and Tuxedo, it could outflank Microsoft.
It will certainly change the fate of Unix.
'We see Novell skewing development towards the integration of Unix with
networks,' says Paul McGuckin, a mid-range computing specialist at market
researchers Gartner Group.
'It will concentrate on the kernel, low-level operating software - at the
expense of the high-level stuff. This could mean that Unix vendors will have
to be more self-reliant as far as the high-end development is concerned,' Mr
McGuckin adds.
The technological intricacies of computer operating systems are generally
beyond most computer users. Unfortunately, the choice of an operating system
is as important as the choice of the computer hardware it runs on. Operating
systems organise the internal workings of a computer and, as a consequence,
they dictate what the computer can do and what applications software can be
used.
The MS/DOS PC launched by IBM a decade ago brought stability for the first
time and allowed the development of a wide range of applications.
The success of the graphical user interface (GUI) on the Apple Macintosh
prompted Microsoft to add the Windows GUI and make significant improvements
to the original software, but MS/DOS is still outdated and in need of
replacement.
Specifically, MS/DOS has failed to make any impact on the world of networked
systems - the area where Novell dominates.
The final result of the conflict is far from clear. Microsoft continues to
improve MS/DOS and is in the process of developing Windows/NT - an entirely
new contender. IBM continues to promote OS/2 with varying degrees of
success. And, the many versions of Unix - including AIX from IBM itself -
vie with each other for dominance.
Mr Brian McBride, IBM UK's AIX marketing director, sees Novell's takeover of
Unix as 'healthy' because it brings stability to Unix. 'We see it as a
different implementation that we can communicate with. None of use can
afford to lock each other out in a networked world and we are all being
driven to standards-based inter-operability.'
Mr McBride is confident about IBM's ability to integrate Unix, PC networks
and corporate computing - in addition to maintaining links with other
systems.
Where it could come into conflict with Novell, however, is in the area of
transaction processing and USL's Tuxedo - an increasingly important part of
the link between personal and corporate computing.
'You can link a DOS/PC into Unix systems with Tuxedo. It is an open
transaction processing system,' explains Ms Gillian Mogg Smith a consultant
at USL.
'Linking it with Novell is a separate issue. But we have already done much
work with Novell with the UnixWare development,' she adds.
Tuxedo dominates the open transaction processing market - but IBM is hot on
its heels. IBM's rival to USL's Tuxedo is a Unix-based version of its
25-year-old CICS teleprocessing package. Developed originally for
mainframe-based on-line processing, CICS is a well-established and mature
piece of software with about 33,000 principal sites across the world.
Last year IBM announced CICS/6000, a version which will run under AIX/Unix
and allow personal computers to act as 'client' terminals to an
enterprise-wide computer system. IBM has licensed CICS to Hewlett Packard,
which will build a 'reference' version to work on other manufacturers'
mid-range Unix systems.
According to the Gartner Group, this sector is set to expand rapidly in the
next three years. It says that the total market for mid-range transaction
processing was worth only Dollars 190m last year. By 1995 it will be worth
Dollars 3bn worldwide - with Tuxedo and CICS/6000 taking more than 50 per
cent of the market between them.
This is rich ground for a battle between IBM and Novell. It also seems
likely that Microsoft - while having no obvious plans to get into this area
 -will certainly be keeping an eye on it.

<TEXT>     The Windows 3.1 Professional Developers Conference opened on the 10th
anniversary of the debut of the IBM Personal Computer and its
Microsoft-developed operating system, MS-DOS.;    The relationship between
Microsoft and IBM has become hostile.;    Microsoft has staked its future on a
program called Windows, while IBM has pursued a computer operating system
called OS/2.;    Windows makes IBM-type computers easier to operate by giving
them a graphics-based operating system similar to that popularized by Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh. Windows works in conjunction with DOS.;   
Conference attendees ranged from owners of one- or two-person software firms
to software developers from large corporations.;    Their interest is "vital,"
said Steve Ballmer, senior vice president for systems software at Microsoft,
based in suburban Redmond. "That's the No. 1 asset Windows has. Four million
users and all these developers.";    IBM developed OS/2 with Microsoft as a
successor to MS-DOS. But Microsoft scored a hit with Windows and has all but
abandoned OS/2. It has sold more than 4 million copies since Windows Version
3.0 was introduced in May 1990 and expects to sell nearly 8 million this year,
Ballmer said.;    The conference is aimed at whipping up enthusiasm for
Windows and helping speed developers' work on programs that use a new version
of Windows, 3.1, due out before the end of the year.;    Thousands of
application programs have been written for Windows, and Microsoft has shipped
more than 70,000 kits used by developers to write more software, Ballmer
said.;    Version 3.1 will be a fine-tuning of Windows, he said. Microsoft
plans upgrades in coming years, including Windows NT -- for new technology --
a version for high-powered personal computers and work stations due out in
1992.;    Ballmer said Microsoft doesn't plan to modify any of its
applications programs to run on future versions of OS/2. Instead, he said,
Microsoft counts on IBM producing OS/2 so it runs programs written for
Windows.;    He told the audience he had heard IBM intends to have OS/2 do a
better job of running Windows applications than Windows does.;    "It tells us
that even IBM recognizes that if OS/2 is going to succeed, it's going to
succeed because it runs the applications that you're writing," he said.  </TEXT>

   Making a rare public forecast, Microsoft Corp. officials predicted Friday that industrywide sales of personal computers, which swelled 30% in the company's fiscal year ended June 30, 1987, will grow at a 26% clip this fiscal year. 

   The personal computer software company also said it doesn't expect the majority of personal computer users to buy its much-ballyhooed, new OS/2 operating system until 1990 or 1991. 

   According to Microsoft's best estimates, said Steven Ballmer, vice president, systems software, personal computer sales grew to 6.5 million units in fiscal 1987 from five million units the year earlier. 
Now Microsoft expects sales to reach 8.2 million units for fiscal 1988. 
Moreover, during fiscal 1988, Microsoft expects 55% of all International Business Machines Corp. personal computers and compatible machines sold to be high-performance models capable of running the new OS/2 operating system. 
In fiscal 1987, only 42% were the high-powered models. 

   Microsoft is in a unique position to track and estimate personal computer sales because it provides the operating system software for IBM's personal computers and compatible machines made by other companies, which together account for 90% of all personal computers sold. 
Microsoft officials, who in the past have kept such projections to themselves, made the predictions at a seminar held for reporters and analysts last week to outline progress in refining the long-awaited OS/2. 

   Despite Microsoft's hard numbers predicting heady growth through midyear, "the outlook for personal computer sales for all of calendar 1988 is still unclear . . . because a lot of that sales growth Microsoft is talking about is under our belts already," said David Readerman, a Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. analyst. 

   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Microsoft closed down $1.125 at $53.875 a share. 

   IBM and Microsoft, which together designed OS/2, began shipping to customers in December a version that didn't include the "presentation manager" feature that handles on-screen graphics. 
Without that feature, OS/2 is difficult to use, and applications programs -- word processors, financial spreadsheets and the like -- can't easily take advantage of fancy graphics or the system's ability to juggle several programs at once. 

   According to Mr. Ballmer, Microsoft will send out an early version of OS/2 with the presentation manager to independent software developers in March so they can begin fitting applications programs to it. 
IBM will ship the complete version to its customers in October, and other manufacturers of IBM-compatible machines will ship copies in early 1989, he said. 

   Mr. Ballmer cautioned that there won't be much reason to use OS/2 until software companies develop programs that tap its full power and special features. 
"I wish we could quiet down all this talk about buying OS/2 for its own sake and wait for the new applications," said Mr. Ballmer. 

   Those applications should arrive in a torrent late this year or early next year, according to William Lowe, the executive in charge of IBM's personal computer efforts. 
"We share (Microsoft Chairman William) Gates's goal of seeing 1,000 applications programs (tuned to OS/2) shipped by the end of 1988," Mr. Lowe told the seminar. 

   Even so, neither Mr. Lowe nor Mr. Gates believes OS/2 will catch on immediately in a big way, mainly because personal computer users will still get a lot of use out of programs that work with OS/2's precursor, MS-DOS. 
According to Mr. Gates's estimates, only about 15% of all new personal computers sold in 1989 will use OS/2, and it will be mid-1991 before 50% of all new machines will use OS/2.

MICROSOFT BUYS STAKE IN MAJOR SELLER OF UNIX SYSTEM SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Microsoft Corp., already the world's leading supplier of personal computer 
software, announced a deal Wednesday that will allow it to expand its lead. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said that it is buying less than 20% in Santa Cruz Operation, the 
largest independent seller of Unix operating system software. Terms of the deal 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Operating systems, which direct the data flow of a computer, vary among 
computer manufacturers. But, increasingly, manufacturers are attempting to 
rally behind just a few systems that will become the standards for the entire 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
In the personal computer industry, the standards so far have been Microsoft's 
DOS and OS/2, used on IBM and IBM-compatible machines, and Apple's proprietary 
Macintosh system. 
</P>
<P>
Unix, much like No. 3 auto maker Chrysler, has run a very distant third, and 
was mostly dismissed as an arcane system mostly for use by engineers and 
accountants with sophisticated computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's acquisition was seen as underscoring two significant shifts in the 
personal computer industry. It demonstrates the growing acceptance of Unix as 
an operating system for the desktop computer, as well as the determination of 
Microsoft, which already provides the operating system used by a majority of 
personal computers on the market today, to take advantage of this new market. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Microsoft's way of saying that it wants to be a software 
conglomerate," said Thomas Friedberg, a Seattle-based analyst with the 
investment firm of Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood. "Microsoft wants to be all 
things to all people." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, most personal computer makers and software publishers have 
considered the complicated and sophisticated Unix system as more suited to 
large, powerful multi-user computers and not independent desk-top personal 
computers used by office workers. 
</P>
<P>
And Microsoft, led by chairman and chief Unix critic William H. Gates, was no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the investment in Santa Cruz Operation demonstrates that such 
an assessment may have been off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Chairman "Bill Gates may rail about Unix not being right for the 
personal computer, but he is an excellent businessman, and if there is a buck 
to be made on it, he will find a way to make it," analyst Friedberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts said the deal was a sure boost for the participants, they 
noted that it could spell trouble for other companies that have been trying to 
promote Unix systems for personal computers. Although Microsoft has not 
supported the use of Unix for personal computers until now, the company is no 
stranger to the system. In the early 1980s, the company developed its own 
version of Unix called Xenix. 
</P>
<P>
However, in 1981 the company decided to concentrate on its DOS and OS/2 system, 
and it contracted with Santa Cruz Operation to market Xenix.

FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: Bruised but not beaten - Microsoft is giving
mixed signals about its future prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

<TEXT>
For Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, these are trying times. His company is
under scrutiny for alleged anti-trust violations; Wall Street has soured on
the stock; and after 18 years of spectacular growth Microsoft is planning
for a 'bumpy' year ahead. Could Microsoft have lost the golden touch that
has enabled it to become the largest software company in the world, made
Gates, 37, the richest man in the US and created hundreds of millionaires
among its employees?
This is the sort of question that irritates Gates. From his perspective,
Microsoft's achievements to date have nothing to do with a Midas charm,
rather they reflect hard work and perseverance, long-term vision and
commitment.
He has no patience with 'simplistic analysis' that assumes Microsoft will
inevitably be successful in anything the company turns its hand to. Or, as
is now the case, that short-term expectations for slower growth may signal
that Microsoft's glory days are coming to a close.
Indeed, predicting the outlook for Microsoft is complicated by numerous
issues. Not the least of these is whether Microsoft will face an anti-trust
suit. The US Justice Department is currently reviewing documents from a
three-and-a-half year investigation conducted by the US Federal Trade
Commission.
Other problems for Microsoft include a downward trend in software prices and
a weak market environment in Europe, one of its largest markets. With no big
operating system software product introductions planned for the next 12
months, Microsoft also faces an unusual dry spell. Revenues from the
company's core business - software for office PCs - may grow less rapidly
than in the past.
Yet the company is driving ahead with ambitious plans to enter new markets
such as programs for hand-held 'personal digital assistants,' software for
children, multimedia products and software for the 'digital highways' of the
future.
Microsoft is also developing two new generations of personal computer
operating systems; one for desktop PCs, codenamed Chicago, and a second,
called Cairo, for computer networks (see below).
But torn between blowing Microsoft's trumpet, to impress customers and
investors, or highlighting its vulnerabilities, to appease Washington
regulators, Gates and other Microsoft executives are delivering a mixed
message about the company's future prospects.
'In looking at this industry and Microsoft's role in it, I am very
optimistic,' Gates says. 'We are investing in a very optimistic way.'
In the next breath, however, he is urging caution. 'A number of these
investments may take a long time to pay off,' he says. 'If these new things
kick in, then we will go back to higher growth. If we're wrong, then we
won't ever advance beyond the level we are at today.'
Microsoft's propensity to point out the risks associated with entering new
markets, and that even its new PC software products could 'bomb', has
contributed to Wall Street's uncertainties.
'That tone of conservatism is part of our culture. We expect good results,
but prefer them to come as surprises,' Gates says. Yet veteran Microsoft
watchers believe that the company's recent emphasis on potential problems is
at least in part aimed at the ears of anti-trust regulators in Washington
DC.
For example, Microsoft is at pains to point out that it does have
competitors. Executives even highlighted rival products in a presentation to
financial analysts less than two weeks ago. And in an attempt to win
political support, Gates reels off the benefits which the PC industry has
provided to the US economy, such as growth in exports and the creation of
jobs.
'Today's software business is thriving, and it is not just Microsoft,' says
Gates. 'There are 750 software companies in the state of Washington alone
and the majority of them write software (applications programs) for
Microsoft Windows. Net employment went up by more than the size of Microsoft
just in the last year. . .the incredible thing is how well the US has done
in this business.' The Clinton administration would be foolish to do
anything that threatened the future of Microsoft, Gates seems to be
implying.
Politics aside, the greatest challenges facing Microsoft lie in the
development of a series of ground-breaking technologies. Gates is placing a
big bet on software for 'digital highways' - which could deliver multimedia
information services to millions of businesses and homes.
His goal is to establish a software standard for the way people use
information services, whether they be entertainment services on interactive
television, public information services at a kiosk in a shopping centre or
business information services in the office.
Partnerships - with cable television companies, telephone companies and
companies in the entertainment field - will be an important aspect of
Microsoft's involvement in digital highways. While denying reports that
Microsoft has already struck a deal, Gates acknowledges that Microsoft is
talking to US West as well as other US telephone companies, and TCI and Time
Warner, the two largest US cable television companies. The gold rush
surrounding 'digital convergence' also has movie moguls, newspaper
companies, AT&amp;T and IBM knocking on his door, Gates says.
'You will see us enter into all sorts of partnerships.' Some will merely be
agreements to collaborate in trials of interactive television service.
Others may be 'hard-core joint ventures'. Microsoft also plans to make
minority equity investments in companies involved in digital highways.
'I am not aware of any other company that is making the kind of bet that we
are on digital information highways,' Gates says. The company will spend
'many tens of millions of dollars' developing the technology, and 'won't get
any revenue for at least three years. And it could all be wasted, but that
is the name of the game'.
The 'game' of spotting new technology directions and turning them into
business opportunities is one at which Gates is a master and with Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in cash resources, Microsoft can even afford to lose a
few rounds.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Novell gains OS market foothold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WENDY GOLDMAN ROHM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOVELL, the US software company, and Zenith Data Systems, the personal
computer subsidiary of Groupe Bull of France, have reached an agreement
which should give Novell a toe-hold in the market for personal computer
operating software.
The operating system (OS) is the software program that controls the basic
functions of a computer. The OS market is dominated by Microsoft of the US,
which charges manufacturers a licence fee for each computer sold with its
MS/DOS system. Most of the world's 90m personal computers run MS/DOS. Apple
personal computers are the major exception.
In January, however, Zenith is set to launch a line of personal computers,
called Personal Servers, pre-loaded with Novell's DOS software, a program
that directly competes with Microsoft's MS-DOS.
Analysts said the move would represent a significant breach of Microsoft's
control over the PC operating system software market.
A broader deal, being evaluated by Groupe Bull's Zenith as well as
Packard-Bell, the US PC manufacturer in which Bull last year acquired a 19.9
per cent stake, could enable Novell to encroach still further into
Microsoft's territory.
ZDS is considering pre-loading Novell's latest version of DOS on its desktop
PC products; PC buyers would be given a choice of using the Microsoft or
Novell operating systems.
No PC maker has yet pre-loaded its machines with Novell DOS. Computer
companies say that is because they are already locked into contracts with
Microsoft that require them to pay a royalty fee on every machine they ship.
Microsoft, however, asserts that its licensing policies apply to particular
PC models, rather than to the full range of a PC manufacturer's products. A
spokesman also noted that computer makers can opt to license Microsoft
software on a per copy basis, if they choose.
With Novell apparently offering more favourable terms than Microsoft for DOS
programs, other PC manufacturers are expected to watch Zenith's moves
closely.
Mr Raymond Noorda, Novell chief executive said: 'These manufacturers are in
a low margin business. They want to get computers out the door and make a
penny on every one of them.
'They cannot fool around with large dollar issues on the costs of what they
ship. Paying Microsoft a royalty is a significant part of the total cost.'
Zenith is understood to have spent months searching for a loophole in its
Microsoft DOS licensing contract to ensure it would not owe royalties to
Microsoft for its new Personal Servers. The contract stated that royalties
would not be owed on machines that could not run Microsoft DOS. Zenith
engineers made sure this would be the case for the new computers.
While allowing computers on a local area network to run existing software,
the Personal Server, which controls the network, will be driven by Novell
DOS. PC users on the network need not know nor care which operating system
is running on the Personal Server, experts say.

<P>
In an effort to boost the development of a major new market for personal 
computer hardware and software, Microsoft Corp. and a number of PC 
manufacturers on Tuesday announced a set of basic standards for so-called 
multimedia computers. 
</P>
<P>
Multimedia combines traditional computing functions with high-quality sound and 
video, thus opening a broad new range of possible applications. Technological 
advances over the past several years have rendered multimedia practical on 
standard personal computers, and many companies have seized on multimedia in 
recent months as a key growth area. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's announcement was an effort to establish a minimum set of criteria for 
multimedia personal computers, thus allowing software developers to write 
multimedia programs with a knowledge of what kind of hardware will be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Tandy Corp., parent company of the Radio Shack electronics chain, joined with 
nine other computer vendors in agreeing to ship a multimedia machine by next 
year. Such a system will include an IBM-compatible personal computer with 
either a 286 or 386 microprocessor from Intel Corp. that's equipped with at 
least 2 megabytes of memory, a 30-megabyte hard disk drive, VGA graphics, a 
digital audio system and a CD-ROM laser disk drive. In addition, the machines 
will include Microsoft's Windows operating software equipped with special 
multimedia extensions. 
</P>
<P>
A multimedia package would add about $1,000 to the cost of a typical business 
PC. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines, while not committing to specific hardware 
deliveries, is supporting the initiative in promoting the development of 
multimedia software for its OS/2 operating system. 
</P>
<P>
Among the computer vendors joining Tandy in supporting a multimedia platform 
are AT&amp;T, NEC, Fujitsu, Olivetti and Zenith. Tandy said it would promote 
multimedia through special promotions in its Radio Shack stores. 
</P>
<P>
While Tuesday's announcement should give a lift to multimedia development 
efforts, it did not resolve many of the thornier issues, such as exactly how 
full-motion video will be handled in future multimedia computers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, computer vendors whose machines are not IBM-compatible, such as 
Apple Computer and Next Inc., are pushing ahead with their own multimedia 
plans.

Novell, the US networking software company, is positioning itself for what
may become the computer software marketing battle of the decade, with its
planned acquisition of AT&amp;T's Unix Systems Laboratories.
Novell is on a collision course with Microsoft, reigning champion of the
software industry, in a fight to establish the dominant software system for
the next generation of networked computer systems.
Currently, Novell is the leading supplier of software that manages the
communications between computers linked on networks. Microsoft, however,
leads the market for personal computer operating systems.
The functions of operating systems and network management systems are,
however, beginning to overlap and the trend is expected to accelerate when
Microsoft next year launches 'Windows NT' a new version of its popular
personal computer operating system that incorporates network management
functions.
What is more, Microsoft has ambitions way beyond the desktop computer. Mr
Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive, has made no secret of
the fact that with Windows NT he aims to address a broader segment of the
computer market, including classes of computers that run the Unix operating
system.
Thus Novell's acquisition of Unix represents a move to counter Microsoft's
anticipated attack. By putting its marketing muscle behind Unix, Novell aims
to accelerate the adoption of the AT&amp;T developed operating system and
reinforce its role as an 'industry standard'.
Yet with the acquisition of USL, Novell will also inherit a history of
feuding over Unix which began in the mid-1980s with AT&amp;T's unpopular steps
toward 'commercialising' the operating system through a partnership with Sun
Microsystems, the leading workstation manufacturer.
Rival industry groups backed different versions of Unix, amid suspicions
AT&amp;T was favouring Sun over other computer makers.
These battles led to the formation of USL, in 1991, as an independent
business unit that would develop Unix technology while providing all
licensees with equal access to development plans. This was underscored by
the acquisition of minority stakes in USL by several computer and software
companies.
Novell's acquisition of USL will, however, once more place Unix under the
control of a single company, potentially resurrecting the old 'Unix wars'.
'Since AT&amp;T will no longer own USL, this eliminates some of the old
prejudices that have kept Unix in two camps and can help lead to the
unification of Unix,' said Mr Willem Roelandts, Hewlett-Packard
vice-president and general manager of the computer systems.
HP was a founding member of the Open Software Foundation, an industry group
that emerged in opposition to AT&amp;T's control over Unix. HP already has 'an
excellent relationship' with Novell, Mr Roelandts said. The same is true of
several other open systems computer manufactures.
Unix International, an industry organisation formed to back AT&amp;T's version
of Unix, was also quick to pronounce its approval of the Novell acquisition.
'As part of Novell, USL has pledged its commitment to fair and neutral
access to Unix technology,' said Mr Peter Cunningham, UI president and chief
executive.
The willingness of Unix supporters to adopt Novell as their new champion and
put aside the in-fighting that has characterised the open-systems movement
over the past few years represents a strong endorsement of Novell. It also,
however, suggests a closing of ranks in anticipation of the battle between
Unix and Microsoft's Windows NT.

MICROSOFT, the US computer software group, is in talks with Time Warner, the
entertainment group, and Tele-Communications Inc, the big cable television
company, to set up a joint venture to develop interactive software for
television, according to news reports.
Although the three companies have not commented on the reports, their
negotiations are expected to lead to the establishment of a new company
producing software for cable television boxes.
The software would provide cable subscribers with access to a wide array of
interactive information and services. It would allow them to shop by
television, view individually-selected news and statistics, or select films
and video games from a vast electronic library.
The link-up between Microsoft, Time Warner and TCI would represent the
latest in a series of moves by large computer, entertainment and
communications companies joining forces to develop interactive media
technology for cable television users.
In April, Microsoft announced it was getting together with the micro-chip
manufacturer Intel and cable hardware company General Instrument to develop
a cable TV box with a built-in interactive personal computer.

<HEAD>IBM Denies Rift With Microsoft, But Some Analysts Unconvinced</HEAD>

   IBM and Microsoft Corp. say their relationship
has never been better as they sought to quiet talk that a rift was
developing between the computer hardware and software giants.
   Millions of personal computer users worldwide use machines
designed to IBM and Microsoft standards.
   ``IBM today reaffirmed its relatioship with Microsoft,'' the
computer company said Monday.
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said in a separate statement:
``Microsoft and IBM have played a key role in the development of
the PC industry and we will continue to cooperate to provide the
best operating system solutions to our customers.''
   Talk that IBM and Microsoft were at odds has peppered trade
journals in recent weeks.
   In an interview, Steve Ballmer, a Microsoft vice president,
disputed reports that the two companies had stopped working
together on new versions of operating systems, the base layer of
software that controls a computer's internal functions.
   But the companies announced they would divide responsibility for
developing new versions of two operating systems: OS-2, used on
IBM's Personal System-2 computers, and DOS, the operating system
for IBM's older personal computers and many brands of
IBM-compatible machines.
   Previously, each company worked separately on developing new
versions of OS-2 and DOS. Under the new arrangement, IBM will have
primary responsibility for developing OS-2, while Microsoft will
have the primary role in improving DOS. William Bluestein, an
analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., interpreted
that as an admission the two companies had gone separate ways.
   ``It basically is a form of divorce,'' he said. ``What really is
being fought over is who controls the industry, who controls the
direction.''
   By controling the development of operating systems and the
timing of their release, Microsoft could influence sales of IBM
computers, while IBM could affect sales of the applications
software Microsoft makes, analysts say.
   But Aaron Goldberg, an analyst at International Data Corp., said
he believed the explanation by IBM and Microsoft that they only
wanted to improve the development process for operating systems.
   ``They have agreed to split the load a little better,'' he said.
``Microsoft doesn't have all the resources to chase every product.
   ``This to me is a perfect case in where our comptuer industry
trade press is trying to find a fire where there is no smoke,'' he
added.
   As part of the new arrangement, Microsoft will have the main
responsibility for developing a version of OS-2 for computers whose
central processor uses a technology called reduced-instruction-set
computing, or RISC, which primarily is used in powerful desktop
workstations. Bluestein called that a bone IBM threw Microsoft.
   OS-2 was jointly announced by IBM and Microsoft in 1987 as their
answer to the ease-of-use of Apple Computer Inc.'s popular
Macintosh.
   But the operating system has been slow to catch on, in part
because it can't be used with applications software, such as
spreadsheets, designed for DOS. It also is limited because it must
be used on machines that have a certain memory capacity - more than
many older computers have.
   Additionally, Microsoft has been heavily promoting a software
product called Windows that provides much of the Macintosh's
features on a DOS-equipped machine.
   IBM also said Monday that it would license the Windows software
from Microsoft, however IBM did not say whether it would provide
the feature with their machines.
   Last fall, to dispel similar rumors of a rift, IBM and Microsoft
jointly announced their strategy for OS-2 and Windows. They said
Windows was aimed at less-powerful computers using DOS, and OS-2
was designed for machines with greater memory.
   But IBM has said it is developing a version of OS-2 for older
computers that have less memory.
   That decision caused some industry-watchers to question its
support of Windows. Analysts also say Windows poses a threat to
OS-2, since it gies owners of older machines less incentive to
upgrade to models that could use OS-2.

FT  26 APR 94 / Technology: Right to reverse engineer - A US battle to
produce compatible software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US software industry is in turmoil over a court decision that may
severely limit companies' ability to produce compatible software products.
At issue is the continuing legal fall-out from two court rulings involving
Microsoft, the world's largest producer of personal computer software, and
Stac Electronics - a relatively small producer of 'data compression'
software.
Stac recently won a verdict of patent infringement against Microsoft,
forcing the software giant to remove a 'DoubleSpace' feature that almost
doubles the amount of data that can be stored on a personal computer hard
disk, from its products.
This verdict has caused much discussion in the software industry. But a
second, less publicised ruling, made in Microsoft's favour, is prompting
more serious debate. Stac has been ordered to pay Microsoft damages of
Dollars 13.6m (Pounds 9.3m) for misappropriation of trade secrets.
Stac denies any wrongdoing, saying that it only 'reverse engineered'
portions of Microsoft's MS-Dos PC operating system. Reverse engineering is a
common practice in the computer industry. It involves examining the
components and functions of a product to produce a competitive product that
matches the functions of the original.
Stac revealed during the trial that it made use of what are known as
'undocumented system calls' to produce its Stacker product. This product
also expands the data storage capacity of a PC hard disk, to work more
efficiently with the MS-Dos operating system. Undocumented system calls are
those parts of the operating system that are not detailed in manuals. Given
the complexity of the software, there are typically several undocumented
elements to an operating system.
'We are concerned that the jury has found that Microsoft can protect
undocumented calls as trade secrets,' says Gary Clow, chairman and chief
executive of Stac Electronics. The decision 'will have a profound effect on
how companies, both large and small, compete in the software industry', he
predicts.
Critics of the ruling say the central issue is 'reverse engineering'. They
say that if companies cannot use reverse engineering design methods it will
become very difficult to create products that work well with established
programs from large software companies such as Microsoft. This has prompted
an investigation of the case by the US Justice Department, which is already
conducting an extensive anti-trust investigation into Microsoft's business
practices.
According to San Francisco-based copyright attorney Robert Barr, who
represents several US software houses, the ruling could drive some software
companies to move to Europe because the European Community's software
directives 'expressly make it proper to reverse-engineer in the way that
Stac Electronics reverse-engineered parts of MS-Dos 6'.
'It would be a shot in the arm to the European software industry,' he says.
'The allegedly wrongful act (of reverse-engineering) would be legal in the
UK, so Microsoft would be hard-pressed to block exports to the US.'
Microsoft, however, simply says the jury made the right decision which Stac
must accept.
'A federal jury in LA returned a verdict against Stac on a trade-secret
claim by Microsoft. The jury even awarded punitive damages because it
considered Stac's actions deliberate,' says Paul Maritz, senior
vice-president of systems at Microsoft.
'Since then, Stac's president Gary Clow and others have devoted an enormous
amount of energy . . . trying to foster the belief that Microsoft will use
this verdict to pursue claims against (other) third-party developers who
legitimately use debugging tools to achieve or maintain compatibility with
Microsoft's operating systems. These statements just aren't true.'

   OS/2, the new PC operating system Microsoft announced for
IBM three years ago, today is an also-ran. It requires too
much computer memory, and some promised features haven't
arrived. It also can't run Windows applications.
   Microsoft has sold only a few hundred thousand copies of
OS/2. Mr. Gates seems to be trying to lower expectations for
it, saying he now expects it to coexist with the current PC
standard, MS-DOS, for years instead of replacing it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With IBM, Microsoft is at work on a new version of OS/2
that will run Windows. It will also make better use of the
most popular microprocessor, Intel's 80386. "We have to
provide a seamless, easy transition from the old to the new,"
says Microsoft president Jon Shirley. "That's something we've
failed to do in prior versions of OS/2." Mr. Gates insists
OS/2 will emerge later in the decade as the operating
software of choice for PC users.
   "People said we'd fail" with Windows, he says. "Now
they're saying we'll fail with OS/2. We won't."
   For Microsoft's sake, it better not. OS/2 is the only
operating system the company controls with as much power as
Unix, an older system created by American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, which is the standard for engineering and
scientific computers and is slowly catching on with
white-collar workers.

company and products at news conferences and other public forums.;   But at
the huge Comdex computer show, which concluded Friday, the sparring between
the two giants of the industry was notably absent.;   IBM spokesman Kevin

Microsoft makes DOS, the operating system used on the majority of personal
computers. But it is building its future on Windows, a program that gives IBM

originally developed with Microsoft as the eventual replacement for DOS.;  
The two companies ended their OS/2 cooperation early this year. Since then,

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates criticized IBM, saying the computer giant
delivered poorly done computer code for OS/2 while the two were still
cooperating.;   Though IBM and Microsoft heavily promoted their operating

   Microsoft Says FTC Inquiry Is Limited
   To Window Program; Stock Falls $3.50

   William Gates III, chairman of Microsoft Corp., downplayed
the significance of a Federal Trade Commission inquiry,
saying it focuses narrowly on an allegation that the company
made an attempt at "restricting the functionality and
features" of its flagship Windows program.
   "It is not broader than that," said Mr. Gates, who
disputed assertions that the FTC was more broadly
scrutinizing the company's competitive practices. The inquiry
"has no relationship to systems and applications in any way
shape or form," he said, referring to the two basic parts of
Microsoft's business.

   Microsoft's stock was jolted, falling $3.50 to $95.75 in
national over-the-counter trading on news of the
investigation into the Redmond, Wash., company, the country's
largest supplier of personal-computer software.
   Mr. Gates said that the FTC probe, which began last June,
also covers International Business Machines Corp., the
nation's largest computer maker and a key Microsoft partner
for a decade. He said that the probe strictly flows out of a
joint announcement from the two companies in November 1989
regarding mutual software plans. In that announcement, the
two companies disclosed plans to limit the capabilities given
to Windows and add other features to OS/2, another systems
software developed by the two firms.
   Since then, Microsoft has boosted the capabilities of
Windows and downgraded the importance of OS/2 in a move at
odds with IBM. This flip-flop by Microsoft may concern the
FTC because some software makers complain that it gave
Microsoft an unfair advantage in developing other products.
   Mr. Gates said he's tried to convince investigators that
the issue of limiting Windows is "moot because of the
aggressiveness we've had with Windows." He said, however,
that the FTC hasn't relented in its inquiry, indicating that
Microsoft's shifting postures toward Windows over the past 18
months concern the FTC.
   A senior FTC official declined to confirm or deny that IBM
is under scrutiny.
   An IBM spokesman in Armonk, N.Y., said: "We are aware of a
nonpublic FTC investigation relating to a press release
issued in 1989. The FTC has asked us for some information,
and we've cooperated fully."
   Attorneys who specialize in antitrust law said that
Microsoft may have gotten the attention of government
investigators simply because it has obtained so much sway
over the software industry through its virtual control over
system software, key programs which control the basic
operations of a personal computer.
   Yet bigness doesn't necessarily mean badness, attorneys
cautioned. And even when companies dominating huge markets
play loose with the rules it is exceedingly hard to
demonstrate in court.
   "It's very hard to establish that a company is doing
anything other than normal puffing and promotion," said
Thomas E. Kauper, a law professor at the University of
Michigan Law School.
   Still, once the FTC digs into a case, it can uncover other
areas of concern. Mr. Gates conceded that the FTC already has
sought a substantial amount of company-confidential material
and that before it is finished with its inquiry he expects
investigators "to get more boxes of documents . . . They'll
have a lot of paper to read."
   Legal specialists say that, as described, the inquiry
sounds extensive. "When they {the FTC} start seeking
documents, the investigation reaches a level of real
seriousness," said William E. Kovacic, a former FTC attorney
and a professor at George Mason University School of Law.
   Such an inquiry also can turn up fresh areas of concern,
such as an alleged practice whereby Microsoft "ties" the
purchase of one set of products, such as word processing
programs, to the purchase of another set of products such as
system software. The practice of tying isn't unusual, and
"the law is unclear on it," said Boris Feldman, an attorney
in Palo Alto, Calif.
   Mr. Gates said that the FTC isn't looking at any potential
leverage in the market that Microsoft gains from having a
dominant position in system software and an increasingly
strong one in applications software. However, Microsoft's
decision to at first limit Windows, and then expand its
utility, have led other software companies to raise broad
issues of unfair competition and manipulation.
   The prospect of a detailed probe into Microsoft worries
investors who are valuing the stock at roughly $10 billion,
or about 25 times Microsoft's expected earnings in fiscal
year 1991. "Any FTC investigation should be taken seriously,"
said Bob Therrien, an analyst at PaineWebber.

   Microsoft Corp. said 26 more computer equipment makers have agreed to license its latest operating system software for so-called local-area networks. 

   The new licensees, which include American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., Ungermann-Bass Inc. and Tandy Corp., join six other companies that previously agreed to license the software, including International Business Machines Corp., and bring the total number of licensees to 32. 
Local-area networks, or LANs, allow desktop-computer users to share information electronically. 

   Microsoft's quest to license its new LAN software, code-named OS/2 LAN Manager, is integral to the product's success because Microsoft manufactures no hardware itself, relying on its licensing agreements with equipment makers to boost sales. 

   Microsoft is best known as the publisher of the MS-DOS operating system for personal computers, the standard program that controls the flow of data in IBM-made PCs and compatible machines.

<HEAD>Microsoft To Invest Heavily, Add 2,400 Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Microsoft Corp., riding a ``red hot'' hit
with its Windows 3.0 software, plans to invest millions of dollars
on new products and services and add more than 2,300 employees in
the next year, its executives say.
   Corporate officials also told financial analysts gathered at
Microsoft's headquarters Thursday that because of the spending, it
would be difficult to maintain the hectic pace of sales growth the
company has enjoyed.
   Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates said the new version
of Windows ``is the center of the universe for us now.'' The
program, which provides an easy-to-use framework for running
spreadsheets, word processors and other programs, will be further
improved this year and have more programs adapted to it, he said.
   Gates also said Microsoft was beginning a major move into office
computer networks and hoped to capture a share of that market now
dominated by Novell Inc. of Orem, Utah.
   Microsoft, the world's largest publisher of personal computer
software, reported Wednesday its profits for the fiscal year ended
June 30 grew 64 percent over the year before, while revenues rose
47 percent.
   ``We're extremely bullish on the markets we participate in from
a long-term standpoint,'' said Microsoft president Mike Hallman,
but added that projects would require ``some heavy investments this
year.''
   Asked whether Microsoft could sustain the 47 percent sales
growth, senior vice president and chief financial officer Frank
Gaudette replied, ``I think that would be on the very high end.''
   Microsoft's stock, which closed up $2 at $71.50 a share
Wednesday in over-the-counter trading, fell $2.75 a share to $68.75
Thursday.
   Neither Hallman nor Gates would say how much investment would be
required. But Steve Ballmer, senior vice president for systems
software, said his segment alone would spend $18 million and hire
500 more people to work on its new ``Network Specialist Program.''
   Microsoft spent $180 million on research and development and
$317 million on sales and marketing in fiscal 1990.
   Microsoft plans to grow from its present 5,635 employees to
about 8,000 over the next year. Hallman said the new workers would
include 750 in research and development and 1,250 in sales and
marketing.
   Microsoft, founded by the multibillionaire Gates and prep school
friend Paul Allen 15 years ago, had just 1,800 employees in 1987.
   It reported fiscal 1990 profits of $279.2 million or $2.34 a
share on revenues of $1.18 billion, both records. Net earnings for
fiscal 1989 were $170.5 million or $41.52 a share on revenues of
$803.5 million.
   Sales and profits were boosted by Windows 3.0, a runaway success
with 800,000 copies shipped since its introduction in late May,
Ballmer said. The software replaces the technical word commands
needed to manage programs and information in IBM personal computers
with on-screen graphics.
   ``It is absolutely red hot,'' Ballmer said.
   Microsoft shipped just 200,000 copies of its advanced computer
operating system OS-2 in all of fiscal 1990, Ballmer said.
   At one time, OS-2 was seen as the replacement for MS-DOS,
Microsoft's operating system that is the industry standard for
IBM-compatible computers. But with the huge success of Windows,
Microsoft now sees itself as having a ``family'' of operating
systems, with OS-2 an ``advanced form of Windows,'' Gates said.
   ``DOS is not likely to be replaced in the foreseeable future,''
Ballmer said.
   In the 1990s, Microsoft will evangelize for office and corporate
networks linking large computers and desktop computer users to
permit instant access to vast amounts of information, Ballmer said.
   To do that, Microsoft will introduce a new version of its Local
Area Network Manager software in August, is setting up a specially
trained group of resellers, and is boosting its sales and support
force, he said. It plans a major ad campaign and a series of
seminars this fall and winter to launch the Network Specialist
Program, he added.
   The target is Novell, which has 65 percent or better of the
existing office network market. Novell, founded in 1983 and the
maker of the NetWare operating system, had sales of $225.9 million
in the six months ended April 28.
   Capturing market share from Novell won't happen soon, Ballmer
said. ``We cannot overwhelm them. We have to show cleverness,'' he
said.
   Gates said he didn't see the move as dramatic or dangerous, but
necessary, since he believes networks will eventually dominate
office computing.
   A Novell official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
move by Microsoft had been expected for some time. By educating
more potential customers, Microsoft's heavy promotion of office
networks should benefit the industry as a whole, Novell included,
the official said.

FT  26 MAY 93 / Survey of Computer Industry - Systems, Software &amp; Services
(12): Rival threatens Unix - Open systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHIL MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE their long history, open systems are only now becoming a meaningful
reality. The trap of closed proprietary systems, which held most large
computer users in thrall for three decades, is finally fading to be replaced
by a freer, more flexible world of open systems, writes Phil Manchester.
In March this year an important group of leading computer manufacturers and
software developers announced its intention to put differences on one side
and co-operate in devising a Common Open Software Environment (Cose).
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Santa Cruz Operation, Sunsoft, Univel and Unix Systems
Laboratories agreed to work towards a Cose 'standard' based on the Unix
operating system.
Cose aims to define broad standards for desktop user interfaces, graphics,
networking, multimedia computing and systems management. Theoretically, any
Unix software developed by the Cose companies will be able to run on the
other member companies' platforms.
But there were two notable absentees from the initiative. Microsoft - which
is working on a rival operating environment based on its Windows software -
was not invited and neither was Apple.
The Cose announcement is the latest in a succession of alliances aimed at
promoting a single software environment for the computer industry - a factor
which has led the move to be viewed with some cynicism by commentators and
users. IBM and HP were already working together within the Open Software
Foundation, an alliance set up in the late 1980s to promote their respective
'flavours' of Unix.
OSF was established in competition with AT&amp;T, the originator of Unix, which
was promoting its own standards under an alliance called Unix International.
Its members included USL (now part of Novell) and Sun Microsystems -
Sunsoft's parent company.
The two rival groupings have been moving together for two or three years -
with Unix International adopting several OSF-sponsored standards and vice
versa.
The Cose standard, therefore, is a ratification of a process which was
already well under way.
The movement towards open systems began in the early 1980s, when many
companies noticed that their ability to take advantage of information
technology advances was constrained by the inertia of their investment
applications based on single manufacturer systems. If they were dissatisfied
with their hardware supplier, there was little they could do about it. They
either threw everything away and started again or they continued to dig
themselves deeper into the proprietary systems hole.
The advent of personal computing served to highlight the disadvantages of a
fragmented market. The quick acceptance of the IBM/MS/DOS personal computer
boosted the market and gave manufacturers and software developers a common
technology to build on.
More important, it meant that customers could - to a large extent - rely on
compatibility across different manufacturers' systems. At the same time, it
brought software prices down because development costs could be amortised
across a much large market. Much of the activity in open systems over the
last two or three years has been aimed at extending the idea of a common
open standard to large computer systems.
Mr Bernard Guidon, European marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard and a key
participant in the Cose discussions, says that the move was a response to
pressure from customers: 'Large global companies have systems from many
different manufacturers and want their applications software to be
consistent across different hardware,' he explains.
'If we want the Unix market to grow - then we need to get our act together
and come up with a common Unix.'
He adds that it was surprisingly easy to get technicians from the various
Cose members to devise a set of standards on which everyone could agree.
'We told them not to look at what they had done in the past - but to work on
the best technology for the future.'
The simple fact that all of the participants were already working with the
Unix operating system - despite small, annoying differences between the
different versions - made things easier.
Unix has been synonymous with open systems since the mid-1980s when it was
widely adopted by leading manufacturers as a way to offer a common platform
to build applications on.
But there is a growing school of thought which runs against Unix -
particularly with the increased dominance of Microsoft in the operating
systems market. About 200m personal computers around the world use Microsoft
operating software - either in the form of MS/DOS or the more recent Windows
environment. Microsoft hopes that they will move on to its Windows NT
environment - once it becomes established. Windows NT offers many of the
features which have made Unix attractive as the foundation for larger
computer systems.
Microsoft has good reason to feel confident that it will prevail. Software
application developers are strongly committed to re-developing their
products to work under Windows NT and many users will be looking for a
smooth upward migration path from their current personal computer systems.
But Mr Guidon is also optimistic. He expects Microsoft will be forced to
move closer to Cose standards. 'Large companies will put pressure on
Microsoft to conform in the long term,' he predicts.

   Compaq Computer Corp. said it will offer Microsoft Corp.'s OS/2 operating system and has shipped kits to assist software developers writing programs for the system. 

   The Houston-based computer maker, as expected, made the announcements as part of an effort to dispel apparent confusion that the Microsoft operating system due early next year might not work with Compaq computers. 
The operating system is software that directs some of a computer's basic operations. 

   The OS/2 system, scheduled for release in the 1988 first quarter, was announced April 2, the same day International Business Machines Corp. unveiled its Personal System/2 computer line. 
There has been some confusion in the personal computer industry that OS/2 would run only on PS/2 models. 

   At a news conference here, Compaq reiterated that the new operating system will run on its computers. 
Compaq said it would offer a version of OS/2, tailored slightly to its computers' specifications. 
Compaq said it sent more than 300 kits to software developers to help them write software to take advantage of certain features Compaq offers. 

   Rod Canion, Compaq president, said OS/2 will run better on Compaq computers than on IBM's new line "because of the higher performance of our PCs." 
IBM maintains the operating system will run faster and with improved graphics on its models.

FT  25 APR 94 / Microsoft tries to defuse new row: Software company accused
of trying to limit competitive activities of rivals

<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, which is being
investigated by the anti-trust division of the US Justice Department, is
attempting to blunt new industry charges that it tried to limit the
competitive activities of other software developers.
Microsoft angered computer industry executives and drew renewed attention
from the Justice Department last week, when it became known the company had
asked at least three software companies - Borland International, Lotus
Development and WordPerfect - to sign restrictive 'non-disclosure
agreements' (NDAs) if they got pre-release copies of a new version of
Windows, Microsoft's personal computer operating system program.
Microsoft now says it 'made a mistake' in demanding that the software
companies agree not to allow some of their programmers to work on products
that compete with Microsoft's Windows program for three years as a
pre-condition to granting them early access to the new version.
Without such access, the software companies could not continue development
of applications programs, such as word processing or data base programs, for
a large portion of the personal computer market. Microsoft's Windows is
installed in virtually all PCs except those from Apple Computer.
NDAs are widely used in the computer industry to protect confidential
technology, before general commercial release. But the new Microsoft
agreements contain unusual terms, software industry lawyers said.
They require, for example, that programmers - all of whom must be
individually approved by Microsoft - obtain Microsoft's written permission
to work on programs designed for other operating systems, including the
products of Novell, Microsoft's largest competitor in the PC software
market.
Microsoft specifies that the programmers should not be allowed to
participate in the 'design and/or development, feedback, or guidance of a
company product that is competitive with (Windows)'.
Identified in the text of the agreement as one such competing technology is
OpenDoc, a standard that is being developed by Apple Computer, WordPerfect,
Novell, Borland, IBM and others to enable programs from all developers to
work together more efficiently. Microsoft is not part of this industry
group.
This restriction would preclude collaboration among the supporters of
OpenDoc, said the legal counsel of one of the software companies in the
group, thus preventing the development of a (non-Microsoft) competing
industry standard.
After receiving a complaint from WordPerfect, Microsoft agreed on Friday to
remove references to OpenDoc from the NDA. Microsoft also said that it would
drop the three-year time commitment in agreements with WordPerfect and
others.
'We want to assure our customers and the software industry that our
objective is to make Chicago (code-name for the new version of Windows) and
all our operating systems compatible and open, and we will respond
constructively to any concerns raised,' said Mr Paul Maritz, senior vice
president.
Nonetheless, Microsoft has 'provided the Justice Department with further
evidence for potential charges that Microsoft is discriminating against some
companies in the access that it provides to an essential facility,' said Ms
Wendy Goldman Rohm, author of a forthcoming book on Microsoft's antitrust
struggles.
Under US anti-trust laws, an 'essential facility' is something that the
market needs and cannot duplicate. 'Microsoft is clearly discriminating
against companies that may be in a position to create an alternative
software standard, thus ensuring that Microsoft standards will be the ones
adopted by this industry,' said Ms Rohm.

   Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are scheduled to unveil Monday a long-awaited software package known as OS/2 Presentation Manager. 

   The new program, slated for introduction at a New York news conference, represents the two companies' response to Apple Computer Inc., which has been capturing market share from IBM and the so-called clone makers in the lucrative desktop-computer arena for business users. 

   Industry experts expect Presentation Manager to imitate many of the graphics features popularized in Apple's Macintosh computers, features that make the computers easier to operate for lay users. 

   Microsoft, the software giant, is the publisher of Presentation Manager, as well as the earlier operating system software known as MS-DOS. 
An operating system acts as traffic cop for data inside desktop computers. 

   Separately, Microsoft introduced yesterday the newest version of its popular word-processing software, called Word. 
The new version, Word 5.0, is designed to run on the latest IBM-compatible operating system, called OS/2.

sound, may be just around the corner, but the market's pacesetters are still
arguing over just how much hardware muscle users will need to get the full
"multimedia experience.";   One camp, led by Microsoft Corp., insists that
millions of current IBM-compatible personal computers are good enough to be
multimedia machines with the addition of a CD-ROM drive and an audio board.
International Business Machines Corp., on the other hand, argues that
multimedia requires far more power and that most users will have to buy a new

<TEXT>     At stake, in part, is who will control the development of multimedia
software and reap the rewards of what experts expect will be a huge new
market. Also at stake are the wallets of consumers, who may invest in
multimedia computing equipment but be disappointed for a year or more as they
wait for a critical mass of software to develop.;   There is little doubt that
major computer companies like IBM, Apple, Microsoft and Intel Corp. are
serious about multimedia. Last month's Comdex trade show in Las Vegas
showcased plenty of multimedia demonstrations, including a huge IBM booth
devoted only to multimedia. A video board co-developed by Intel and IBM was
named the best new product of Comdex by Byte, a computer enthusiast magazine.;
  Microsoft, the Redmond, Wash., software maker that dominates personal
computer operating systems, also wants to be the driving force behind
multimedia.;   Multimedia computing is a personal darling of Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates, who is attempting to buy the rights to create and
distribute digital images of the world's greatest art objects. That has helped
push multimedia into a prominent position in Microsoft's business and has led
to a long effort to establish hardware standards for multimedia computers.;  
Microsoft's plan is called MPC, short for Multimedia Personal Computer. A
basic MPC machine is a standard PC AT-compatible machine with a 10MHz 286
processor, combined with a CD-ROM drive to hold the huge amounts of data
required, an audio board, a color screen and a version of Windows with added
CD-ROM features.;   Tens of millions of existing computers could be upgraded
to MPC machines for $700 to $1,000 and would be able to run any multimedia
title that displays the MPC logo. Microsoft is betting those numbers will
encourage software developers to create MPC titles -- which in turn boosts
Microsoft's revenues for Windows and multimedia programming kits and its
influence in a major new market.;   Eleven companies are backing Microsoft's
MPC plan, the chief being Tandy Corp. Tandy is offering both complete MPC
machines and upgrade kits that add an MPC-compatible CD-ROM drive and audio
card to existing computers.;   But IBM, which this year has largely severed
its once-intimate relationship with Microsoft over operating systems, is also
at odds with its former partner over multimedia. IBM insists that users will
need at least a 386SX processor, which means not only a more expensive
computer but also that millions of users will have to buy a whole new machine
if they want to use multimedia features.;   For IBM, of course, that would
mean some of the vast new hardware sales it seeks. If it can sink MPC, IBM
will also gain more influence in the multimedia business, and that will help
pave the way for its work with Apple in the Kaleida joint venture recently
announced.;   IBM officials say that while they like the concept of MPC --
standardizing machines so one version of a title can run on millions of
computers -- the industry must give up trying to force old 286 machines to
display video and reproduce sound.;   "The implementation is seriously
flawed," said Michael Braun, IBM's vice president of multimedia. "If you're a
developer, you want to create compelling applications. You're going to require
more than 16 colors, more than a 286. You're going to require, if you want to
sell to the home, sound that's the equivalent of what you're used to (from
CDs). An application like that is either not going to run on an MPC machine or
you're not going to be happy with it.";   Microsoft counters that the more
powerful machines are great for developers or for some of the business
applications that IBM believes will initially fuel the market.;   "It
represents a difference in what markets we think are viable," said Hugh Chang,
a multimedia product manager for Microsoft. One chief target for Microsoft and
other MPC companies is "browsers," users who will neither create nor edit
multimedia presentations but rather "just listen and learn," Chang said. "We
believe that for browsers, the 286 is fine.";   But some analysts say that,
even for browsers, the basic MPC hardware is too weak.;   "IBM has made a very
good case that the hardware for multimedia in the MPC spec doesn't cut it,"
said Tony Bove, a multimedia analyst in Gualala. "They're absolutely right
about 16-bit sound, and they're right about the 286 processor: It's
brain-dead.";   The question also remains whether browsers will spend as much
as $1,000 for an MPC upgrade kit to install on a 286 computer that itself is
worth only a few hundred dollars.;   No matter what hardware they choose,
users face a dearth of multimedia titles: By the end of the year, only about
40 to 45 MPC titles are expected to be for sale, according to Chang, and 10 of
them are for programmers.;   "There's a great potential -- next year," Bove
said.  </TEXT>

FT  23 AUG 93 / Peering through Microsoft windows: Probe by the Justice
Department may distract computer software giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Justice Department's decision to pursue an anti-trust investigation
of Microsoft makes it increasingly likely that the world's largest computer
software company will face charges of illegal anti-competitive business
practices.
Justice officials disclosed on Friday they had initiated an inquiry after a
preliminary review of evidence gathered by the Federal Trade Commission in
its three-year anti-trust probe of the company.
Simultaneously, the FTC said it had voted to close its investigation of
Microsoft after deadlocking - in February and again in July - on whether to
take action against the company. Mr Donald Clark, FTC secretary, warned the
company that the commission's decision should 'not to be construed as a
determination that a violation may not have occurred'.
'The Justice Department's involvement represents a much more serious threat
to Microsoft than it faced from the FTC,' said Wendy Goldman Rohm, author of
a book soon to be published on Microsoft's anti-trust battle.
The FTC had narrowed its case against Microsoft to issues unlikely to have a
significant financial pact on the company. But the Justice Department is
expected to broaden the case, raising the possibility of tougher sanctions
and even, perhaps, an order to break up the company. Microsoft has denied
any wrongdoing and insists it will be vindicated.
But the case raises serious concerns for the Clinton administration, which
has identified high-tech industries as the 'engine for economic growth'.
Microsoft is a prime example of the enterprise the administration aims to
encourage: a world market leader that has demonstrated US competitiveness.
The company recently reported its 18th consecutive year of growth in
revenues and profits. Over the past five years Microsoft's sales have grown
by an average 46 per cent a year to reach Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.48bn) in
fiscal 1993, ending June 30.
Microsoft dominates the market for personal computer operating systems,
programs that control the basic functions of a PC. Microsoft's MS-DOS is
used on more than 90 per cent of PCs. Microsoft's 'Windows' program, which
provides 'point and click' control for PCs, is also a runaway success with
over 30m copies in use.
Competitors claim Microsoft's success has come at their expense, alleging
the company abuses its dominant role in the PC operating system software
market to exclude or disadvantage competitors.
But a recent study suggests Microsoft has been the driving force behind
software industry growth. The study, by Telecommunications Research Group,
concludes almost 500 companies have been formed in the US to create PC
software to work with Microsoft's Windows, with more than 17,300 jobs
created. Microsoft Windows has created an industry of new companies that
together have annual revenues of about Dollars 280m, and more than Dollars
1.3bn in incremental revenues for established software firms, the study
concludes.
Yet the vast majority of these companies are very small. The typical
software firm employs just six people and generates about Dollars 560,000 in
annual revenues, according to TRG. All are beholden to Microsoft, reknowned
as an aggressive competitor.
Microsoft's role in the industry is frequently compared to the power that
IBM wielded in the computer market of the 1970s and early 1980s. Just as in
its heyday IBM set industry standards, dominated markets and instilled
'fear, uncertainty and doubt' into competitors, so today Microsoft can call
the shots in the PC industry.
Ironically, such comparisons have taken on a new dimension. Just as IBM
battled through 13 years of Justice Department anti-trust investigation,
from 1969 to 1982, so 'Big Green', as Microsoft is nicknamed in the computer
industry, now faces similar scrutiny.
Although the Justice Department ultimately dropped its anti-trust case
against IBM, the investigation had a serious impact which many analysts
believe contributed to its inability to keep pace with changes in the market
and to its current problems.
The government collected 760m documents from IBM during its 13-year
anti-trust investigation. 'IBM's top executives were afraid to put anything
down on paper for fear the government would subpoena the document. Lawyers,
who were developing a stranglehold on the business, decided what could be
said at meetings,' says Mr Paul Carroll in Big Blues, The Unmaking of IBM,
to be published next month.
Microsoft faces a period of intense scrutiny that seems certain to consume
the attention of its senior management. The anti-trust investigation could
prove to be a serious distraction for a company renowned for its tight
focus.
Nothing would please Microsoft's competitors more.
'I've developed a view that being successful is not a fun thing sometimes,'
Mr Bill Gates, chairman and chief executive, said recently. 'There is just a
phenomenon where people don't like a company as successful as ours.'

   SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge set a June 13 hearing to
consider allowing Apple Computer Inc. the right to bring new
charges in its copyright infringement suit against Microsoft
Corp.
   At issue is the validity of a November 1985 agreement in
which Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., licensed to Redmond,
Wash.-based Microsoft certain aspects of its popular
Macintosh operating system. Apple has proposed to federal
Judge Vaughn Walker that it be allowed to amend its suit
against Microsoft to include charges that Microsoft breached
the 1985 agreement when it subsequently developed operating
systems with visual displays that increasingly resembled the
Macintosh. If proven, the charge would be grounds for
canceling the agreement, Apple contends.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 1985 agreement is at the core of Microsoft's defense
against Apple's copyright infringement charges, and its
cancellation could prove disastrous to Microsoft. But a
spokesman for the software giant asserted that the
enforceability of the agreement has already been established
in rulings by Judge Walker.
   "There are no material facts in these allegations that
have not come up before," said William Neukom, Microsoft vice
president for law. "Like Yogi Berra said, this is deja vu all
over again."
   At the hearing, Judge Walker is also to consider a motion
by Hewlett-Packard Co. to reconsider a March ruling in which
he found that Apple's screen displays were original works, an
important test of copyright validity, and that Apple had
adequately disclosed pre-existing programs when it initially
registered the works with federal copyright authorities.
Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is a
co-defendant in the case because of a license agreement it
had with Microsoft.

FT  23 NOV 93 / Technology: Window opens for IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM has just announced 'OS/2 for Windows', a version of its personal
computer operating system that sidesteps Microsoft. Until now, IBM has been
paying about Dollars 20 (Pounds 13.40) to Microsoft on each copy of OS/2
sold, for a total of about Dollars 80m.
OS/2 for Windows will deny Microsoft tens of millions of dollars in future
royalty payments as IBM puts its marketing efforts behind the 'Windowless'
version of its operating system. IBM expects OS/2 for Windows to double the
monthly shipments of OS/2 by the end of December.
'Most PC users already have a copy of Windows and have already paid the
licensing fee. There is no reason why they should pay twice for software
they already have,' says an IBM representative. OS/2 for Windows allows the
IBM operating system to merge with a PC user's copy of Windows 3.1, allowing
Windows, Dos and OS/2 applications to run on the same system.
However, IBM could face potential problems with this approach.
'I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft produces a future version of Windows
that prevents other operating systems from hooking into it,' says Jesse
Berst, industry analyst and editor of Windows Watcher newsletter.
John Roberts, group product manager for Windows at Microsoft, says that OS/2
for Windows users might face problems running some business applications
that use Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding technology, allowing
different applications to share the same data.
IBM says it has found no significant problems in running Windows
applications.
IBM will continue to sell a version of OS/2 that includes the current
version of Windows, but once Microsoft releases new versions, IBM will no
longer have the rights to include updated Windows software in OS/2.

<TEXT>
THE US Federal Trade Commission yesterday delayed a decision on what action,
if any, to take against Microsoft, the world's largest computer software
company, following a two-and-a-half year anti-trust investigation.
The stock market reacted positively to the news that the FTC had failed to
decide on how to proceed with the anti-trust case. Microsoft's share price
jumped to close at Dollars 89 for a net gain of Dollars 4 1/4 on the day.
The commission will reconvene 'in the near future' to continue its
deliberations over the case.
The outcome of the anti-trust probe has been closely watched because it
could have a broad impact throughout the computer industry. Microsoft is the
premier supplier of software for use on personal computers.
The delay, announced after a four-hour meeting of the commission in a
statement that referred to 'a non-public matter' and did not name Microsoft,
may suggest Microsoft is attempting to fend off any FTC action against the
company.
Microsoft has denied any wrongdoing and said yesterday that it is
'continuing to co-operate fully with the non-public FTC investigation. Mr
Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive, is said to have met with
FTC officials earlier this week.
However, investigators from the FTC's Bureau of Competition are believed to
have recommended that the commission seek court injunctions against
Microsoft to halt allegedly unfair practices.
According to Microsoft competitors, many of whom have provided information
to the FTC, these practices include the way the company sells and prices its
personal computer operating system, MS-DOS. Microsoft offers discounts to PC
manufacturers who agree to pay Microsoft a royalty fee for every PC they
sell, whether or not the buyer chooses to use the program.
Since MS-DOS is the standard PC operating system it is used by the vast
majority of PC buyers. However, companies that offer alternative programs
argue that they do not have an opportunity to compete.
Another issue said to have been investigated by the FTC involves the alleged
'tying' of sales of applications programs to those of operating systems in
which Microsoft holds a virtual monopoly.
Microsoft competitors have also expressed concerns to FTC investigators
about the company's alleged practice of favouring its own applications
programs developers by giving them early access to new versions of operating
system software, thus putting competitors at a disadvantage.
While the FTC could in theory file anti-trust charges against Microsoft
demanding that the company be broken apart, this is not expected. There is
also a possibility that the FTC could decide that no action should be taken
against the company .
According to industry analysts, however, a middle course is more likely. The
FTC might, for example, seek a court order prohibiting Microsoft's operating
system and applications divisions from sharing information. Or the company
might be ordered to halt its current operating system licensing practices.
Any such action would not have a significant impact upon Microsoft's sales,
industry analysts said.
To limit the effects of the FTC's decision, Microsoft could circumvent a
potentially lengthy trial by entering a consent degree, agreeing to the
FTC's demands. Mr Gates is said to favour bringing the matter to a close as
quickly as possible.
The 'non-public' anti-trust investigation has been common knowledge in the
computer industry since soon after it began and the potential for some form
of punitive action against Microsoft has cast a cloud over the company's
otherwise bright future.
For fiscal 1992, to end-June, Microsoft earned Dollars 708m , up 53 per cent
from the previous year, on revenues of Dollars 2.76bn, a 50 per cent
increase.

   Ashton-Tate Corp. and Microsoft Corp., in an unusual display of amity between two of the Big Three in personal-computer software, will announce a software product agreement here today, industry sources said. 

   The sources said Microsoft will announce the introduction of software that manages databases on computer networks. 
It will produce that software relying on technology supplied by Sybase Inc., a closely held concern in which Apple Computer Inc. holds a minority stake. 

   Ashton-Tate will license the software and produce a version of its dominant dBASE database program that runs on a single personal computer but will work with the Microsoft/Sybase network software. 

   Analysts said the software should help Ashton-Tate remove some of the considerable concern over whether it can update the venerable dBASE product to keep up with the new generation of computer hardware and operating-system software. 

   For Microsoft, analysts said the agreement will ensure that it can offer the general public the sort of products that International Business Machines Corp. has promised its customers with its newest line of personal computers. 
The software for the IBM machines, called the "extended edition" of Microsoft's new OS/2 operating system, is designed to let IBM personal computers talk more easily to each other and to extract information from minicomputers and mainframes. 

   Two software offerings are required to duplicate the benefits of IBM's new operating system on non-IBM machines. 
Microsoft has already announced the first, software developed with 3Com Corp. that manages communications between computers in a network. 
Today's announcement will introduce the second necessary product. 

   Ron Posner, an industry figure who was until recently executive vice president of Borland International Inc., said, "What Microsoft hopes to do is make (its software) a standard before 'extended edition' becomes one. 
Microsoft is hoping that at the least there will be two standards, its and IBM's." 

   He likened the situation to what happened with Microsoft's Windows product, a piece of software that lets personal-computer users move more easily between applications. 
IBM was pushing its rival product, called TopView, but Windows caught on before TopView ever got rolling, and TopView failed. 

   Mr. Posner had discussed an arrangement with Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, similar to the one Ashton-Tate ultimately reached, while he was with Boreland. 
He guessed it will take Microsoft six to 12 months to produce the software based on the Sybase technology. 
He noted that Sybase originally developed its product for the Digital Equipment Corp. VAX computer, which is far more powerful than a personal computer and has far more resources to devote to operating-system layers of software. 
"Microsoft hasn't yet shown that they can downsize Sybase," Mr. Posner said. 

   Mr. Posner, who also used to work for Ashton-Tate, said the announcement should help the Torrance, Calif., concern deal with heavy competition provided by Oracle Systems Corp. Oracle sells a single type of database software compatible with the whole range of computer hardware, from personal computers on up to mainframes, and has been selling corporate accounts on the idea that this makes it easier to move data between different sized machines. 

   Mr. Posner said the Sybase technology will make it a lot easier for Ashton-Tate customers to draw information down from big computers for use in dBASE products on personal computers. 
But Ashton-Tate will still have the problem of developing a version of dBASE that will let many people use it on a network simultaneously, Mr. Posner said. 
He isn't unbiased, given that while he was at Borland he had been responsible for Paradox, a major product rival to dBASE, but many in the industry share his feeling that rivals are gaining on the Ashton-Tate program. 

   David Readerman, a securities analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said Ashton-Tate's agreement with Microsoft allays some of the worry about dBASE's future. 
But he also said he'll be "underwhelmed" unless the announcement also includes talk of a partnership giving Ashton-Tate access to technology that won't be available to its competitors. 

   Mr. Posner said, "Short term, it's a good solution, but, long term, I think it makes Ashton-Tate and Microsoft more direct competitors." 
Microsofts' having software to manage databases on a network means it will bring out similar software that will run on the individual personal computers hooked up to that network, Mr. Posner said, which would mean competition for dBASE. 
"I don't see the relationship lasting too long," Mr. Posner said.

   Remember the fight between the rival VHS and Beta
videotape standards? The Battle over PC software standards is
similar, with the same high stakes for manufacturers and
users. But the PC battle has extra layers of complexity.
Here's a map of the action:
   Most PCs fall into two groups -- the IBM camp and the
Apple Macintosh. In general, the world of PC software today
can be divided into products written for the Macintosh and
for IBM PCs and their clones.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The original IBMs were controlled by an operating system
called DOS, made by Microsoft. Four years ago, IBM and
Microsoft jointly developed a new operating system, OS/2,
which was designed to make IBM machines more powerful and
easier to use. In particular, it made IBM machines look a lot
like the famously easy-to-use Macintosh. Instead of typing in
strange commands, users could move a mouse device along a
menu of options sometimes depicted by symbols. A file folder
might represent a file, for example, and so forth.
   Last year, the battle took a twist, when Microsoft came
out with a new version of a program called Windows. Windows
turned out to be a good shortcut for DOS users who wanted
that famous Macintosh look. Instead of replacing DOS with
OS/2, they could get very similar results for a lot less
money by keeping DOS and adding Windows. That inflamed the
standards battle and made it look as if Microsoft were
diverting revenues for its IBM Os/2 partnership towards the
company's own coffers.
   Most people still use old-fashioned DOS alone, but the
battle for the next generation of PCs today has three camps:
Macintosh, IBM with OS/2, and IBM with DOS and Windows. All
three look increasingly alike -- a resemblance that is the
subject of Apple's lawsuit against Microsoft. For now, all
three camps make money for different companies and require
different designs for software makers.

FT  31 DEC 94 / Engineer of the electronic era: Bill Gates, chairman and
co-founder of Microsoft, is the FT's Man of the Year. He talks to Louise
Kehoe about his vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Bill Gates and Paul Allen formed Microsoft in 1975, their slogan was:
'A personal computer on every desk and in every home.'
At the time, it was an outrageously ambitious proposition, since the
personal computer was little more than a toy for computer hobbyists. Today,
however, that vision is rapidly approaching reality, with more than 45m PCs
sold worldwide this year alone.
The vast majority of those PCs run Microsoft software programs such as the
Windows operating system and applications like Word and Excel, the
spreadsheet. This has made the company - based at Redmond, near Seattle in
the north-west Pacific state of Washington - by far the largest software
publisher in the world, with revenues of Dollars 4.65bn in fiscal 1994.
Microsoft's success has also made Gates the richest person in the US, with
an estimated net worth of more than Dollars 9bn (much of it tied up in
Microsoft shares).
These achievements alone make Gates a man whose every pronouncement is
scrutinised by the computer industry and analysed by investors. But in 1994,
he has added further to his stature, with plans for products that will bring
the information superhighway into every sphere of life.
Microsoft's planned acquisition of Intuit, announced in October, adds
Quicken, the leading PC personal finance program, to the company's software
portfolio. Gates recently unveiled plans to create the Microsoft Network, a
global online service supplying information, bulletin boards, electronic
mail and entertainment to PC users through cable and telephone lines.
The company has also fended off challenges to its business practices -
alleged to have been anti-competitive - from the Federal Trade Commission
and the US Justice Department's antitrust division. A cloud that has hung
over the company's future for four years has been lifted.
But it is as an architect of the next industrial revolution - the
convergence of computer, communications and entertainment technologies -
that we choose Gates as our Man of the Year for 1994. In an end-of-the-year
interview with the Financial Times, he predicts that such technologies will
soon have an impact on every sphere of life - commerce, education,
communication, medicine and entertainment.
Within the next decade, Gates says, information highways will link most
businesses to their customers and suppliers. Wallet or wristwatch PCs will
be able electronically to transfer funds directly to shop cash registers, as
well as store personal identification documents and even family photos.
Doctors will have direct video links to emergency response teams. Teachers
will have access to resources that enable them to bring multimedia lessons
to the classroom. Interactive television services will provide news and
entertainment in the home tailored to the user's personal interests.
'We are investing way, way, way in advance to create the software platforms
and tools for such services,' Gates says. Microsoft has 600 programmers
dedicated to this effort and many more working indirectly on his long-term
goals.
'It is a huge investment and it is based on our belief that these kind of
electronic applications will catch on in a very big way before the end of
the century. Our investment level is predicated on having millions of people
hooked up to broadband (high speed, multimedia) networks within the next
three or four years.'
The pace of computer technology change is accelerating, Gates warns. 'Every
company is going to have to avoid business as usual. The only big companies
that succeed will be those that obsolete their own products before somebody
else does.'
While others in the computer industry may consider Microsoft unassailable,
Gates says he is driven by a 'latent fear' that the company could become
complacent and allow itself to be overtaken by nimbler competitors. It
happened to other large computer companies such as IBM, he points out.
In pursuit of his 'information highway' strategy, Gates is reaching beyond
the computer industry to form partnerships with telephone companies such as
BT and France Telecom, with cable television networks such as
Tele-Communications of the US, and with publishers and Hollywood producers.
A partnership with Visa, the credit card company, could allow secure online
purchasing of goods and services.
Making computers more user-friendly is essential to the proliferation of
information highway services, Gates believes. Microsoft plans to create
easy-to-use, fun 'social interfaces' for the intelligent electronic devices
of the future.
The first product of these efforts will be launched next month. Code-named
'Utopia', it is a first attempt at anthropomorphism in the PC industry, a
program that endows the desktop computer with a 'personality'. Users will
choose one of 10 cartoon-like characters as a friend and helper, guiding
them through tasks, reminding them of things that need to be done and
finding information on other computers via telecom networks.
Gates views the new-found success of the CD-Rom - discs that can store large
amounts of information in the form of text, pictures, music or video - as
the most important development in the PC industry this year. For years,
Microsoft's attempts to interest the PC industry, software publishers and
others in the CD-Rom fell flat. As the publishing medium for computer games,
reference books, shopping catalogues and other PC programs, it is now the
key in creating a new generation of 'multimedia PCs'.
'Really to see that electronic publishing form take off is pretty
fundamental and it carries us into the next phase of computing,' he says.
That next phase is the development of online services. 'People are really
starting to see the PC as a communications tool,' says Gates. 'Look at the
explosion of electronic mail, the Internet and growth in online services.'
He acknowledges that Microsoft Network will face significant competition,
particularly in the US, from existing services such as Compuserve and
America Online. But he seems to relish the battle: the company will create
superior software technology, he claims.
'We have about 50 things that even in the first version will be far better
than the online services have. We will make it very easy for people to do
electronic mail, use bulletin boards, make purchases online . . .
'Even eight or nine months before we get into the business we have had an
impact. Established companies are starting to think: 'Oh, we had better get
more content, do better marketing.' Already we are making the market more
competitive.'
Such boasts give substance to the charge of his critics - and there are many
in the computer industry - that Microsoft effectively dampens competition
with its grandiose 'pre-announcing' of its planned products. Because of the
company's dominance and resources, few software groups can risk a
head-to-head market battle.
This was one of many complaints about Microsoft investigated in the past
four years by the Federal Trade Commission and the US Justice Department's
antitrust division. The investigation ended this year with an agreement, due
to be approved in court next month, involving minor changes to Microsoft's
software licensing practices.
Gates is surprisingly sanguine about the investigation: 'It is to be
expected, when somebody is as successful as we are in an important part of
the economy, that regulators would review the situation to see if it is a
competitive market.'
He complains, nonetheless, that Microsoft is unique in having been
investigated by two government agencies. 'There are not many people who have
had every electronic mail message and everything that they have done
subjected to the kind of scrutiny that we had here.'
The end of the antitrust investigation has not, however, ended the barrage
of criticism and 'Bill bashing' from industry rivals.
One frequent accusation is that Microsoft is not an innovative company.
Rather than inventing new products, it copies the ideas of others, critics
maintain. Windows, Microsoft's PC operating system program, for example, is
still seen by many as an imitation of Apple Computer's Macintosh software.
Most of the criticism is sour grapes, says Richard Shaffer, president of
Technologic, an industry consulting group. 'Like the Japanese computer
companies, Microsoft may not be an inventor, but it perfects products. It is
more important to get the product right, than to be first.'
Getting the product right, however, is proving to be a drawn-out effort for
Windows 95, Microsoft's newest version of Windows. Recently the company
announced that the product will not be available until next August, three
months after its last 'due date' and almost two years after the product was
originally expected.
Gates says the delay is not significant. It is more important, he maintains,
that the product should be compatible with the broad range of PCs and
applications that are currently in use.
Fear of Microsoft's unbounded ambitions and envy of its success are
undoubtedly at the root of much of the criticism that the company receives.
But Gates's personal style does not help. While he can be charming and
friendly on a good day, he can be testy and abrasive, even in front of TV
cameras. At industry gatherings, he often seems condescending, dismissing
any challenge to his ideas. In company meetings, he is prone to outbursts.
'That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard' is a typical Gates line.
'Part of Bill's style of presenting, clarifying and challenging ideas is to
be very blunt and a little bit dramatic and some would say a little rude,'
says Steve Balmer, Microsoft executive vice-president, one of Gates's
closest friends for 20 years. 'But he is a lot less rude than he was 10
years ago]'
Apart from a Porsche sports car and a Dollars 35m mansion under construction
on the outskirts of Seattle, Gates is not conspicuous in spending his
wealth. One exception was his purchase in November of an illustrated
manuscript by Leonardo Da Vinci for Dollars 30.8m.
He likes to keep his private life private. Newly wed to Melinda French, a
Microsoft product manager, Gates bristles at any mention of his personal
life, which he does not consider a matter of public interest.
Said by some to be the computer industry's answer to Henry Ford, and by
others to be the most powerful US businessman since Rockefeller, Bill Gates,
at 39, still has plenty of time to outdo both.

   Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.
are deadlocked in a dispute over future royalty payments that
could total tens of millions of dollars, say people familiar
with the negotiations.
   The dispute, between the two most influential companies in
the personal computer industry, centers on a decision by IBM
to incorporate code from Microsoft's Windows program in a
future version of its OS/2 operating system software, called
2.0.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   People familiar with the matter say IBM wants to pay a
fraction of the roughly $35 it usually pays Microsoft for a
copy of Windows. Microsoft insists that IBM pay close to the
full amount. The Windows code is essential to IBM's claim
that OS/2 will be able to run Windows applications "better
than" Windows.
   Both companies cite passages in their cross-licensing
contracts to support their respective positions and believe
they can settle the "differences of interpretation" without
resorting to arbitration or legal action, one person said.
Nonetheless, the dispute appears to signal an escalating of
hostilities between the one-time partners. Neither IBM, based
in Armonk, N.Y., nor Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., will
comment on the matter.
   The outcome of the dispute may help determine whether IBM
can lure away a substantial number of Windows customers in
favor of OS/2. OS/2 and Windows have a list price of about
$150 each.
   "If IBM has to pay a big royalty to Microsoft for the
code, it may make it hard for IBM to keep the price of OS/2
low," said Rick Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.
   The dispute represents the second time IBM and Microsoft
have argued bitterly about royalty payments in the past year.
   IBM pays a royalty to Microsoft whenever it sells a copy
of OS/2. Microsoft helped develop early versions of the
program.
   This summer, IBM made a lump-sum payment to Microsoft of
more than $5 million in overdue royalties related to sales of
OS/2, ending a squabble that began the prior October.
Microsoft says it is the biggest single payment it has
received from IBM.
   IBM says it voluntarily paid the royalty after an internal
audit showed that it had substantially undercounted the
number of OS/2 copies sold world-wide. Last fall, the total
number of OS/2 copies sold by Microsoft and IBM totaled
barely 300,000.
   In April, IBM said the figure was 600,000. The use of the
600,000 number coincided with the start of a push by IBM to
revive OS/2.
   In a July interview, William Gates III, Microsoft's
chairman, suggested that IBM may have inflated the number of
copies of OS/2 it has sold to make it seem that OS/2 is more
popular than it actually is.
   Mr. Gates said that IBM made the royalty payment only
after Microsoft in April threatened to publicly contradict
IBM's claim regarding OS/2. Mr. Gates said he essentially
told IBM to "pay up for those bragging rights" to say that
600,000 copies of OS/2 had been sold, Mr. Gates added.
   IBM strongly denies Mr. Gates's charges. "Mr. Gates's
claim is absolutely inaccurate," said a spokeswoman.
   IBM and Microsoft were close allies during the 1980s but
turned into bitter rivals when they split over the future of
PC software -- Microsoft choosing Windows and Big Blue opting
for OS/2.
   The royalty dispute illustrates how difficult it is for
IBM and Microsoft to free themselves of one another. That's
because they continue to be at least partly ruled by a
patchwork of contracts that give each the rights to certain
system software developed by the other.
   System software, which handles the basic operations of a
computer and creates its distinctive "look and feel," has
become a battleground in recent years because many makers of
personal computers, including IBM, have come to believe that
whoever controls system software essentially defines the
features of a PC.

FT  02 FEB 93 / Technology: Unix's survival at stake - Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW days before Christmas last year, Novell, a US computer networking
company whose annual sales are now close to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) signed
a letter of intent to acquire Unix Systems Laboratories, a company in which
AT&amp;T has a majority stake and which is responsible for the licensing and
development of the Unix computer operating system.
The deal, worth Dollars 350m, has to be ratified by 11 other computer
companies which own shares in USL. These include Amdahl, Fujitsu, ICL,
Motorola and Sun Microsystems. It is nevertheless remarkable, given the
history of Unix, that there has been a dearth of comment on a development
which may fundamentally reshape the open systems movement. It may simply
have been the imminence of the New Year; others see more sinister forces at
work.
To recap briefly: open systems imply a common set of rules for interworking
so that no supplier has a technical advantage over any other in developing
standard products.
Unix is one of a number of operating systems vying to be adopted as the open
systems standard. The development of such an operating system would have to
be free from the control of any one manufacturer or group of manufacturers.
Unix was created by AT&amp;T at Bell Labs but has since been widely licensed,
leading to a damaging multiplicity of 'standard' versions. These include
Sunsoft's Solaris and IBM's AIX.
The competition includes IBM's personal computer operating systems OS/2, the
Open Systems Foundation's OSF1 and Microsoft's Windows NT, a new operating
system which has yet to be launched commercially.
AT&amp;T established USL, and encouraged other companies to Take stakes in it,
to promote the idea of Unix development independent of itself or any other
company. In doing so, it showed it had learned the lessons of the 1980s when
plans to establish a standard Unix between AT&amp;T and the aggressive
workstation company, Sun Microsystems, provoked an industry war.
Novell, however, is one of the industry's newly emerging dominant forces
with some 60 per cent of the global market for networking software. The
1990s are set to be the decade of computer networking so Novell, along with
Intel and Microsoft, can claim to be an architect of the new world order in
computing.
So by selling off USL to Novell, has AT&amp;T thrown away the idea of an
independent Unix? And if it has, does it matter?
The answer to the latter question would seem to be 'No', judging by the lack
of controversy over the proposed sale. Why should that be?
One possible answer is that AT&amp;T and the rest of the industry are already
anticipating that Windows NT will be the operating system of the future and
have thrown in the towel.
Windows NT - standing for 'New Technology' - is Microsoft's first multiuser,
multitasking operating system suitable for powerful network servers. It is
Microsoft's attempt to lay siege to the market for enterprise-wide
computing, taking advantage of the shift away from mainframes and mainframe
operating systems.
Microsoft has a deserved reputation for tenacity in bringing reliable
products to market even if there are several false starts on the way. But
coming as it does from a background in stand-alone personal computers, it
has little experience of enterprise data processing. It knows this very well
and is taking steps to remedy its deficiencies.
But multiuser computing is complex and critics argue that Windows NT will
have to go through several versions before it approaches the reliability and
robustness of Unix.
Many believe that Unix represents the best opportunity of developing a
genuinely open operating system for the 1990s and beyond. With the loss of
an independent USL, however, there may be again a proliferation of Unix
variants - to nobody's advantage.

companies which own shares in USL. These include Amdahl, Fujitsu, ICL,
Motorola and Sun Microsystems. It is nevertheless remarkable, given the
history of Unix, that there has been a dearth of comment on a development
which may fundamentally reshape the open systems movement. It may simply
have been the imminence of the New Year; others see more sinister forces at
work.
To recap briefly: open systems imply a common set of rules for interworking
so that no supplier has a technical advantage over any other in developing
standard products.
Unix is one of a number of operating systems vying to be adopted as the open
systems standard. The development of such an operating system would have to
be free from the control of any one manufacturer or group of manufacturers.
Unix was created by AT&amp;T at Bell Labs but has since been widely licensed,
leading to a damaging multiplicity of 'standard' versions. These include
Sunsoft's Solaris and IBM's AIX.
The competition includes IBM's personal computer operating systems OS/2, the
Open Systems Foundation's OSF1 and Microsoft's Windows NT, a new operating
system which has yet to be launched commercially.
AT&amp;T established USL, and encouraged other companies to Take stakes in it,
to promote the idea of Unix development independent of itself or any other
company. In doing so, it showed it had learned the lessons of the 1980s when
plans to establish a standard Unix between AT&amp;T and the aggressive
workstation company, Sun Microsystems, provoked an industry war.
Novell, however, is one of the industry's newly emerging dominant forces
with some 60 per cent of the global market for networking software. The
1990s are set to be the decade of computer networking so Novell, along with
Intel and Microsoft, can claim to be an architect of the new world order in
computing.
So by selling off USL to Novell, has AT&amp;T thrown away the idea of an
independent Unix? And if it has, does it matter?
The answer to the latter question would seem to be 'No', judging by the lack
of controversy over the proposed sale. Why should that be?
One possible answer is that AT&amp;T and the rest of the industry are already
anticipating that Windows NT will be the operating system of the future and
have thrown in the towel.
Windows NT - standing for 'New Technology' - is Microsoft's first multiuser,
multitasking operating system suitable for powerful network servers. It is
Microsoft's attempt to lay siege to the market for enterprise-wide
computing, taking advantage of the shift away from mainframes and mainframe
operating systems.
Microsoft has a deserved reputation for tenacity in bringing reliable
products to market even if there are several false starts on the way. But
coming as it does from a background in stand-alone personal computers, it
has little experience of enterprise data processing. It knows this very well
and is taking steps to remedy its deficiencies.
But multiuser computing is complex and critics argue that Windows NT will
have to go through several versions before it approaches the reliability and
robustness of Unix.
Many believe that Unix represents the best opportunity of developing a
genuinely open operating system for the 1990s and beyond. With the loss of
an independent USL, however, there may be again a proliferation of Unix
variants - to nobody's advantage.
